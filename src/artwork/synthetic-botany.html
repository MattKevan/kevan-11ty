<p>Synthetic Botany is a StyleGAN model I trained that creates new illustrations of plants in the style of renowned artist-explorers such as Pierre Joseph Redouté and Mary Vaux Walcott.</p>

<p>Trained on over 2700 real illustrations, the model is able to generate a near-infinite number of previously undiscovered species.</p>
