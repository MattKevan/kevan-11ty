<p>Synthetic Botany is a <a href="/articles/2021-12-17-training-stylegan-with-a-custom-dataset/">StyleGAN model I made</a> that creates new illustrations of plants in the style of acclaimed artists and explorers like Pierre Joseph Redouté and Mary Vaux Walcott.</p>

<p>Trained on over 2700 real illustrations, the model is able to generate a near-infinite number of previously undiscovered species.</p>

<p>In 2022 I was commissioned by <a href="https://www.claybavor.com" target="_blank">Clay Bavor</a> to create <a href="https://www.claybavor.com/neural-generated-botanical-prints" target="_blank">an hour-long video</a> to be displayed in a digital picture frame, cycling imperceptably between plants so that it always showed something different without obvious movement.</p>
