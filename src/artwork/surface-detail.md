    <p>I've always loved to doodle as a way to help me focus, covering whatever paper I have with abstract shapes and lines. In fact, doodling was what got me into design in the first place: in college my tutor would often complain to me that this was a chemistry lesson, not an art lesson. Taking his advice seriously, I switched courses and did art instead.</p>
    <p>Thanks to Procreate on the iPad I've been able to take doodling to the next level. Each of these drawings took between six months and three years to complete.</p>
