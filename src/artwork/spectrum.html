    <p> For this series I set myself the challenge of creating an abstract image per day using only lines and two colours: a dark grey background and a contrasting colour.</p>
    <p>This colour should start with red and increment through the RGB colour space by three points for each picture.</p>
    <p>I've currently created 255 of a possible 510 images, cycling from red to cyan through yellow and green.</p>
