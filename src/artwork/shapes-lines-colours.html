    "<p>For this series, I challenged myself to create at least three pieces of abstract art a day. I was only intending the project to last a few days, but I enjoyed the process so much I continued for over a year and more than a thousand images.</p>
    <p>I had two rules:</p><ul>
    <li><strong>No self-editing.</strong> I had to go with an idea without thinking too much about whether I liked it. This meant some pieces are better than others, but the goal was to practice creating quickly, not to create a perfect image.</li>
    <li><strong>Only use an iPhone.</strong> Restricting myself to a small screen and limited features meant that I had to focus on the idea, rather than getting caught up with the tool.</li>
    </ul>"
