    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanography">Cyanography</a> is one of the earliest photographic print processes, invented in 1842 by Sir John Herschel. It was used later that year by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Atkins">Anna Atkins</a> to create the first photographic book.</p>
    <p>Commonly used to reproduce drawings and plans – hence the term 'blueprint' - the cyanographic process can also be used to create expressive and unexpected images due to its low resolution and lack of tonal control.</p>
    <p>I created these images from photographs I'd taken by painting the light-sensitive emulsion on watercolour paper, applying a full-size acetate negative and exposing with ultraviolet light. After washing and drying, these were the results.</p>
