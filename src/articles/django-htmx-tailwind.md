A starter project for Django based on [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox) by Will Vincent. This adds a few extra features I found I was adding for every project, as well as switching the front-end framework from Bootstrap and jQuery to Tailwind, HTMX and Alpine.js.

### Installation

Clone the project and move into the directory.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MattKevan/djangox-tailwind.git
$ cd djangox-tailwind
```

Create a new virtual environment and activate it.

```python
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate 
```

Rename env-sample to .env and add your site key as well as any other variables. If necessary, you can generate a site key here.

```python
mv env-sample .env
```

Install the requirements and set up the database. The site will use SQLite by default, but it's straightforward to use Postgres instead.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python manage.py migrate
```

Set up the superuser, entering your email, username and password.

```
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Launch the site at http://127.0.0.1:8000

```
python manage.py runserver
```

### Tailwind

Open a new terminal tab, ensuring your virtual environment venv is activated. Start the Tailwind development server with:

```
python manage.py tailwind start
```

This will watch for changes in your template and theme files and use browsersync to refresh the browser.

Create a build optimised for production:

```
python manage.py tailwind build
```
