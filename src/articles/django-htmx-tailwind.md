* Environment variables with python-dotenv.
* Media file support via Cloudinary.
* Django 4.2 & Python 3.11.
* Install via Pip or Docker.
* User log in/out, sign up, password reset via django-allauth.
* Static files configured with Whitenoise.
* Debugging with django-debug-toolbar.
* DRY forms with django-crispy-forms.
* Custom 404, 500, and 403 error pages.
