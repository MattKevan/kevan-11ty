### 1. No surprises

Everyone involved in a project needs to have a thorough understanding of the project and what it's trying to do. This is hard to achieve. For a project to go well, everyone needs to have the *same* understanding, and that understanding needs to match the *actual* goals of the project. This is almost impossible, and has led to many successful careers in writing books and leading workshops.

Never assume that everyone understands the same thing - when you talk about a

The whole team - designers, developers, product managers, stakeholders and the wider organisation should have an understanding of both the problem that’s being solved and the approach taken to solve it. This requires carefully considered communication with all parties. Not everyone needs the same level of detail or frequency of communication, but if someone is surprised by what is proposed or what has been released, a communication failure has occured somewhere. 

Consider creating a [stakeholder power/interest grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_analysis) and communications plan when starting projects to understand your stakeholders and decide how best and how often to communicate with them.

Never assume everyone understands the same thing. Every person involved will have a different understanding of your project's goals. This is especially true for people who are not deeply involved or if what they do only touches one aspect of your project, but can also apply to core team members and stakeholders. 

Restate the problem and the project's goals as often as you possibly can - at the start of every meeting, in every email and much more besides. Consider even creating a shared vocabulary with the team so that you can be more confident that when a term is used everyone understands roughly the same thing.

### 2. No deliverables

UX activity is often focused around creating deliverables – journey maps, personas, detailed UI designs etc. A lot of effort is put into making them look nice. And then they're never looked at again.

But as with most things UX, the process is the important bit, not the outcome. For example personas and empathy maps are useful because the process of creating them helps build a shared understanding of your users between your team and stakeholders. The final format doesn't matter as long as it serves as a reminder to the discussions you had. This could be a photo of a whiteboard, a Miro or Figjam board, or even a big sheet of paper covered in post-its.

The same goes for most UX deliverables. They are tools for communication, not ends in themselves. Don't just 

### 3. No handovers

Passing designs to developers often feels like throwing them over the wall, hoping they're caught '

We don’t work in isolation, handing over our work at the last minute. Instead, we collaborate early and closely with developers as a single team to understand the problem, scope possible approaches and work to a shared solution.

### 4. No signoffs

While we may need approval for legal or compliance issues, we don’t need signoff before going live. Stakeholders should be well aware of the project and have had ample opportunity to contribute earlier in the process. And we should be confident in the quality and fitness-for-purpose of what we have created.

### 5. No last-minute changes

Last-minute changes mean that something has gone wrong in the project somewhere. It could be a communications failure in that someone wasn’t fully aware of the implications of a decision, or maybe the problem statement wasn’t properly explored at the beginning. It’s better to go back to the start and rethink things than release a broken or compromised product.
