## Background

Illustrators\.co was a curated multi-vendor marketplace for illustrators to promote and sell their artwork. 

With a similar model to Etsy, sellers were responsible for managing and dispatching orders, with the site taking a small fee from each sale. Launched in 2012, it was joint project between and Oliver Jelf and myself.

We featured over 30 artists, both up-and-coming and well established, including [Tom Gauld](https://www.tomgauld.com), [Tony Meeuwissen](https://folioart.co.uk/illustrator/tony-meeuwissen/), [Martin Grover](https://martingrover.com), [Laura Hughes](https://www.laurahughes-illustrator.co.uk) and [Marcus Walters](https://www.marcuswalters.com).

While Illustrators\.co had to close in 2018 due to work and family pressures, it was an enormously fun project: it kicked off a career in user experience and web development, I met loads of interesting people and had the chance to stage an exhibition in a [major national gallery](/articles/lineup/).

### Technical notes

I built the site with Drupal 7, Ubercart Marketplace and Stripe. This was the first project I'd built of this scale and complexity - a head-first dive into Drupal, front-end development, SEO and e-commerce.
