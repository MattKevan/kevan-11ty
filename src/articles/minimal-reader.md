I love ebooks for their portability and convenience, but I've never been happy with the actual experience of reading one. They just don't provide the same level of enjoyment that a well-designed physical book does. 

That's why I've never liked the Kindle â€“ it's just not a nice reading experience: the device is plasticky and cheap and the book typesetting is often dreadful. I try and look past it and focus on the content, but even after tweaking the settings as much as possible it still doesn't feel right.

I've also tried every single ebook reading app available for iOS and iPadOS and it's a similar thing. Either they're old, badly designed or just don't work how I'd like them to. For example, the page swipe.

Page turns are great for physical books (there's a reason we don't use scrolls any more), but for digital books it doesn't make sense. It's a skeuomorphism that can be safely ditched. On a digital device, where scrolling is a natural interaction, I'd much rather scroll as I read, rather than having to break focus and swipe the screen the next page. Some book readers, like Apple Books, doesn't support vertical scrolling at all.

So I decided to make my own book reader. How hard can it be, I thought, when ebooks are basically just a bundle of HTML and CSS anyway?
