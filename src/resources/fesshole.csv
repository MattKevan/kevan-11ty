I thought limes were unripe lemons until I was 21 when I tried to convince my housemate who needed a lemon to buy a lime and then just wait for it to ripen.
"When I was 12 I had a paper round and used to get in the shop at 5:00am, because I knew the porn mags would be stacked up in the back room. Used to pinch loads and sell them in school, made a fortune, double market price."
"On first dates I used to arrange to meet in a public place, usually a pub. I would enter with a pre-typed text on my phone 2 mins away press send and then look to see whose phone went off. If I didn't like the look of them, I'd leave immediatley and never bother them again."
"If I'm feeling too lazy to brush my teeth, I'll pop a little bit of toothpaste on my tongue and swish it around like mouthwash. Job done."
When I shower I tease my hair into a Mohican. I look in the mirror and imagine I'm a dirty street punk high on speed and booze. In truth I'm a 57 year old middle manager in local government.
"Moments ago, I nearly took a bite out of my earbud and stuck a crisp into my ear."
"I told my manager I'm an alcoholic. I'm not, but I wanted to stop being invited to work drinks with my seriously boring colleagues. It worked."
"I keep loosing my wedding ring. But it's ok, as we only ever got budget rings on Amazon as we were on a tight wedding budget at the time. I have about 10 spare left in the draw."
My smartwatch logs any kind of repetitive hand movements as steps. It takes 600 steps to bring my wife to orgasm on average. Our record is 247 steps.
"I was a heavy weed smoker for 20 years. I stopped 2 years ago and since then I've fallen out with half the people I know. Not the weeds fault, I've just realised what absolute horrors they were."
"At school we were asked to write down the name of someone we'd lost. I hadn't lost anyone, so l put down Roz Forrester from the Dr Who New Adventures - Adric would've been weird. Later that day we had a mass in our church, and the priest read out the whole list."
Still got a tape deck in my car so on nights I can't sleep I'll get up and drive around listening to old John Peel shows. Bit worried I might get pulled over for something but not sure what it would be.
My dad set up a monthly direct debit of £50 to me when I was a student. I guess he forgot to cancel it because it's still in place. I left university 25 years ago and have my own mortgage and family; some months that £50 has meant we don't go completely to the wall.
"I was making a real effort not to pirate films and TV but media companies are so damn greedy, deciding they all need their own streaming service, that I've gone back to pirating everything I can. Saving a fortune."
Had running competition to get Britpop song lyrics into a school assembly messages with another teacher. Lost when he raised his mic Gallagher style whilst wearing a parka and shades for Lord's prayer. He's a Catholic school Headteacher now.
Got talking to a lad in a wheelchair in a pub. He had lost his legs. Few pints later I bump into him in the toilets. He asked me for help getting on to the toilet. He was a lot lighter than I was anticipating. I banged his head against the ceiling tiles. I left sharpish.
"I took a photo of a waterfall near Perth in Scotland and labelled it 'Waterfall by Aberystwyth' sent it to a competition run by the Welsh tourist board, won second prize and it was the February photo in the Best pictures of Wales' calendar that year."
35 years ago there was a massive dog shit in the school yard which I secretly put an empty coke fan on top of. I then challenged a friend to see if he could kick the can over an adjacent hedge. He did. Bloody hell - he had to wear his PE shorts for the rest of the day.
"Come thesis season at uni, I sabotaged the printer by scrawling tons of cocks on the paper and reloading the tray. Some big, some small, but all decorated with a jizz fountain. I would sit by and watch students either melt down or proceed to the binder. A true win-win situation."
"A few years ago I moved to China on business. The job fell through but I had already paid rent, so I applied for a job as a copywriter. Turns out it was writing fake online reviews. They had 1000s of employees and worked for many well known brands. Don't trust ANYTHING online."
"I bought a second hand PS4 from eBay for £50. The previous owner hadn't wiped his account so now I get free Sky, BT sport and Netflix. Thanks eBay account GaryStar1977"

"I was 16 or 17 and got home very drunk. So drunk, in the night I pissed in the corner of my bedroom. In the morning my mum saw and smelt it and went crazy. I quickly pissed in her bedroom too, without her seeing, then blamed the dog. The dog was never allowed upstairs again."
I once asked a girl out and she said she doesn't like men with beards. I said I have a beard to cover a skin condition on my jaw. She felt guilty and gave me a pity date. It went well and we've been together for 3 years. But now I can never shave it off.
My worst one night stand experience as a student was when I went back to a guy's house and when he came he shouted Tubby custard! His housemates all cheered. I ghosted him for that even though the rest of the date was really good.
"I'm a grown man who sits at the front seat on the top deck of the bus so children can't. The look on their stupid faces when they see me, a grown adult living their dream."
"In TK Maxx, saw a jumper discarded over the top of a rail of clothes. I liked it but couldn't see a price tag. As I pulled it over my head to try it on, a wallet fell onto the floor, picked it up, handed it to the guy staring at me. He asked if he could have his jumper back too."
My wife has started calling me 'mate'. I fear this could be the beginning of the end of our marriage.
Had to go for a nervous poo immediately before getting married. No loo roll to be seen. Said I do with a dirty arsehole.
I just printed an empty page at work because i was too lazy to bend over and take one out of the printer tray
FROM ADMIN: We've got a best of @fesshole book coming out. Do pre-order it - thank you. https://t.co/QFvJ5RIona
"This is my wife's confession really, but when betting on the Grand National I asked if she wanted an each way bet and she thought the horses had to run the course both ways to win."
For 30 years I've added a single grain of coffee into every cup of tea I make because my mum once claimed she can taste when I stir your father's coffee first. She never caught on. It's 5 years since she passed and I still make tea with a single grain of coffee. Miss you mum x
Joined loads of 'Brits Abroad' groups on Facebook and stir things up by warning them about baked beans and Cadbury shortages. It is cheaper that watching a firework display.
"If you are a prick at the bar, such as if you click your fingers, wave a £10 note or are generally a bit go a cock then you will get charged 'twat tax'. The criteria and percentage for this tax is set by your server. I usually make at least £30 extra on a Saturday."
My university put start dates - not end dates - on their student cards. I lost my card in my final month of my PhD in 2017 & got a new one. Been claiming free McFlurrys for 5 years - even though I'm a school teacher and my local maccies is mostly staffed by my students.
I put the radio on before I leave for work so the dog isn't sitting alone in silence. I then listen to the same radio station while driving to work so we're listening to the same thing. It just makes me feel like we're together at home for a little bit longer.
Whenever I get a bit of piss on the toilet seat 
 I just put my foot on the seat and wipe it off using my sock. Apparently it's disgusting but I'm just saving toilet paper
"I work in a charity shop, The Thursday Murder Club by Richard Osman has over taken Fifty Shades of Grey as our most donated book ever in recent months. Not had one copy of Bob Mortimer's biography yet though"

"My son hooked me up with my ex-wife's Netflix account. Whilst anonymously watching a series, I couldn't continue until agreeing a price increase - so I agreed to it."
Sometimes after having a shower I use my dirty underpants to clean around bits of the bathroom.
"I once had a temp job in University admin printing degree certificates. On my last day, I printed myself a certificate with the award of MA in Interpretive Dance."
My husband and boyfriend have the same name. I've got a massive crush on my boss. When I have sex with my boyfriend he thinks I'm calling out his name in pleasure when really I'm thinking about my boss.
When I'm at Nando's I feel guilty spending £20. To save a few quid when the food comes out I always say I ordered 2 perinaise and they bring them out. The peri peri hustler
"When I was about 8, I read on a Perrier mineral water bottle that it was 'Bottled at Source'. Was a good ten years before I realised Source wasn't a town in France."
Having two young kids we need to sneak in nooky when possible. One morning we were in the middle of some tomfoolery when we were interrupted by our eldest. He jumped into bed with us but then insisted he could smell the ocean. Needless to say we quickly adjourned for breakfast.
I had a job to get unemployed folk back to work. My first success was a bloke that I got a job as porter at the local hospital. He was arrested & in the papers 6 months later. He'd been caught having sex with dead bodies & I'd used him as my case study for our laminated brochure.
"One April fools I drained my housemates bottle of Original Source Zesty Lemon Shower gel, and filled the bottle with Lemon Curd. Took him a weeks to realise why his hair was dull and sticky."
I read in Jason Manford's autobiography about him walking out on his telesales job and how it was the best feeling. I decided to do the same in January and felt nothing but dread and fear. I am currently 3 months unemployed and skint.
"I'm quite vanilla in the bedroom, so when girlfriend asked, I said I was kinda into feet as it was the first thing that came to mind. Now she's my wife of 8 yrs she gives me regular foot jobs, which I don't really want and are honestly quite underwhelming."
I had to give one of my favourite jumpers to a charity shop because I saw Sonia wearing it on Eastenders and I couldn't bear to wear the same top as Walford's fun sponge
"Briefly did job as binman, in days before u had to place bins out front. I'd hunt for anything in a binbag, down side path or beyond, remember thinking it strange they were stored in a greenhouse, & there were 8 of them. Realised later I'd chucked all their garden furniture."
"FROM ADMIN: We've made a slightly more serious bot, to call out ad agencies who preach green stuff on #EarthDay  whilst working with the oil industry. It looks for their tweets and then dunks on them. If that's your bag then follow --&gt; @greenwashbot"
"I'm always on at my 5 year old son to aim properly when using the toilet. He's pretty good at not spraying everywhere now. Me on the other hand, not so good, especially after a drink or two. When the wife notices, he always gets the blame. Sorry my little dude."
Used to run a toy shop. I used a black marker to give a toy cow an 'Adolf' style hair & moustache then put it on the shelf. It sold within 10 minutes because 'This cow looks like Hitler'.
"My wife left her menstrual cup next to the sink, later I came into the bathroom to find my five year old boy happily drinking water from it. I've been banned from ever telling another soul. Embarrassingly for me this is also how I found out what a menstrual cup looked like."

"I finish my emails by writing Many Thanks before my signature. A few years back I did a typo and wrote Manky Thanks to someone, which they pointed out to me. I now type Manky Thanks purposely to everyone I don't like."
"Growing up I realised we weren't well off as a family, only as an adult did I realise how poor we were. For a family day out we would visit the dogs home with absolutely no intention of bringing a dog home with us. It was our equivalent of visiting the zoo."
Wow. Well done you bastards. Keep at it. https://t.co/4gsqw0qcrc
"When my ex broke my heart, I took a piece of Lego from each one of his Lego sets. He won't be complete without me and neither will his Lego. Still miss him."
"Whenever I sell something on eBay, I always have a good nosey at the purchasers house on Street View"
"Our dog attacked a hedgehog in the garden. Assumed the hedgehog was dead and put it in the wheelie bin. Next day went to put a bag in there to find it munching away on some potatoes, had to dig the poor fucker out from its all you can eat buffet and popped him over the fence"
I use find my iPhone to check where the kids are to make sure they won't arrive home when hubby & I are having sex.
Every month at work we have a 'star of the month' The lucky recipient gets a picture of them stuck on the staff room pin board. Every month I draw a moustache on the person. It has now reached the level that everyone blames each other and I join in with the gossip.
"As a masturbation obsessed teen, I decided to experiment with putting things inside my penis during the act. Thought I'd best start off with something small, and opted for a soapy match. First and last time I ever tried that."
"When I was a kid, I used to think that you were given a young-sounding name when you were born, something like Ben, but when you became an old man, you had to change it to something like Arthur or Seth."
I regularly tell door to door sellers that my parents aren't home. I look really young but i'm actually 30 and live alone.

"Every Wednesday afternoon I would put on my Outlook calendar a 2 hour meeting for CCS. The senior managers would always ask How's CCS getting on I would reply Brilliant, they love our attendance and we are forging a great relationship CCS is Costa coffee shop."
My husband insists on showing me how small his penis gets every time after he exercises. I try to be supportive but it looks like a thumb and is a major turnoff.
When my other half asks for a decaf coffee I usually just give her caffeinated because the lid is slightly easier to open
Son received a load of helium balloons for his 10th birthday. He's complained that they keep popping as at least one is gone every day when he gets home from school. They're not. I work from home and am getting increasingly bored. I inhale the helium for fun and do silly voices.
I was once in a corner shop where the owner was saying nobody would steal from him as he's too smart. For my own satisfaction I stole a Mars bar as he was talking

We moved in to our new house about a month ago and I've only just discovered I've been putting the oven on the grill setting. I refuse to admit to my girlfriend that I was wrong so now every meal takes about half the time to cook.
I broke up with a partner of 8 years because she insisted that if we had a child we'd have to name it after her dead uncle: Hugh
"When we were kids, I convinced my young sister that crisps with loads of seasoning on, you know the ones, were too hot for her and that I should have them instead. I'd mime pain while eating the most delicious ones like I was doing her a favour. It lasted until she was fourteen."
"At a 12th birthday party me & another mate went up to the loft of this lads house, above his parents bedroom, and for reasons I still can't explain decided to piss all over the loft in unison. Soaked the insulation. Jesus the stench"
When attending a customers home as a tradesman I'll often hand them a five pound note as they answer the door and claim it must belong to them as I found it on the path. The instant trust this creates makes it a lot easier to overcharge them later on.
"I was at a car boot looking at a £1 piggy bank, didn't want it until I saw £20 note inside. The sellers were old and unaware. I bought it and felt soooo bad"
"When I was an AOL tech, it took me 5 cheek-biting minutes to get a customer to tell me their screen name so I could look up their account - we had a CallID system and I could see all along it was mad4cox."
"In 1985 I borrowed some books from the library. Threw them in a skip so I didn't have to pay the fine sometime in 1997. Changed my name when I married, have moved home multiple times since then but I'm still scared they'll find me and make me pay"
Lied on a date about having a Harley Davidson to sound edgy & secure sex. 3 months in got serious so had to get motorbike license & spend my inheritance on an overpriced motorbike I look like a twat riding.
When I was little my parents would always have the first sip from a can of drink to take the taste of the metal away. I thought this was a real thing until I asked my partner to have the first sip of a can. I was 25.
Wrote my final paper for my Honours degree sick with Covid. It was a 5 day online test. Wrote half of the paper and used AI bots to write the rest. Spend a day making sure it passes plagiarism scans. B+ final mark.
"Found out that the local quizmaster did the exact same quiz the night before elsewhere, managed to get the answers and cheated. We even got one wrong on purpose. Got no joy from it at all, especially when the pub gave us a standing ovation. However the free beer was great."
I've been dying my ginger pubes brown the whole of my 25 year marriage. It started because I was young and embarrassed. 
 I've come too far to own up now. I shall take my ginger Bush to the grave.
I never leave Nando's with out a big bottle of Peri Peri.
"Met a really lovely bloke, sweet, kind and funny. Only problem was the sex was terrible. I put this down to his inexperience and told myself that this would get better with practice. 4 years later we bought a house and had a baby but the shagging is still shite…life isn't fair."
"I hate it when people don't clean their pets' eyes. Whenever I meet a cat or a dog, I have to scratch off any gunk in the corner of their eyes."

When I'm dragged kicking and screaming to IKEA I make it my mission to pocket as many free small pencils and measuring tapes as possible. My record is 58 pencils and 22 tapes.
"About 20 years ago I went to a cash machine and the person - I didn't see who it was - before me had not lifted their £250 so I handed the money into the branch. Well I was going to but the branch was closed. I still feel guilty. A wee bit, but still feel guilty"
"At school, it was cool to wear your rucksack over one shoulder. I was never cool but as a working adult, I still do this so that my colleagues might think that I am."
"Whenever my girlfriend feels really low, and she needs someone other than me to feel better, I always message her best mate to cheer her up. She's convinced he's connected to her psychologically and knows whenever she's sad. I'll never tell her, because it makes her so happy."
I have just mistaken a Dreamie for a stray crisp and eaten it. They aren't as tasty as cats make them out to be.
"We're doing our second live show on the 11th May in central London - do come, it'll be fun. "

"My husband and I worked really hard and successfully weaned our kids off the screen addiction they developed during lockdowns. It's great, but now they want to play all the time. I miss just dumping them in front of the box and relaxing."
Hated my job in Spar as a teen. Took my frustration out on the biscuits when I stocked shelves. I'd squeeze the packs and break them all. Some poor bastards probably got home looking to enjoy a cuppa and a hob nob only to open the pack to a bag of crumbs like a granola bar
Still had my ex husbands bank card on my PayPal for two years after he traded me in for a younger model. I've had countless beauty box subscriptions and self care treats for 2 years
"Used to shag a girl purely because I could call her after a night out and she'd pick me up, shag me in her car then drop me home afterwards. Was using her more so I didn't have to pay for the taxi rather than the sex."
"My Tesco shop was delivered last week, & in it was an absolutely huge bar of Cadbury's DairyMilk that I didn't order, nor pay for, upon checking my receipt. I didn't let on to the delivery guy, I kept it. I feel terrible when I think about the person expecting it. Still ate it."
I use Shazam to cheat at Heardle.
"Anyone remember them little hats on the innocent smoothie bottles? I collected them years ago and was about to throw them out until one day I decided to put one over my bell end for a laugh. I realised It's so warm and cosy, I now wear them through the cold winter months."
"Growing up, I loved the Toy Story franchise and now my young kids have Toy Story toys. One toy broke and I couldn't throw it away due to the profound impact of the films, so I've hid it in the loft with another toy to keep it company."
"When I was 8, I spent many hours on writing a letter to get onto television. I wrote in my best handwriting, added glitter and sequins. The letter was never answered. At the time, I was heartbroken but looking back I was glad Jimmy Saville didn't fix it for me to dress as Barbie."
Met a girl years ago through work. Fed head over heels in love with her but never did anything about it. Did once send her flowers anonymously for Valentine's. She thought that came from someone else and now they're married. Absolutely kills me that I did this.
"One Monday when I was on a massive come down I phoned into work sick and said I'd sprained my ankle. Not initially realising you can't recover in one day, I had to put a toothpaste cap in my shoe for a week to remind me to hobble."

As I child I spent my last 50p on a horseshoe game at a village fete. My three throws missed and the attendant wasn't watching so I lied and said they all hit and bounced off. The giant toy rabbit I won and the fete background music Love me for a Reason still haunt me. Liar
I've just arrived at work and one of my colleagues said he saw me and my wife strolling along the South Bank having a good time.
It wasn't my wife.
I can never bring my wife to social events now.
"Years ago, a boyfriend told me he couldn't go out cos he had work to do, then later that evening, pocket-dialled me. I could hear he was at a bar, so I deliberately stayed on the line in order to max out his pre-paid phonecard. We were pretty broke then, so he was livid."
"Wordle looks like good fun, to me, but I refuse to play it. The premise of the game is five letter words. Wordle is six letters. Idiots."
My wife made a jokey remark about light entertainer Darren Day. I've gone on a deep dive researching his work on Wikipedia and now I follow him on Twitter. I've started combing my hair like him. It's like that film Single White Female.
"Every evening when I check for updates on my phone I clear the history in my calculator app. If I croak unexpectedly, I don't want anyone to know from the super-simple calculations I've entered how crap I was mathematically."
"Sometimes me and my husband shower together and play a game called dick or digit. It's nothing sexual, he'll touch my back with either his finger or his flaccid penis and say dick or digit and I have to guess which one it is. We both get really competitive with it."
I understand that most people who use the herb and spice jars in Tesco use them to spell out sweary words. I spell out HORSE. Every time.
My mates fiancé really looks like Paul Simon and I have no idea how to tell him.
"I'm shit at using Social Media, and their apps. When posting on Instagram to tell everybody about the birth of my son, I accidentally instead posted a photo of some Instant Yeast I'd previously sent to my mate whilst asking for help with making pizza dough."
"Whenever I'm in a public toilet with two adjacent hand dryers, I put a hand under each one and imagine I'm having some sort of hand dryer threesome."
"I sometimes screw the lids on my kids' water bottles extra tight, just to feel wanted"
"Cooked a romantic dinner, after which me and my partner proceeded to have some fun. Within 5 minutes she was in the bath legs in the air washing her vagina with milk. I still had chillis on my fingers from cooking the dinner."
"I've spent a fortune on a turntable, amp and speakers. After a short spell buying vinyl's, old and new, I can't be arsed to get out my chair to turn the record over and now just stream music on Spotify instead."
I lived in top floor flat. A new neighbour moved in downstairs and kept practicing his bass guitar until 3-4 am. I asked him on several occasions to turn it down. No joy. For the next few months I'd intercept his dole check and throw it in the bin. He moved on pretty quickly.
"When I was 8.5 months pregnant, my alcoholic ex left me stranded in the snow to go out on the piss. By the time he got home, I had lovingly prepared spaghetti Bolognese. One quarter minced beef, three quarters Beef Whiskas. He ate that meal like a starving man."

Every day I search Twitter accounts that post the Wordle answer & block them. It's simultaneously petty and therapeutic.
"Every weekend I volunteer to hang out the washing, we have a spider living in the peg bag and I'm scared that if the Mrs spots him she is so scared she will make me kill him. We're are mates, I take great care removing/returning pegs and often apologise for the inconvenience"
I hide packets of crisps and biscuits in the boot of my car to prevent my teenage kids from consuming the lot & on the very same day the food shop gets delivered.
"Both my wife and I have agreed to cremation, when the time comes. She's just told me she wants our ashes mixed. OMG, even when I'm dead I won't get any peace and quiet."
"My wife keeps going through my Amazon account quizzing me on things I've viewed, it really winds me up, so last night I spent an hour viewing pregnancy clothes and newborn products along with books on extra marital affairs. Happy Sunday babe."
"When I was 9 I read a story about a cool character who stuck his chewing gum behind his ear. I did the same, it stuck to my hair so I had to use scissors. Had a mini bald patch & my mum found the hairy gum in the bin and said 'what. Is. THIS'."
"Quite drunk and needing a piss I went to the toilet in the club, fuck knows how I did this but I unzipped and pulled out my left bollock thinking I've got my dick and pissed myself."
I kept rejecting Netflix films suggested by my wife as they were always rated at a lowly 5.1. It was only recently I realised that the number refers to the surround sound.
"If someone I follow on social media announces they've hit a follower milestone, or says they only need X more followers to hit a milestone, I unfollow them."
Made the cat summoning kissing sound at my neighbour's cat while it was crossing the road. It stopped and started trotting towards me. Got flattened by a speeding car. Can't ever say anything.
"Whenever people ask me to guess their age I always take 5 years of my initial thought so i flatter and don't offend. When asked today by a colleague, i said  ohh i don't know, 55! She replied ohh close, 53"
"I'm a civil servant. Whenever I have to set a date for reminders/meetings towards the end of the month, I always pick the 29th as I have no idea which months have 30/31 days. The rhyme only confuses me further."
"In my 20s living in a shared house, I had to tell my housemates I had scabies. Some of them started to feel itchy too. We had to deep clean the house dispose of bedding & douse ourselves in strong chemicals. Turned out it was an allergy to a belt buckle, but I never admitted it."
"Fresh from an acrimonious break-up, I went out shopping. Seperate Lives, the Phil Collins ballad was playing instore and I broke down in tears. Staff were consolling me. I had to made up a fake illness to excuse my sobbing."
Early 80s and arcade video machines didn't have a flap over the coin reject hole. Some sketchy guy showed us how you could get a credit by shoving a 1p in this hole. Worked for a couple of years and I'd like to think I was partly responsible for invention of that flap.
"When I am walking my dogs on a cold morning I like to take a hip flask of whisky and drink some, pretending I am a cop from the 70s on a stake out trying to keep warm, rather than a borderline alcoholic"

"I love having the house to myself. Not because of the peace and quiet this affords, nor the fact I can take a bath without being interrupted. It's because I can read a book out loud, giving each character a different accent, acting my arse off as though in an audition"
I attend my daughters swimming lesson once a week. They are boring as hell but I watch her intently because I know after every length she glances up to see if I'm watching. All the other parents stare at their phones the entire time. My parents never watched me either.
"Sometime evenings, when I'm passing a particularly perilous poo, I feel a deep connection with Elvis In his final moments"
"One year on Xmas morning me and my younger sisters got up early and ate the contents of our stockings. Next year I got up first, ate all my sweets, then told my sisters Santa didn't give me any, so they shared all their sweets with me. They were 6 and 4. I'm a shit older brother."
"I'm staying at a holiday home, where the previous occupants have left the TV signed in to Netflix. I'm making sure the Daddy profile has a couple of really interesting entries under Continue Watching."
Before I do a big cough I say War and afterwards I say What is it good for?. I don't very often get a reply of Absolutely nothing!
My boss used to track our leave at work on a spreadsheet only she had access to. Whenever she took a week or longer off I would tell my colleagues that I happened to be off a few days that week too and not come in. Probably had about 20 additional days annual leave over 2 years
"My husband cheated on me with someone he works with & I always suspected but had no proof until he confessed. When he told me I had to pretend to be angry but I was actually relieved that I finally had an excuse to get rid of the miserable, alcoholic prick. Best thing he ever did"
As a youngster my friend and I were approached on the street by a bloke who had 'locked himself out' and offered us £10 to climb through an open window and let him back in to 'his' house. We spent it all on wrestling stickers.
"I'm 32 years old and still argue with children online over fifa. Recently I screenshotted my bank balance to win an argument, with what turned out to be a 12 year old. That'll learn him"
I play every lottery game in the National Lottery every day. And every morning there is a time between waking and checking my phone in which I am Schroedinger's Millionaire. Then I see I haven't won and I die a little.
"My wife saw me making tea using unfiltered water. She's convinced she can taste the difference. I've started using filtered water, but every once in a while I sneak in a batch of unfiltered water tea and she doesn't notice. These are my fave cups because they taste like crime"
Growing up we were not allowed chewing gum but my sister and I wanted to be cool and chew gum like everyone else. So we went round our neighbourhood scraping it off the street. We especially liked the pink ones. And the bit of grit that came with it
"My wife died two years ago. Periodically google reminds me I'm sharing my photo library with her. I know it's a hacking risk, but I like to think she's seeing the photos of me and our dog, and knows we're doing ok. I bet she's wondering why we were inside so much recently."
"Learning butchery wrecked my sex drive. Kills the mystique, once you've torn out the same organs & binned them."
When we first started dating I convinced my girlfriend that farting and belching in front of each other was cute and funny. Now we're married and it's like living with a builder from an 80s sitcom. I hate it.

As a schoolboy I used to buy foreign language newspapers and pretend to read them on the tube to make myself look intelligent. Until the day a woman pointed out the Chinese newspaper I was 'reading' was upside down.
"I've play on-line Connect 4. Alot. I find myself obsessively fantasising about a work-based scenario where someone will suggest a Connect 4 tournament for fun. I nonchalantly accept to take part, subsequently kick ass and am held aloft like Daniel San at the end of Karate Kid."
"Every day when my wife and kids have left, I make myself a cup of tea. I start by throwing the tea bag at the cup from the other side of the kitchen and if I get it in I celebrate wildly, like I've just won a World Cup or Olympic gold. They must never know."
"Last winter my granddaughter, who is registered blind, was staying with us for 10 days. In the run up to Christmas she was getting increasingly bored and I was out of ideas. As my wits' end I got her to wrap presents. Including her own presents."
I'm really bad at dirty talk and while my other half was fingering me I told him to put some welly into it and the shock to him was such that he stopped it and gave me a look that can only be described as pure bewilderment. Sorry darling

"Really liked this girl on a night out and my friend noticed. He gave her my number and we texted for a while before we finally met. Turned out he gave it to the wrong girl. Been together for 5 years now and all is well, but she must never know 😬"
"As a cub scout who helped at jumble sales in the 80s, I used to offer to hang up people's coats on the rack at the back of the hall. I'd go through their pockets looking for loose change when doing it. I'd spend it on sweets at the end of the day."
"I'll always try and have my breakfast at 8:10 during the week. The reason is predominantly due to Paddington Bear being on Channel 5, and that I think it's absolutely great. I'm 42 years old."
"I was fed up with my husband not bringing his own reading glasses out with him and always using mine. So I've deliberately bought a pair of bright pink sparkly ones with cat eye frames. He looks a bit of a twat wearing them in the restaurant, with his shaved head and tatts."
"On a 1st date, a lovely stroll around the River, with a girl and her Boxer, I needed to toilet so bad that I let her dog off the leash, sprinted after it, quickly dropped trou, did a poo all while out of sight. Then I blamed it on her dog. I watched her pick it up after."
"Until I saw Blur in Hyde Park in 2009 and until the guy from Quadrophenia came on stage, I believed Paul Daniels did the talky bits in Park Life."
"I used to work with a woman who was clearly well off financially, but wrote her name on her tub of butter so others didn't use it. Each morning I would get the tub and spread too much butter on my toast before scraping what wasnt used back into the tub with all the burnt crumbs."
"I've stopped giving my partner head, as they've switched to using Imperial Leather soap to wash themselves and the scent & taste of their cock reminds me of my grandparents, which knocks me out the mood faster than you can say 'Werther's Original'"
"In my piss-poor student days, I would frequently drink a bottle of beer, then refill it in the toilets. Then return it to the bar, complaining that my beer was too warm. The amount of times they gave me a fresh one and put the other back in the fridge was unreal."
My favourite thing to do at gigs is to sing really loud but badly so that people who film all the songs have their videos ruined.
"Whenever I have a shower in a Travelodge or Premier Inn bathroom, I draw a cock and balls on the steamed up mirror before it clears. The cleaners are too lazy to clean the mirror so when the room's next occupant has a shower they are greeted by a spunking knob on the mirror."

"When me & the girls go away for weekends to different cities, we take it in turns for it to be our imaginary hen weekend to get free drinks"
"I've been working as a trauma counsellor for the last 15 years. Recently my old university contacted me to say they gave me my degree in error and I would have to complete the last module of the course again. I did and smashed it, so no real harm done yes?"
I was self employed for about 4yrs. I never once paid tax. Not because I am an asshole but because I couldn't work out how to do it.
Hooked up with a girl at an office party that was so drunken I couldn't remember her name. Went out with her for a month before she cottoned on. She thought I was rifling through her mail to steal stuff. No. I was trying to work out if she was a Kate or Katie. She was a Kerry...
There used to be a woman who's walk-train-walk commute was almost identical to mine. She was a crazy-fast walker and for a bit I used her as a pacemaker for increasing my own speed; I always lost. I now realise this wasn't as subtle as I thought and would've seemed really creepy.
"We had a mouse infestation and didn't check the spare room before my aging mother came to stay for a few days. When leaving, she thanked us for the thoughtful use of lavender seeds under the pillows and inside the bed. My wife and I have never told a soul to this day."
I once climbed out of a window to escape a boring date. Sadly the window led to a dead end courtyard. After a struggle I climbed back in and told my date I'd been a while due to taking a big shit. We've now been together 18 months.
"Lodged with an old couple in Birmingham a few years ago. Dave and Barb. Salt of the Earth. Cheap rent so tiny house, ate together, watched tv etc. After 6 months I left. 'Bye Dave!' I said as we hugged. 'It's Pete,' he whispered. 'Dave why didn't you tell me?' I shouted."
When I was about 10 I had the realisation that you never have a poo without also having a wee. Shortly after that I heard the song that's goes thunder only happens when it's raining… and then spent the next 15 years singing that song in my head whenever I had a poo.
I always shit in work so I don't have to buy toilet paper
I was made redundant about 18 months ago. I understand times were hard during pandemic but it was blunt and sneaky. I logged into the company Dropbox account and permanently deleted a load of files as I knew they never backed up.
"I have worked as an office cleaner for years, I hate my job but I love deliberately always putting toilet rolls on the wrong way round. I get a thrill from imagining people wondering how they are always the wrong way round and then boringly moaning about it on Twitter"
My wife and I met through mutual friends years before we got together but I was too shy to talk to her. Even mentioned it in my wedding speech. Recently a friend put some photos of the night in question on Facebook. Turns out it was a similar-looking but entirely different girl.
Google Street View busted me holding hands with a woman who's not my wife. My face is blurred but it'd be clear to anyone who knows me that it's me. Fortunately it's in a place no one would think to look.
My wife works in the public eye. I use her Wikipedia page to make sure I don't forget her birthday or our wedding anniversary. I should be ashamed but I'm not.
"When the Trainline app asks me Is the train busy? I always answer yes, to deter upcoming travellers from ruining my enjoyment of an empty carriage"

A work email went round explaining that a very special mug had gone missing featuring a photo of the MD's wife and kids from the communal kitchen. It was sat on my desk with 3 day old tea in it. Didn't get the bonus I hoped so I donated it to charity shop.
"I often work from home, when I don't feel like talking to anyone due to a hangover, I create an MS Teams meeting with myself and my personal email address which I then join so people don't try and contact me"
My Wife and I have made several sextapes and taken lots of NSFW photos over the years. I have most of them saved on my phone and often look at them at work when I'm having a bad day.
"At a summer fete as a teen many years ago, a clown said to me in front of my mates who cut your hair?The council?. It was laughed off and forgotten by everyone else, but it still upsets me while doing my hair even now, over 25 years later."
"I was working with some right mealy mouthed miserable buggers in an office. I surreptitiously took photos of each of them, and put them in various framed art around the office."
"Another bus driver here: if your bus unexpectedly terminates before reaching the end of the route for operational reasons, there is a better than even chance your bus driver has been forced to kick you all off while they bolt for a shit or piss."
My kid is starting to be cleverer than me. He's 10. Fuck.
"When I was 17 I worked part time in Sainsburys. I used to drop a bottle of wine on the shop floor in the last hour of my evening shift so I could close the aisle, slowly mop it up and avoid any more customer interactions or annoying last minute manager requests."
At my old job I used to hate one of the managers. But she'd always bring in milk for her coffees so I made sure to drink every last drop of the milk and put the empty carton back in the fridge for her to find.
"I spent the entire shift of a dull student job listening to two female colleagues chatting in Greek, punctuated by filthy laughs. When I got up to go, I gave them a cheery smile and said kalinikta - good night. The panic on their faces was priceless. It's the only Greek I know"
"I am a woman but I use a second profile with a man's name and photo for Facebook interest groups. The difference is profound - no unsolicited messages, and more respectful and polite interactions with both men and women."
"Slept with someone new recently. Looked at our phones afterwards and were amazed by how long we'd been at it. She was all admiring, and I felt like a proper stud. Then we realised that while we'd been fucking the clocks had gone forward an hour"
Was in London and a local said to visit The Shard except from the accent I heard The Shire. Put on Google maps and spent 2 hours commuting. We asked the taxi driver if there are good views of London from it. Got to The Shire. It's a golf course and not the infamous Shard building
I used to pronounce the word niche like Sean Connery would nice until I was about 35.
Still cringe every time I have to say it nowadays.
"I once got a Caeser cut from my Polish barber, quite liked the style and kept asking for it every single time I went back. 3 years and a change of barber later I realised I'd just heard scissor cut with an accent."
"FROM @ROBMANUEL: Hello, I'm sitting here reading all your confessions and I love it but it does take me a lot of time going through everything and choosing what to post. If you fancy bunging me a couple of quid coz you appreciate what I put into this? https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"When I go to the pub, I always go on the slot machine. I always put in at £100 and then wait 10 minutes. After then, I press collect and everyone in the pub thinks I've won £100. The noise of the coins dropping out and the look from everyone is satisfying."

"When people leave work and their leaving card is doing the rounds, I write hearts and kisses under other peoples names, the more inappropriate the better."
"When bored on my first job laying out pages for a local newspaper, I would often purposefully mix up the star signs on the horoscope page, pasting copy for Leo under Scorpio and Aries under Capricorn etc."
"I was a self-employed theatrical producer, often buying props & costumes. I would pick up discarded till receipts in the street; if they showed cash payments for something I might feasibly use for work - food, clothes, anything - I kept them for my tax assessments"
"Whenever we book a holiday, I go back into the booking and request separate beds and look forwards to nights of glorious undisturbed sleep. My husband still hasn't worked this one out and thinks we're unlucky in room allocation."
Sometimes after dinner I pour a shot of neat squash into a fancy tumbler and sip it like it's a fine whiskey
"At the tail end of a wank, I have to get up from the bed, walk cock-in-hand to the bathroom and finish off into the sink. I catch myself in the mirror during climax and think what a loser."
I reserve a seat on the train and sit in the unreserved seat next to it. Always have space to relax
When I worked in Threshers there was a buy 2 get 3rd bottle of wine free. Every time someone bought a single bottle I wouldn't put it through the till. So every 2 single bottles bought I'd put them through the till together and I'd get the free 3rd one for myself.
"Police pulled me over and asked why I was driving up and down the road late at night , I came clean an explained my mileage was 80 thousand and 84 miles and I needed 1 more mile to make 80085, i.e. BOOBS."
I like to sound my car horn at complete strangers whenever I travel to a new town. I then proceed to wave enthusiastically at them to make sure they spend the rest of the day who the guy in the Audi was waving at them. Drives the wife mad.
"My other half has a teaspoon that I hate. It's too heavy and acts as a heat sink when making tea. Whenever I see it in the drawer I put it in the dishwasher, If i empty the dishwasher I leave it in"
"Having two kids under two was tough, and the best bit was blowing very aggressive raspberries on them. They're too old now to still want me to do it, so my husband lets me do it on him instead. I can do such a truly excellent range of fart noises, it may be my best skill."
"My then girlfriend was hassling me to get married, I only agreed, as my families marriage record was terrible and I assumed this would be the same, and it would only last a short time, like everyone else's.We've been married for 36 years now."
"I worked at an Indian takeaway. Sometimes, not long before my shift ended, I'd order a delivery to an address I knew was vacant. When it returned undelivered, the boss would give it to me rather than throw away."
I keep a detailed spreadsheet where I record details about my sex life and analyse it. I'm convinced it's made me a better lover but I can't tell anyone I ever sleep with this is how I learnt what works because it makes me look like a complete psychopath.
"Before a night on the piss, I always leave the TV on so if anyone is passing they think that someone is in. I check the TV guide first before picking a channel as I wouldn't want any potential robbers thinking I have bad taste in TV shows as well as nothing much worth pinching."

"I've only recently found out in my thirties that the '12M' on cosmetic bottles dictates shelf life, not how many metres underwater it can withstand."
I am a bilingual Brit living in Spain. I regularly translate famous British stand up comedians jokes into Spanish and tell them to my Spanish friends. They think I'm hilarious.
"I once worked for a major broadband supplier. If I had a particularly nasty customer on the line I would keep his set top box details, when I could see they were watching England play I would reboot the box, just when they were about the score. I had a huge list of people."
"At airport security when asked have you any liquids on you, I said yes 60% of what's inside my clothes is liquid. I was questioned and told them I was autistic so took questions very literally so they let me go with a telling off. I'm not autistic, just bad at jokes"
"A lady just made her toddler son sit on his dad's lap so I could have a seat on a crowded train. She thought I was pregnant. I am in fact, just fat and hungover, and you bet I took that seat."
"I used to be a street sweeper. You might think cleaning up at 4am on a Sat and Sun morning is a shit job, but the amount of free stuff I found made up for it. Cash, drugs, clothes. In one year, I found and sold six phones."
Friend wanted to try LSD so we cut a tiny square from a comic and gave it to her. She spent the next 24 hours tripping thinking she was a frog.
I turn 46 tomorrow. 46! And I've just realised that I absentmindedly used a plate I was carrying back from my daughter's bedroom to the kitchen just now as a steering wheel to navigate through our home. This probably wasn't the first time.
"Worked for a cabinet MP, the idea that there's an orchestrated global campaign to oppress us is laughable. He genuinely cares more about the RSPB and wheelie bins than anything else. Oh, and getting re-elected of course."
"For nearly a decade I have been telling people - when appropriate, not randomly - that I have a retrofitted uterus. My doctor finally corrected me this week: retroverted."
My wife asks why microwave popcorn tastes better when I make it. It's because I melt a load of butter and add it and don't tell her because she's worried about my cholesterol.
"When my wife pisses me off I put her marmite in the fridge, so that the next day it's hard to spread and fucks up her toast"
When I was younger I had sex with my girlfriend and I noticed when she orgasmed her eyes started rolling wildly which was really off putting.Whenever we went to have sex again all I could envisage was a vision of Marty Feldman's eyes.The relationship ended soon after.
I read every product review with the voice of Rick from Rick and Morty. Scarily effective at saving me money!
Up until I was about 14/15 I thought that you made cola/soda in a similar way to cordial juice. With about a third cup soda and topped up with water. Turns out we were just poor and that's how my parents made it last
"When I was 15, I stole two paperback books from a local bookstore. I knew the proprietor wouldn't know, because he was blind. It's haunted me my whole adult life. Now I give money every year to charities for the blind."

My mum thinks my kids send them a Happy Mother's Day to Grandma card each year. Truth is they can't be arsed and I have to write it with my left hand each year. I can tell she's worried my 11-year-old has handwriting issues.
Stag Party. We discover the stag's iPhone pin is 1234. We log in to his Moonpig app and send him a Frozen themed photo card with his mates nut sack on. His wife and young daughter open the card at home. Sorry.

"My wife and I had some great sex earlier, but I couldn't finish. I blamed it on the new antidepressants but it's actually because I had a wank earlier. Sorry love"

"The new guy in marketing pitched a brand idea to the MD, he loved it. I bought the domain name anonymously for 89p during the meeting on my laptop. They ended up paying me £2,000 for the URL."
I like to ring the phone number of the house I grew up in and ask to talk to myself. He doesn't live here any more. Oh I reply disappointed.

"When I was a teenager I once stopped a schoolbus, screaming hysterically, because there was a cat in the middle of the street. Walked towards the cat and it turned out to be black plastic bag. It was social suicide and I had to wear prescription glasses since."
"When tickets for big events go on sale, I add as many tickets as I can to my basket and leave them there until the basket expires and go back on sale so that people who aren't good at buying tickets can get some. It's my good deed for the week, I call myself The Ticket Picket."
When I was about 9 and feeling a bit bored I put a big rock on the ground and put a cardboard box over it. 3 fellas came along and 1 of them took a run at the box and gave it an almighty boot. He defo broke his toe. I sat there stone faced as if I knew nothing about it.

Me and my wife got married in between Christmas and New Year after I convinced her a Christmas wedding would be really nice. Really I just didn't want me or my mates to miss any football or cricket games on every other Saturday of the year.
Leaving my job soon. There's currently 170 holiday requests put in by staff. We can't afford to get them all covered and we don't have the man power. There's no audit trail so the day I leave I'm approving every single one.

"For a while when we had a cat, I'd catch fleas in our bed and they were so hard to kill - even with my fingernails - that I took to swallowing them when my partner wasn't looking."
Bin day is a huge relief every week. It wipes my alcohol consumption slate clean.
I work as a waiter. Anyone who is on a date and trying to impress a girl and is even slightly rude to me. I wait until they have taken a big bite of food before asking if everything is ok with their food.It soothes me.

Went to the toilet and noticed a foul smell coming from my vag when I wiped. Thought it must have been a bacterial infection. 2 visits to the GP and 3 weeks of antibiotics before I realised husband had bought cheap scented toilet paper
"Washing my hair over the bath today and the shampoo was out of reach. Water in my eyes, I couldn't be bothered to reach the extra foot for it. Nearer though was the dog's Fox Poo remover shampoo, so I used that. At my desk now and my colleague says my hair looks lovely."
Remember it's the first @fesshole live show this Sat night. It's sold out but there's a couple of tickets available from returns from people who can't make it. BUY THEM NOW. https://t.co/vlvRb5O8Bl
"When going to supermarkets, I first hide a 2 litre bottle of softdrink in one of the freezers behind the frozen vegetables. I then retrieve my nicely chilled bottle at the end of my shop. No way I'm spending twice as much for only 500ml just to have a cold drink on the way home."

My dad always asked for the Mahavishnu Orchestra to be played at his funeral but fucking hell I couldn't subject people to that. He got that John Miles song instead which I don't even know if he liked.
"Was at a charity event one night which came with a three course meal. First 2 courses weren't up to much, but the dessert was sticky toffee pudding. When it came out I lifted the table cloth and placed it on my knee, told a waiter I didn't get mine and ended up with two"

Bought a dishwasher 6 months ago and just assumed it was a bit shit. Turns out I just kept using the pre wash setting for 6 months. Absolutely fantastic now
"My wife has a real thing about not letting me and the kids walk anywhere inside our house with our shoes on. I'm currently off work with Covid and every morning after she's left for work, I go and put a pair of shoes on just to walk around the house all day."
At university I got so annoyed with housemates using my shower gel every day that when it got to last 10% I'd masturbate into the almost empty bottle and let them pour jizz onto their hair. No-one ever noticed.
Got circumcised as an adult. Worked out great apart from the first 3 weeks of morning wood with stitches that were put in while my penis was flaccid.
"Last employer sacked me with no notice right before Xmas. Expected them to do it, but had the last laugh by not signing them up for a corporate tax break of 10% off their energy bills for their very large factory."

"Every Christmas, my mum gets her address book out, the same one she has used since the 90s. We have a family competition of dead or alive. A constantly evolving game."
"When on a long escalator I play stick or twist with those coming the other way, on whether I'd like to sleep with them, or move onto someone else, as yet unseen, further down the queue. It helps pass the time although I've had to have imaginary sex with some grim sorts."
"During the 90s as a student, I worked in Wetherspoons in Twickenham and we had a dead pool, where you could 'buy' one of of the regulars - usually pensioners - for £3. If you 'owned' the next person to die, you collected the pool, I 'won' a few times."
"As a student I worked in a very high end boutique, and was sometimes acting manager on Saturdays. Once I bought a pair of £15 stilettos from Primark, destickered them, and put them on our middle-of-store plinth priced £480. Sold them by lunchtime, buyer paid cash."
"Whenever my nose is blocked, rather than blow it into a tissue I like to go outside into the garden and fire the snot out like I'm a professional footballer. Much more satisfying."
Little old charity shop lady said she loved the tie I was buying. Didn't have the heart to tell her it was for a costume and I picked it specifically because I thought it was ugly as hell
"Once when it was snowing, I held a charity shop door open for someone and they were too busy on their phone to say thank you, later on I saw the same bloke on his phone walk through the biggest pile of dog shit & trail it all up the road in the snow, funniest thing I've ever seen"
I had an appraisal yesterday. My boss told me that the work I've produced this year is some of the best he's ever seen and that I work really hard. Little does he know that I actually work 2-3 hours per day and spend the rest of it playing video games. I felt kinda guilty
"I am at the stage of marriage, and middle-age, where the Mrs won't put out unless I've cleaned, at least, the kitchen. When she's at work on Mondays, I get a cleaner in and claim I've done it myself. Everyone's a winner."
"Once a week I put a vague, random site visit in my online planner for 3 hours, switch my phone off and go to go to the cinema. That's been 14 months and no one has clocked on yet. Watched some utter rubbish in that time too."
"When I'm on a motorway and there's oncoming traffic on the other side, I like to imagine the cars are notes on what would be a life sized guitar hero, and I play them by tensing the muscles from my calf to my arse. No idea when I started this or why."
"Whenever somebody dies, such as a celebrity or if someone in an accident or murder has been named on the news, I find their Twitter, Facebook or insta account. I look through their last days, I don't know why but it absolutely fascinates me."
Never felt so betrayed and embarrassed as when absolutely every mate of mine bailed on my stag do. I was so grateful when COVID meant it was cancelled and refunded.
I tell city centre charity collectors that I am under 18 so they aren't allowed to ask me to sign up. I'm a 31 year old man.
"The sellers of our house were arseholes. Didn't take final meter readings, argued survey and gave us the moving date we pleaded not to have due to work. They didn't change their postal address. Have great glee in returning to sender post, including car tax and finance."
When our baby was 5 months old I made a deal with my husband. He could do the 11pm feed and the 7am feed and I would do the 2am feed. There was never a 2am feed.

At school in the '90s I carved my name into a desk using a mix of AC/DC & Iron Maiden lettering. Whole class got put in detention cos I wouldn't own up. My denial? Why would I carve my own name?
"I obviously don't like it when my kids are sick, but if there is a silver lining to be had, it's licking the spoon after giving them Calpol / Benylin."
"Often when I want rice with a meal, I'll go to my nearest Chinese restaurant and buy a quart of white rice, despite owning a rice cooker and always having rice on hand. I justify it to myself by saying I'm supporting a local business but I know in my heart that I'm just a lazyass"
"I've got a fake female profile on Facebook, it's from a 12 year old account and quite convincing, I regularly get creepy messages from men and I play along a little, then if they're in a relationship I screen shot the conversation to their partner. Everyone needs a hobby."
Housemate had a gross room with food wrappers & dirty plates. Told him he had to clean it to stop our mouse problem. He said the mice can't get into his room as its upstairs. I snuck into his room & tore up food wrappers so they looked chewed. He had a full temper tantrum clean
"When my cat was a kitten, he picked a fight with a crow. Big mistake. Now crows stalks him everywhere. This should really be his confession."
Every now and then I discretely cancel the microwave timer whenever any of my colleagues are away from the kitchen as their food is heating. Nothing against anyone it just brightens up the afternoon hearing about the 'microwave playing up again'
"Every Friday at 10am, I head to the meeting room I've booked for my weekly 2022 Budget Update meeting. There is no meeting, I set it up so I can do a Morrisons grocery shop via Amazon undisturbed."
"Due to a big book on my father's shelf called Gibbons: Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, as a child I thought one of history's greatest civilisations had been destroyed by primates."
"Every morning I give my 3 year old a bowl of dry cheerios. They sift through and pull out the biggest ones, there are some huge ones in there, and puts them in a neat pile. Asks me to put them in his collection for safe keeping. He hasn't got a collection. I eat them."
"I was once in a bar and on the counter they had picture frames full of counterfeit notes to show they couldn't be fooled by them. Anyway we robbed both of the frames, smashed them and paid the £60 taxi home using the demonstrative fake £20s."
"As a child I was curious as to what would happen if I swore on Club Penguin chat. Not wanting to risk my own account, I tested this on my Sister's account and got her banned."
I got bored of work and went and hid in the toilet and played candy crush for the rest of the day I had about 100 missed calls from people I worked with trying to tell me that my car was getting taken away for been illegally parked
"Worked in a small studio in the 00s doing spoken word and new age relaxation stuff. Client complained that the recording of a river he'd made sounded thin and blamed us. Leave it with us, mate. A few slowed down loops of me and the owner pissing were added. Happy customer."
"In a bid to save water, I sometimes wee in the sink. However, when my wife is nearby, I then have to flush the toilet to give reason as to why I'm in the bathroom. Thus I have a pissy sink and have wasted the water I planned on saving."
"I was struggling with my degree and panicking for my finals. They told us a question before the exam so I wrote all the answers on my legs and pretended I had a very poorly tummy. Each time my mind went blank, I asked to go to the loo. I ended up with a 2:1."

"I once found 40p in the work staff vending machine so I added 20p and bought a packet of crisps.Was eating them when somebody I worked with came in, having been to get the rest of their money for their own crisps. I never confessed that I stole their 40p to buy my packet"
"My husband suddenly moved out then dropped round & asked for a recipe he really loved & my dish to cook it. Next day I called round his. There were 2 champagne glasses on table, dish in oven, 'noises' from upstairs. I poured a whole box of salt in the dish & crept away."
"I genuinely used to think that the speed that the New Scotland Yard sign turned was dependent on the severity of the crimes taking place at that time. The worse the crimes, the faster it turned."
"Once or twice a month I'll buy something on Amazon purely so I can return it and get free credit, which I then spend on erotic fiction on my kindle. The transaction doesn't show, so my husband doesn't have a clue."
I got made redundant by a total arsewipe of a company and when I left I had to hand back my Apple Mac. Three years later I remotely wiped the whole damned unit and I don't feel a bit guilty.
"When I have a date with a new guy I suggest getting steak and order it well-done to see if he tries to tell me not to. If he does, I don't see him again - it's been a good asshole filter for years and I regret nothing."
Many years ago I'd usually be the first person to arrive at the office. I'd secretly put pin holes in the bottom of a few polystyrene drinking cups and then watch on in amusement as a random colleagues drink would slowly leak out onto their desk.
Accidentally made my morning cuppa with gravy granules. So much nicer. A hot cup of Bisto is far superior to Nescafe.
I'm a Mancunian that works in Car Insurance. If I get a Manc on the phone I'll always do whatever I can to help them. If I get a Scouser I do the opposite.
"My wife has trained long and hard for the marathon. She goes on long runs. She thinks I work hard at home whilst she's out. I play Xbox for nearly the whole time and track her on find my iPhone, making sure I'm cooking and hoovering when she's just about home."
"I've been with current wife since 1991, yet I still have to check how to spell her middle name. It's Rachael, but I just had to check that."
Talking to my boyfriend on Facetime. As a joke I send him the photo he sent me a while back of him bending over to show his asshole & balls. Call ends. Realise the most recent text chat - & therefore who I sent the photo to - was my boss. I quit out of embarrassment soon after
I got a toupee a while back after my wife learned about it in the news. She glues it on every few weeks and replaces it every few months. I look amazing and everyone thinks i look younger and better. Never going to tell anyone.
"I once found a wallet. It was nicer than mine, so I just swapped the contents of my wallet and theirs and handed it in. I still crack up thinking about the guy going to the police station and being like that's not my wallet and then seeing all of his stuff in it."
"My husband is so shit at his share of cleaning, that I went on strike. I was the only one who noticed."
"My mum has dementia and was getting very upset that she kept forgetting where she put her cigarette lighter. I bought 80 of them. They are now in every coat, draw and pocket. She's so happy when she says I remembered!. It makes me smile that she's happy"

"I sometimes find myself watching old TV comedy shows online - Rising Damp, The Brittas Empire etc but not because I like them so much but because they remind me of how my father used to howl with laughter at them. He died 16 years ago."
"I'm going on holiday next week, and the thing I'm most excited about is that my housemate might finally realise how much I clean the kitchen"
"Two tradesmen got in to their van and proceeded to throw their Greggs' rubbish out of the window. That night, I spent three hours writing bad reviews about their business on as many review sites as I could find."
"My ex girlfriend, used to and probably still does keep all of her used sanitary products, I found this out while I was moving her stuff into my home! She says it's normal, I said it was a deal breaker and ended the relationship."
My brother stole my hair wax so I scooped it out and filled it with lard my dad bought to make bird food with in winter. Brother walked around for 3 weeks with a head dripping in lard.
"I just dropped a box of Weetabix to the floor in Morrisons. No-one was looking, so I swapped it with another box so someone else gets the crumbly smashed one."
"I am burning books. Lots of them. I've got too many and tried to give them away but charities don't want them and most are only worth like £3-4 including postage if I sell them. Fuel prices are high and the house is cold. Reader, I am burning the books"
"The other half thinks I'm getting fit for health reasons as I'm getting older. Truth is, my school reunion is coming up, and I want to see if any of my old crushes will fancy me now that I've gotten into better shape."
When I was little I made a wish to be a Labrador puppy. After noticing blonde hairs on my arms I thought it was coming true and cried myself to sleep for several nights thinking about how cross my mum and dad would be.
I once worked at a very cool social media agency that prided itself on having a slide and a ball pool in the middle of the office. On my first day someone told me that the owners dog had just had a shit in the ball pool and in hindsight it was a perfect metaphor for the business.
"Rather than engage in an argument with my wife, when she asks 'what's the matter?' I just politely answer 'nothing at all' and write down my issue with her in a word doc. It is currently 18 pages long."
Poking chunks of tartar from between your teeth with a paperclip and crunching the stinky stoney-chalky nuggets is even more satisfying than squeezing the goup from blackheads or whiteheads on the nose.
"When packing for holiday as a child, my mum used to make me take one pair of pants per day with an extra 'emergency' pair in case I had an accident. "
I still do this now. I'm 42.
I've been secretly sexting a man twice my age and it's hot af except his spelling is terrible: he said he was going to take me to narnia. I think he meant nirvana.
All my bank login details are based on the combination that came with for a plastic safe full of bubblegum I got when I was six.
"Sometimes when I see my postman approaching, I crouch by the letterbox, snatch the letters as they are posted and bark like an angry dog. I don't have a dog and I'm pretty sure my postman knows that. I'm 50."

"When I was 7 woke up in the night and tried to put the lights on but nothing happened, I still couldn't see anything, panicked and ran into my mum's room screaming because I thought I'd gone blind. There'd been a power cut."
"When I take a dump I always say Anal sausage! in a small, constipated voice. I'm 55 years old."
"I wake up twice a night for a piss. I learnt long ago that if I use the toilet in the dark, 50% will end up on the floor. However, if I use the sink I never miss. Needless to say I have given up the toilet a long time ago."
When I first met my girlfriend I told her I was an orphan to get a sympathy shag. It worked and we've been together for 6 months. My Mum really wants to meet her now.
During lockdown i went for a park date with a woman and her dog. I embraced the dog and said 'hello sexy' instead of 'hello gorgeous'. It was a very quiet walk.
"I bought my niece a cute 1st birthday card with loads of bees on the front, turns out it was a joke about Boo-Bees…I bought my 1 year old niece a card about tits."
I pass my ex-husband's office everyday. There is a queue of cars trying to get out. I never let anyone get out as punishment to him. Ridiculous? Yes. Immature? Absolutely and I love it
"My husband is having an affair. While biding my time to leave, I occasionally sneak one of his socks or underpants into the bin and take great pleasure in thanking him for taking it out on bin nights."
I am 54 and recently had chest pains. I went to A&E and had an ECG. All clear. Had a conversation with the senior nurse to try and ascertain what the cause may have been. We concluded that I had probably eaten too much cheese.
"Sorry my dear, lovely, naive wife. I wasn't dreaming of strumming a guitar in the middle of the night as you assumed. I was having a wank."
"Sometimes I don't take my phone to the toilet, and for old time's sake read the ingredients on bleach or toothpaste instead."
Whenever I'm working on a Word or Excel document and have to copy an item I say out loud 'Copy that' in the style of CapCom at NASA when they are advising that famous astronaut Tom Hanks on how to save Apollo 13.
As an awkward teenager in the 90's I was so desperate to be seen as cool that I gave myself an eyebrow slit with my fathers beard trimmer. Having miscalculated how much to remove I then proceeded to super glue more hair over the now missing eyebrow. Lessons were learnt.
In John Lewis car park in Kingston upon Thames someone parked so close to my drivers side I had to get my son into his baby seat from the wrong side then crawl over myself. With a 50p I left a gouge so deep all along the side of the other car.

"Whilst working as a paper boy in the 90s, we regularly lifted a few porn mags and slipped them into the delivery papers. No one ever complained and our Xmas tips increased massively"
I've been with the love of my life for 23 years. Sometimes I feel like our relationship has become a public institution which stands for wonderful things that I no longer believe in.

"When driving, I often flash my lights at motorists on the other side to let them know the police are up ahead. The police are never up ahead but it's amusing to think of them driving extra slowly in a paranoid state for the next mile or so."
I suck used tea bags dry while no ones looking the flavour is so rich
"As a 19 year old student, I was picked up by a cougar in a bar. At hers, I panicked when I noticed her husband in the corner recording us and called a cab. Sat waiting for it, I decided I needed a momento, and ended up going home with a CD copy of James Taylor' greatest hits."
"I was once going down on my boyfriend when his moans became increasingly louder and he started tapping me on the head. Pleased that my performance was clearly hitting the spot, I went hell for leather only for him to pee in my mouth. Turns out he just needed the loo."
I faked my ex husband's signature on our divorce papers. Couldn't find the fat twat and wanted to get rid of him.
I recently got some tattoos but I don't want my parents to know and had to sweat through a dinner last week as I was wearing a jumper and couldn't take it off. I'm 42.
Got caught short at my new boyfriend's place but he was in the shower so I shat in his kitchen bin. I broke up with him while we were out that night just so I wouldn't have to face the music. Sorry Daniel you were actually quite nice
"I'm a private tutor and one day one of my students, 7, showed me his new Lego remote-controlled buggy. I, 36, was so envious that I went home and sheepishly asked my wife if I could buy some Lego. She said yes, I bought the exact same set, and I couldn't be happier."
As a child we discovered that if you turned the knob very carefully on the 6d chocolate machine at the bottom of the road you'd get an extra turn after the third paid for bar. So we'd get 4 bars for 1/6 instead of 2/-.
I like to walk near oblivious people lost in their phone just to initiate the shock flinch when they nearly collide with you.
My wife booked me a doctor's appointment due to my ever-increasing waistline. I secretly cancelled it the day before and instead spent 30 mins in McDonalds eating 2 bacon double cheeseburgers and told my wife the doctor said I'm healthy as a horse. Third time I've done that.
I worked for a London adverting agency for many years and had to do self-assessment tax returns even though I was on PAYE. I would take two sick days every year to do this. Why on earth would anyone expect you do it for nothing?
I'm so greedy that sometimes if we order takeaway I'll add extra sides and then pretend to my wife that the restaurant gave them for free or that the app 'must have broken'.

"I met a girl on a night out, went back to her place & fucked. When finished she broke down & told me she had cancer. Told her I was going the toilet but lied & ran home. I felt guilty often wondering if she had died, then a few years later I saw her at train station, she made it"

For years my Nan wondered what had happened to her VHS copy of Princess Diana's funeral. I didn't have the heart to tell her I taped over it when I was short of a tape for the Doctor Who omnibus on UK Gold. I wasn't missing Earthshock.

"I've developed a habit of visiting the Twitter page of porn stars. Not because I want to watch porn, but so I can stalk the profiles of the weird men who reply to every tweet. It's fascinating and awful watching 58 year old Dave from Barnsley trying to pull some 22 y/o stunner."
"When I worked in retail - the worst years of my life - I kept a tiny magnet at the cash register. If a customer was a jerk, I would de-magnetize their bank cards. I did it a lot."
"If you leave your desk for an hour, people question where you are. If you leave your desk for an hour with your laptop and a notepad, no questions are asked. I've been taking my laptop and notepad to the toilet and having some me time at least three times a week."

When my dog misbehaves I whisper into his ear that he is adopted
"I hate kids. If there's a particularly annoying one when I'm out shopping, I'll sneak chocolate, sweets and similar items into their parents trolley so the annoying little shitbag gets a bollocking from their parents at the checkout for trying to be sneaky."
My 2 yr old regularly bursts in while I'm taking a piss and always asks  daddy why are you weeing through your finger? Thanks mate for reiterating how small my cock is every other day
"I have an interview for a lucrative, exciting new job in two days time. Instead of preparing, I'm sat on the sofa doom scrolling Twitter. I'm not sure if it's self sabotage, arrogance or plain laziness."
"I used to own my own business and during consultation with customers used to ask If they liked football. I would ask which team they followed, if the reply was Man Utd I would joke that the price had just gone up 10%, we would all laugh, but I would actually add 10%."
"I've spent years convincing everyone I'm really forgetful when in fact I just hate socialising, so now whenever there's an occasion as long as no one reminds me on the day I claim I forgot, they all say what are you like and we move on."
"I was 7 and my sister 3: she burnt herself on a light in the night. I was a hero for rushing her to the sink, putting hand under cold water. Actually I hated her-it was me that put her chubby little sleeping fingers on the bulb. I felt so bad I've been nice to her for 30 years."
"My penis seems to be shrinking badly, I need to take Viagra before getting in the shower with my rugby mates, as I would be too embarrassed to show it normally"
"I regularly go into Greggs for breakfast. I despise the human sputum that congregate in these places and regularly sneer at these lowlifes as I enjoy my morning coffee. However, I recently clocked myself in the window's reflection on the way out and realised I am I one of them."
My husband has been arguing with people on the internet for years. Recently I have been able to see some of his posts - and he's not the debating genius he's been claiming he is. At all. I'm quite embarrassed to be married to him now.
"Husband is a dick, turns everything into a battle he has to win. Word games are his bag including wordle which we both do every day. Ive never really played it, but simply get the answer each day online to make sure I beat him by at least one turn. It's driving him mental."
"When I was saying bye to a guy I'd just slept with, I patted his willy and said thank you. I have no idea why, and I self implode with cringe everytime I think about it."

In the early 90s after a night out me and my mates would play a game of Dial-a-Manc. We would dial 0161 then a random 7 numbers & ask them about a car or washing machine they'd advertised in the paper. Much confusion on the other end. Childish but very funny at the time.
"I had a friend who was always coming around and asking for cups of tea. Not the the normal 1 or 2 cups, but cup after cup. I got annoyed "
"and bought a huge box of Happy Shopper tea and I'd secretly make his tea with the cheap, rank tasting bags whilst we all had Yorkshire."
I've been listening to punk and new wave music over the past 40 years. I've only noticed that the emphasis on the second syllable on Vacant on the Sex Pistols song Pretty Vacant makes it sound rude.
I'm a married woman but only masturbate to gay male porn. I think its something to do with the lack of OTT female actor orgasms. Plus 2 dicks better than one.
"My ex broke up with me about a month before the finale of his favorite Netflix show hit. He'd organized a viewing party ready for midnight when it dropped. I let him stayed signed in on my account until 11:59PM that day, when I changed the password & forced logout on all devices."
"I deliberately make my husband a nice big drink before bed. That way I know he's going to get up in the night for a wee, and will also let the dog out for a wee. I stay in bed comfy and warm."
"When in the shower, I use my pubes as a kind of loofah, to get the shower gel to foam up, then apply the foam to the rest of my body."
"When I proposed to my now wife took her for a fancy meal but realised I'd lost my wallet when looking for ring, so to save my embarrassment I set the fire alarm off, and managed to leave without paying."
I don't really understand Rugby at all. But I always tell the wife I want to watch the 6 nations because she takes the kids out. I then get to sit by myself in front of the TV not having a fecking clue whats going on drinking beers. Pure bliss
"I was seeing a girl for a year and went to her grandfather's funeral and had an accident, I cleaned up and I panicked and needed rid of the evidence. It was an open casket, I feel guilty as he's buried with my shit-caked boxers for eternity."
My boyfriend thinks I masturbate in the bathtub. But really I just play crossword puzzles on my phone.
"My wife often eats half a pizza but forgets to put it away before she heads to bed. As a cheeky payment for putting it away for her, I always slice off a thin strip of pizza along the cut edge & eat it on the way to bed. The perfect crime, she'll never know."
"When it rains, I deliberately walk around with my shoelaces untied so that I can pretend to be tieing them when I'm really rescuing worms, but am too embarrassed to admit it."
"When working in a bank call centre, if customers were rude, I would keep their account loaded on my screen after the call and repeatedly enter false passcodes so it disabled their online and telephone banking. It took 5 days for them to be sent a reset code to their home address."
I once read the whole of The Vampire Lestat in one sitting. When I woke up the next morning I was afraid to open the curtains in case I disintegrated in the sunlight.

"I went out with a guy for a few months, but couldn't work out how to pronounce his name. We met online, and he never said it out loud. I should have asked him, but I felt I'd left it too long and it would be weird, so I broke up with him. I still can't figure out how to say it."
"Since hearing a couple of female colleagues talking about men with small willies don't joke about small willies, I've started joking about small willies"
I used to add on a few thousand points to my game high scores when sending them into Crash magazine and I never got arrested
My wife gives the worst handjobs. It feels like she's going to pull my dick off. But I can't think of a way to tactfully address this. We've been together fifteen years. My poor penis.
"When I'm in a shopping centre I'll pick someone up ahead of me as my opponent for a walking race. They're obviously oblivious but sometimes once I overtake at an unnecessary pace they speed up too. But they have no chance, the afterburners go on and I'm gone. Victorious."
When I was in primary school I kept doggy chocolate buttons in my coat pocket to give out to the other children by telling them they were regular chocolate buttons.
"Working in the hospital, I told the wrong relative her mom had died. Mortified is not even close to it. But they were so happy in the end."
If I want to put off a man on a dating site then I just repeatedly complain about my job. Seems nicer than ghosting them and works a treat.
If I'm not happy with the hotel I'm staying in I'll leave taps running and heating on to get my 'moneys worth'. If it's massively shit I'll even steal the batteries out the remotes.
"My daughter Lily's piano teacher misheard her name when she first started lessons, and we didn't correct her at the time. Now it's gone on so long we're both too embarrassed to tell her. So, next month, Milly will be giving her first ever piano recital."
"I have been a professional copywriter for nearly 15 years. I know what verbs and nouns are but I couldn't tell you what an adverb, adjective, conjunction or preposition is. Not much point learning this now."
"Other than my own, I only remember my ex boss' mobile number. When someone chats me up and asks for my number I always give them his. Sorry Jim."
"My gf has small boobs. I love her more than words, but knowing I'll never fondle big boobs again makes me a bit sad. She probably feels the same about my cock."
I made another profile on our Netflix called Mum that I use to finish films and series when my girlfriend goes to bed early. I then continue watching it with her when she's awake and pretend I don't know what's happening.
One of the vitamin pills I take looks exactly like the speckled Es I used to drop in my raving days. Each morning I glance both ways to 'check for bouncers' before hastily chucking it down my neck & slugging a glass of water. It reminds me of a more carefree time.

"One time, I was so hungover that after withdrawing some cash at a cash point I said thank you out loud to the machine with a cue of 6 people behind me all hearing."
"After my first ever one night stand, the guy I shagged told me his favourite film was The Iron Lady and that he idolised Thatcher for saving the world and I haven't stopped scrubbing myself clean ever since."
I once had a shitty housemate he made my life hell. So when I moved out I waited a while. Bought 100 keys and 100 key labels the ones you can write on labelled his number and left all over the city. I couldn't be there to witness the pain but I felt the joy in my soul.
Was late for a train and this old man was just ambling down the corridor at my work. Pushed past him muttering silly old sod. Then noticed a film crew at the end of the corridor filming a bemused Melvyn Bragg I'd just shoved out of the way
"Whenever I see a social media 'influencer' is on 'holiday' somewhere, I find myself stalking their profile until they post about being back home in England. I can't settle until they're back in the cold and the rain like the rest of us. Entitled pricks."
Upon noticing a change of surname I congratulated my colleague on her recent marriage. Turns out she'd just got divorced.
"I'm a train driver. When we see staff working on the tracks we are trained to blast our horn at them and they have to raise their hand to acknowledge. Whenever this occurs I shout in the cabin put your hands up if your missus doesn't suck your dick, it's my daily treat."
I booked a man with van for moving flat. He neglected to turn up on the day.I rang from a friend's number and sent him on an imaginary 120 mile trip to shift some imaginary boxes for an imaginary elderly country gent for an imaginary £300.
"Whenever someone in the office offers to go and buy us all a coffee, I always insist on going. I don't want them knowing I order a hot chocolate."
"When my son was 5yrs I was running a bath for him. A sales call came through. I said my son is in the bathroom, sorry I have to go. The sales person said of course. It was the quickest I have wriggled out of any sales call. My son is now 13 yrs"
"old, I still use that line."
"I once saw a discarded Krispy Kreme box in the street. I ripped off the bit with the Smiles reward code and added it to my own balance, giving me enough points to get a free box of 3 donuts."
"I have an open relationship with my wife. I tell her I'm going on a date with a cute girl, but really I just head to a random pub and read Tom Clancy novels."
"I used the text replacement feature on my husband's iPhone to change 'your' to 'you're'. It drives him mad, and he often sends messages to people without noticing that it has autocorrected. Every time he sends me the wrong spelling, I take great delight in correcting him."
"I have just disinherited my son because I found out he's subscribed to Kerry Katona's Only Fans account. All the cash, the house, etc, going to the RSPCA. And I'm leaving my body to medical science."
"Yesterday when bemoaning her latest failed relationship, my attractive 30-year-old intern squeezed my arm and said God I wish I could clone you. I'm a chubby bloke in his 50s and very loyal to my wife, but that arm squeeze has gone right into the spank bank."
"I once pretended to be a professional darts player at my local, they believed me for 3 years. I got hammered once and finally played a game of around the board. Didn't hit a double to start the game. I never went back there again!"

"I just detached an abnormally long pube from my sack. It was so long I think I must have had it since I was a teenager, which means it was over 20 years old. I gave it a Viking burial down the toilet pan. Farewell, old pal. You've seen a lot."
"Each month at work, I turn the crap modern art paintings 90 degrees clockwise. Nobody has ever noticed."
"When I'm entering my PIN, I pretend to enter other numbers on the off chance someone's got a camera on me so they can't steal my PIN number. Doing little feints like I'm the Messi of the chip and PIN world."
I haven't had a wank since my mum passed away last June. I'm scared her ghost will catch me cracking one off
"There was a new guy in my office that really got on my nerves, one day he asked me to set an out of office for him so I wrote 'thank you for your email, I'm currently on anal leave' knowing he was useless and would never check it."
I used to keep a woolly hat under my bed for wank purposes until once I put my hand under to grab and it was gone. The next day my younger brother came back from school with it on his head.I suppose it was mostly clean on the outside anyway.
"In 1981 I stole the cassette version of UB40's Present Arms album from Littlewoods in Lincoln. Felt so bad I sent it back to them by post with an anonymous note telling them to up their security. Next time I went in, all the cassette boxes were empty."
I have binge eating disorder - Mrs didn't know. In 2020 she bought loads of easter eggs to take home to family at Easter. I'd routinely eat them all & secretly replace them. Then covid hit & I couldn't get to the shops. Such shame in having to say where 12 Dairy Milk eggs went
"Pre mobiles, I met a girl on holiday. We planned to meet in UK at an M3 service station midway between us. I waited but she never showed. When leaving I realised that she might have been in the mirror image service station on the other side of the road. Regret it to this day."
"I like to use the prepaid envelopes from junk mail to send the company other 'interesting' mail I receive, I have just sent a Screwfix catalogue to a PPI claim company."
I'm starting to think my partner cares more about their online presence than me. It honestly kills me inside.
"When I'm sitting on the can, I use the Nest security cams to make sure no-one's about to ring the doorbell. Peace of mind."
"I gave up wanking in the shower after learning about super sperm at school and how long they can live 'outside' the balls, I was terrified they'd live in the bath and Impregnate my Mum when she had a bath"
"My dog is having his knackers off next week. Unbeknownst to my wife, I have done several photoshoots of him with his coin purse featuring in every shot. He has a cracking pair and it's a real shame they have to go."
"A good few years ago, when pagers were still a common thing, I regularly used to send messages to a colleague's pager reading low battery. It used to drive her mad, especially when she'd just replaced them after the previous time."
If I'm driving past a golf course while somebody's lining up a shot I will honk my horn when it looks like they're taking the swing. Hilarious every time

"I am straight. I went to a gay man to have my back waxed. Once he'd done that, he suggested doing my chest hair, then wet-shaving my junk. There was A LOT of unneccessary handling, and I got a raging hard-on. We didn't mention it. I'd probably go back."
I only learnt to tie my shoelaces properly at the age of 47 by watching YouTube videos.
I once worked for a Council Planning Department. To amuse myself I went into the Tree Officer's Word settings and set up autocorrect to turn every tree name he typed into a swear word. He only noticed when the complaints started rolling in
"As a former Tesco till worker, I used to reprint all receipts where a customer didn't use their Clubcard and load the potential points onto mine. I was racking up an easy £10 each week and it's amazing I never got caught"
"The wife has set me an exercise target, if I do 30k a month she rewards me with a BJ. I've started attaching my smart watch to the dog's collar and letting him runaround the garden until I've achieved the distance."
"I drive trains for a living. At some stations there are spots on the platform so people know where the doors will be when we stop. When I'm bored I deliberate creep along the platform and stop a few metres out of place, just to watch commuters sidle up the platform like crabs."
I'm a viewing agent which I hate. We're currently marketing a derelict care home which has a piano in situ where the lounge used to be. I regularly make up viewings just so I can go there and learn to play the piano. I'll be gutted when it sells.
"My entire family think I have a degree even though I dropped out before finishing it. Told them I graduated as I couldn't bring myself to tell them otherwise. I even got gifts for it. In too deep now, no going back"
"The longer I do my job, the more I relate to the woman that used to work here and hid her work in the ceiling when she couldn't be arsed to do it... We all knew in the department but everywhere else just fell for her sweet little lies"
"I had a dream last night about a great new podcast. I remember writing it in the dream, then woke to right it down for the morning, then went back to sleep. Woke up this morning to see what amazing idea I had: Paranormal Rice."
"Working from home, I've taken to saying aloud various actions as I do them e.g. Control C , sent items, hit search. I'm a bit worried I'll keep doing it as/when I go back to the office..."
At the age of 38 I discovered that the word 'segue' was not spelt 'segway' and that the word 'segue' was not pronounced 'seeg.' I have a PhD.
"A guy at work annoyed me to my core. Took revenge by posting an add with his mobile number on GumTree advertising a Fee African Grey Parrot, due to immediate relocation with work. The guy had around 100 calls in a single day and answered all of them as he worked in sales."
"Took my mates phone when he was drunk and changed his wife's number to mine so we could see his face when we sent him rude messages in the pub. Later, he fell asleep on the train and I woke up to 30 increasingly angry messages asking her to come and pick him up"
"I keep a diary/record of how often me and my partner have sex. I make a note of time of day and whether we've been drinking. It's becoming much more infrequent and mainly after alcohol. I would say something, but I don't want them to know about the diary."
"I've recently joined a new company, where everybody else is a heavy drinker. I stopped drinking years ago, so this means I get very quiet mornings to myself whilst everybody else recovers, and my lack of productivity doesn't stand out. Win win."

"I went on a first date with a girl with a girl I was talking to for a while online and we had a lot in common. When she turned up, she was doused in Chanel no5, the same brand my 60+ year old mum has been wearing for years. I've 'ghosted' her since because it was too off putting"
"For years I told my children that I went to school with Barry Scott of Cillit Bang fame. Even fabricated Christmas cards. They saw no reason to question this. Wish he was on Cameo, would be the perfect ending."
I have a recurring sex dream about Elton John and I'm not sure why as I am a gay woman
"Quite often, when I and my partner have sex, I put four candles on the headboard of the bed. Not just to enjoy her beauty but also in tribute to the Two Ronnies sketch."
I hate my nosey parker landlord so when Storm Eunice hit I kicked the fence down and let the weather take the wrap. Hope it cost £££ to repair.
"I worked in a CD manufacturing plant in the hols. Mostly total music crap but the 2nd Oasis CD - What's the Story - came in to be printed before release. I smuggled the master copy out in my pants, copied it onto cassette and all my friends got prerelease copies. I was a hero."
When I cook a ready meal I don't stir it half way through its cooking time as per the instructions.
I was drinking mint tea for four years before I learned it's unusual to add milk
My dad's confession really but... In the 80s we lived next door to a pet shop that put a parrot in a cage at the front of the shop. My dad would walk past with his dogs and say piss off to it at least eight times a day. The shop had to retire the parrot for swearing at people.
My daughters school has a no chocolate policy. When she stays with me I always put 3 or 4 Smarties loose in her lunchbox. The thought of her excited little face furtively eating Smarties before her teachers see makes my heart burst
"Debagged my little brother in the local pool by stealth swimming underwater, yanking them off and waving them gleefully in his face. Except it wasn't my brother, it was another kid with the same shorts. He was livid, chased me round the pool 3 times while my brother creased."
"FROM ADMIN: I'm (@robmanuel) reading all your confessions again, as I do every day. They're fascinating, horrible and funny, & it takes a huge amount of my time. If you fancy throwing me coins for my efforts it would make me happy but it's up to you. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"I am writing a novel in which the husband is a total prick. He's entirely based on my own husband. My husband doesn't know this. I am confident that when it's published, he won't clock that it's him."
"For three years I worked at a cinema as an usher and it was profoundly tedious work. The only thing that motivated me was the chance to dutifully say to every visiting patron the word cinema incorrectly when directing them, Up there to your left you'll find Cimena 3."
I had a big falling out with a former friend who is an author. When I go into a bookshop I look for her books and hide them.
"When my marriage was going poorly and we were going to bed hours apart, I'd wait til everyone was definitely asleep and then watch a bit of internet porn on my phone for ages and then masturbate into the kitchen bin in complete darkness"
"I was having a meal at my girlfriends parents and they were having mushrooms. I hate mushrooms but rather than say that I said I was allergic to them. 25 years on and I'm married to said girlfriend and my wife, children, family, friends all believe in my 'mushroom allergy'"

"At university, I rearranged the floor numbers in the block of flats I lived in. For months I watched other students ride the lift to the floor they wanted, step out, see a number they weren't expecting, and then get back into the lift and randomly try another floor."
I've always thought that London weighting was an expression for the amount of time that you had to spend waiting for public transport if you worked in London. Only when I saw the spelling recently did I realise how wrong I was.
"I hired a cleaner after my partner refused to help and now, every Friday night my partner treats me to takeaway and flowers for cleaning the house. A year later I'm starting to feel slightly guilty. Is it too late to fess up?"
My dad was a vicar and his most beloved possession is a vial of water from some well in the Bible. As a kid I didn't want my cat to go to hell so I used the vial of water to baptise him then replaced it with tap water. Dad cherishes the vial of tap water to this day.
"I used to play piano at weddings, which meant I spent most weekends working.I'd always set up in a corner and watch football on my phone all afternoon whilst playing, pretending to look at my music whilst the married couple were enjoying their special day."
I'm 50 and I've seen close to two hundred bands live at concerts and festivals over the years. 
But nothing comes close to the feeling of excitement at seeing Stefan Dennis doing a PA at Flix nightclub in Brechin in the late 80s.
I arrange all the insurance and household bills in my house. My partner thinks I'm just really good and organised when really I do it through a cash back site and have earned a secret £450 in a year.
"My husband started an Open University degree last year. He asked me to check his essay. Turns out he can't think critically or write sentences. 6 months later, he's on track for a 1st. Bless him, he doesn't even get that this is cheating."
I bunked off college to sneak home & knock one out to a porn vid. One day the VHS player chewed up the tape and wouldn't budge. Rather than admit to my parents what I'd done I dumped the VHS & staged a burglary. Came home to find mum in tears & scenes of crime dusting for prints.
"Bored with my mid 30s boring middle class life, whenever I open a bottle of red wine I stamp the cork on my wrist and reminisce about the days I used to go clubbing"
My pet-owning friends all think I'm some kind of Cat-Whisperer because seconds after meeting a cat I have it licking my fingers. The secret is a quick scratch of my sweaty arse crack when no-one is looking. Cats can't get enough of it.
"My wife wanted a threesome, with another man. I found a bloke online, we all met, hit it off and had several sessions. She begged me to allow her to play solo, and I agreed. 6 months on, he's living in my house, she pregnant with his kid and I'm in a bed sit."
I have absolutely no sense of direction. When using google maps I just have to start walking to see if my 'dot' is going in the right direction. Sometimes this takes more than 4 attempts as I can't remember the streets I've already tried.
I park the forklifts at work next to one another at the weekend so they don't get lonely
My dad was a music journalist. He tape recorded an interview with Bob Marley in the 1970s. My dad was offered thousands of pounds for the recording in recent years. I don't have the heart to tell him I recorded over it with 'Tour de France' by Kraftwerk.
"In order to gain the requisite courage at the urinal, I stand with my left hand on my hip and sing I'm a little teapot in my head."

"After eating, I sometimes wipe my hands on the dog."
I feel low level shame and embarsement when MS Word can't even work out what word I've tried to spell
"I'd really like to try a threesome, but even if my wife did agree, I suspect I would have no idea what to do in the situation and would probably end up in the kitchen eating a sandwich."
"Whenever I share a packet of chocolate with my wife I am petty and insist we have separate bowls, to ensure a equal split. I always eat a couple of her pieces beforehand."
"I was recently at head office for the first time in a while and took great pleasure in noting that while some had remained svelte, in common with me many of my colleagues have almost comically ballooned during covid. We look like fat-suit-wearing versions of our former selves."
"I love my boyfriend of 10 years but I absolutely despise his laugh. It's gotten to a point in which I avoid anything remotely funny around him in the hopes I don't have to hear it. Can't tell him as it would break his heart, the sensitive horrible laughing bastard"
"I'm in love with the boy who lives in the flat below mine, and have been for 4 years. We finally slept together a couple of months ago. I've hardly heard from him since. Secretly I'm even hoping for the 'hey, you up?' text. Plus, now I have to do my make up to put the bins out"
"My cat went missing a month ago, he was found and we buried him two weeks ago. Today he came through the window, I'm not sure whose cat I have under my rose bush in the garden, but I'm glad Timothy is back."
"I often pee on my plants because, I can't be bothered watering them. They're doing really well."
I once sold the 'display crab' by accident to a customer from a fresh fish counter. It was at least week old and had been re-frozen every night. I hope I didn't kill someone.
"Staying at a friends' house I slept on the floor while he and his girlfriend were in the bed. Woke up in the night to hear her tossing him off while whispering the dirtiest, filthiest words of encouragement. Never been more jealous of someone in my life."
"I was in a rough area of town, and saw a homeless person standing outside of a store with a coffee cup with no lid. I stopped, put my spare change in and was horrified when it made a glunk sound. I had just put coins into a person's drink."
I'm 28 and have just discovered that if you move side to side when having a piss you can create both a Mexican wave of piss and a tsunami like effect in the toilet water. I'm not saying try it but try it.
Fixed my mums IPad and linked hers and mine together somehow. Everything I did appeared in her IPad. The final straw when I was watching some piss porn - she had to ring me and asked me to stop as it was getting too much - very bad times.
Years ago I worked a day on a phone sex line. We were given the real estate ads from papers so we could pretend the houses were ours and we could make 'dates' there- just to prolong the pay per minute conversations. The potential harm from this horrified me and I never went back.
My GP thinks that giving extra prune juice cured my son's constipation. It's really by introducing him to Mr Hankey on Southpark. He now thinks pooing is hilarious and is no longer scared. Just have to stop him shouting he wants to do a Mr Hankey poo loudly in the supermarket.

"On World Book Day, I used to send my boys to school dressed as knights with homemade swords and maces. If the teachers were going to force me to make or buy costumes for them, they would have to deal with the consequences of having armed children roaming the school."
"My mother and father used to sit it their regular corner at the pub every week until they passed away. I placed a handful of each their ashes in between their seats. It's a listed building so alteration are unlikely, and they will be 'drinking' there for many years to come."
I once sent an anonymous valentine to a guy I worked with. He called the police as he thought a member of the public was stalking him. I went off him after that.
"Had a hot date, so ate a tonne of watermelon beforehand as I'd read it helps you get super hard. Ended up having to cut the evening short because it went right through me & I couldn't stop shitting."
"FROM ADMIN: If we did a @fesshole readers’ survey, what woull be some good questions to ask?"
Everything meaningful I've ever achieved in any of my jobs happened while I really should have been getting on with something else
I'm obsessed with Michael Gove's teeth. Every time he appears in the news I go on Google Images and search for them. The ones where you can see loads of yellow tartar are the best.
My dad's can of shaving foam ran out after just a couple of days. He tried to return it and got into an argument in the shop. He was so annoyed that on the way home he crashed the car. He never knew I'd emptied it during an experimental pubescent wanking session. Sorry Dad.
"In the supermarket, I will loudly say things like 'without DNA they can't prove anything' to my wife as we walk past people. The looks are priceless, give it a try some time."
Was in a trendy restaurant where they had a Jenga tower in the middle of the table. Replaced one of the jenga blocks with an undercooked oblong potato chip as food was shit and way overpriced
I used the staff taxi account of the theatre I used to work at for three years after I left.
While working at the Co-op I used to hide a few of the very best easter eggs behind the toilet roll - then dig them out after Easter where I could get them for pennies at a discount.
"Schedule Send on email is a great invention. I type up emails during the day and schedule them to be sent in the evening to make clients think I'm working really hard for them. I'm not, I'm at home watching tv"
When we were together my ex linked his digital calendar to my phone. We've been apart 4 years and not spoken for 8 months. I've given up trying to un-link myself. Now I just enjoy seeing what he's up to and hoping he's well
"My best mate from school is 32 and hasn't changed since he was 14. Lives with his mum, barely works, spends his time getting high and playing Xbox. He seems happy. I'm more than a little jealous."
I set up a complaint box at work. People think HR set it up but it was me. At the end of every week I take the box home and read about all this petty drama that's been built up.
I once ate my wife's advent calendar when cravings kicked in one night. Blamed it on the dog. She insisted we took the dog to the vets to get checked out. Went along with it rather than coming clean and the vet bill came to £150. Worth it.

"I hate my neighbour that much that every few weeks, at night, I move their satellite dish. It fills me with joy when the have to call the SkY engineer to realign at £50 a time."
"When visiting New York the wife and I had a routine each night when we ate out, I'd 'propose' to her and she'd tearfully accept, Americans being Americans would woop and cheer and occasionally the restaurant let us eat for free. We'd been married 8 years."
"I once dropped a brand new, full jar of Biscoff spread and it shattered into tiny pieces, held together by its glorious contents. I wept for a moment, then spent the next few hours crouched on the floor, carefully spooning out the middle so as not to face throwing it in the bin."
"One Xmas I decided to get my girlfriend jewellery and so I got her a necklace and a ring. She opened the ring , burst into tears, said yes and phoned her parents to say we're engaged. I couldn't break her heart . Been unintentionally married for 10 years."
"Whenever I clean the fluff out of the tumble-dryer filter, I throw it into the garden and tell my wife that birds use it to insulate their nests. I have no idea if this is true, I'm just too lazy to take it to the bin."
Was given a voucher for a restaurant for £25. Took a date to that restaurant and we shared a deal for £30. Date wasn't the best. I suggested we split the bill and went to the bar to pay. Pocketed £10 from her and used the voucher plus £5 to pay. I made a cash profit on a d...
"As a bus driver, I like to play a game called 'pass or pensioner'. When an OAP scans their bus pass, the expiry date comes up on the ticket machine screen. I like to decide which I think will expire first, the pass or the pensioner."
"The peak of my boredom during lockdown, which to be honest I'm still an avid fan of in 2022, is Google Street Viewing bakeries in Colombia and seeing which of their pastries I'd most like to try. I have no links to South America and live in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England."
My boss was pissing me off so I downloaded their CV from LinkedIn and sent it to a ton of recruiters. That boss left within the week.
"I'm in my mid 40s, love watching the football and boxing but recently I've become addicted to The Archers, I fuckin love it. I've hidden it from my family as they will probably think I've had a breakdown."
I hooked up with an ex only to find out mid-sex that his biggest turn on was to stare at himself in the mirror during sex. Never went back again.
I regularly stalk my husbands ex-girlfriend on Facebook just to check she's still got wonky boobs and dating a bloke who looks old enough to be her Dad. We've been married ten years but still makes me feel better seeing her looking ropey.
I wish my husband would give me as much time as attention as he does Duolingo. I resent that cute bloody owl. I'm multilingual and can make cute little da-ding sounds pressed in the right way.
"I decided to take a flight using some crutches I no longer needed - and rebandaged my now healthy foot - hoping the airline would upgrade me for more legroom. They didn't. But I was too embarrassed to stop pretending, so went from Thailand to London with a fake limp."
My husband has started a football podcast with his friends and thinks he is now a celebrity. It's awful. I cringe every time.
"In '93 at school, I painstakingly spent weeks carving the Rage Against The Machine typewriter font logo into a desk. Dead chuffed, I only realized I'd spelt 'against' as 'agianst' when someone else carved 'you dyslexic bastard' underneath."

"My mate worked in a 24hr petrol station. I used sit and keep him company. On late Saturday nights, we would slide all the porno mags neatly into the middle of the Mail On Sundays."
"95% of my followers are straight men who want to shag me, little do they know, I'm a man who has put my photo through a gender change FaceApp. Sorry guys."
"One of the best things about my husband is he likes the same bubble baths I do. None of this sea sage, clay musk manly blue & green bath smellies for him. So tonight we both smell of vanilla sugar & moonberries."
"When I'm doing the laundry I always assure my wife that I've done it on the necessary spin speed and settings depending what's going on. Bollocks. Same temperature, spin and program regardless of what's in there."
"I had to make a bird feeder in techy at school and just slacked off the whole time, by the end of term I only had a plank of wood with two slits in it and I pretended someone stole it so the teacher gave me an A, higher than most students with actual bird feeders."
I haven't bought any sauce for over a year. I 'acquire' my condiments from my local Wetherspoon.
"When i'm waiting to cross a road and can easily run across quickly, if I see a parent and child also at the crossing I'll always wait for the green man. As i feel it sets a bad example otherwise."
I couldn't make it to the toilet so had to pee in a half full bottle of engine oil one night. Kept meaning to dispose of it but my dad put it in his car a few weeks later. The car died within a month.
"I really don't like a guy at work, to mildly inconvenience him sometimes when I go into work I try to log in using his name and a few random passwords, it locks his P.C. for an hour every morning."
"The walls in my building are paper thin. My neighbor came home drunk at 3am and partied for hours with his friends. The next morning, I blasted the Learning Bayesian Statistics podcast for two hours until they woke up. I learned a lot about Bayesian and it was wonderful."
The official reason I give for why my ex and I broke up is that we grew apart as people. The real reason is he wouldn't stop sending me videos of him pissing every time he went to the toilet.
"When I was a kid, as a ruse to get me out the bath quickly my parents told me about a character called Tommy Splodger, who lived down the plughole and drank all the water when the bath emptied. The gurgling sound was him burping. Anyway I'm an adult now and terrified of baths."
"There's a girl that gets off at the same bus stop as me every day on the way to work. When she goes to press the button to stop the bus, I wait until she almost touches it and then beat her to it. I've done this for 5 years and she still hasn't realised."
"In 2002 I borrowed a book from Leeds Central Library. It was geeky and architectural and someone had left a printed email in the middle of the book. It was sweet, I emailed, we married and had kids. Without books I'd probably be a spinster."
"Like the Wilhelm Scream, I've noticed there's a metal squeaky door sound clip that EVERY TV show and film use. My superpower is being able to hear it every time it's used. It's also a curse. I hope I've passed the curse on to you all now too."

FROM ADMIN: People keep telling us there should be a @fesshole book. Is there anyone following in the book industry who could help us with that?
"Recently spent a small fortune on a pair of retro Jordan 5's, I hide them in my wardrobe and wear them when working from home and my wife is at work; my wife would go mental if she found out and would think I'm going through a midlife crisis"
Sometimes when I'm driving I pretend I'm one of a few remaining humans in a robot-ruled world. I have to drive like a robot - extremely smoothly - so as not to be detected by the evil machines.
"On three occasions I've spent weekends in London - a six-hour drive away - visiting locations used in my favourite TV show, having told my partner I'm going there to visit friends. I have several very good friends in the city but have never once let them know I'm there."
Went to a house party when both me and my pal were on our periods. Went to the toilet but there was no bin. People were banging on the door so we panicked and put the used tampons in the bathroom cabinet next to the spare toothpaste. His parents banned house parties after that.
I never really got my smell or taste back after Covid. I've saved a fortune buying food and wine that is almost definitely awful but does the job for a third of the price
"Used to live in a shared house which was lovely bar one bloke, who randomly disappeared for weeks and then returned and acted like Begbie from Trainspotting. During one absence the rest of us moved out at same time, but not before cutting out nipple holes in all his tops."
"At uni I got a second key cut to my housemate's room and whenever he passed out really pissed I would sneak in and piss in the commemorative pint glass on his desk, filling it. Went on for a year and he got really paranoid because he could never remember doing it. Sorry Gaz."
I was in a serious accident at Uni so was allowed to use a computer for all my exams because I could type but not write. Took all the answers in on floppy disks - no one said anything. Got a really good 2:I. Thirty years on still don't feel guilty.
If the hippy lady next door is wondering why all her windchimes have been getting gradually higher in pitch over the years it's because I regularly sneak in to her garden and hacksaw 5mm off the end of one of the pipes.
"I now work in the hospital where I used to take my now deceased dad for weekly appointments. Afterwards we used to go to the restaurant for tea. Now, I sometimes go sit there with 2 cups and imagine dad's just gone to the loo."
"In the 1990s, I engaged in transactions with a sex-worker 4 times. She was in the news 3 weeks after our last meeting, found murdered. I was terrified I'd be a suspect. Couldn't tell my wife why I was stressed. Thankfully they caught the bloke quite quick. Never cheated again."
My mother had recently cleaned out my uncle's house after moving into an assisted living home. It was a mess. Inside the mess she found a silver canister. Inside were someone's ashes. We are not sure whose. I took them and spread them in the pond of a local park. RIP someone.
My husband and I like to strip naked and then go to the furthest two points away from each other in the room. We then crawl backwards whilst saying beep beeeep until our bums meet. We call it moon-dockies.
"When I was young and I heard on telly that someone was helping the police with their enquiries, I thought how cool was that and I'd love to do it. It was only in my twenties I realised that meant they were a suspect and probably guilty of murder or rape."

I go back in time and tell people about their future successes. I know its a complete fantasy but it brings me so much happiness. I just told a stoned Charlie Brooker about his life.
I wear a Wonder Woman tiara when cleaning the house. It's the only thing that makes the chores enjoyable and I pretend I'm battling evil rather than the oven grime. Blanket cape is added during laundry and bathroom days.
I went to a fancy sushi restaurant with a friend after boasting about how much I loved Japanese food. However I can't use chopsticks for shit so I just had to sort of stab the food and hope nobody noticed. They totally did.
"If I think I'm going to jizz too soon during sex, to take my mind off it & delay I nearly always resort to thinking about Liverpool FC's starting 11 and the squad tactics. Once a woman asked why she could hear me muttering the words Gini Wijnaldum. I still came too soon."
"I knew my ex was splitting up with me so I hid his passport by tucking it under his TV unit before I left. He won't think to look there, meaning he can't go on his lads holiday this year as he'll leave everything to the night before."
"Sometimes when I trim my nose hair, the effect it has, makes me make sex noises. I normally tell my wife I'm masturbating to avoid embarrassment."
I often do daily tasks with my eyes closed to imitate what it would be like if I suddenly went blind. My bathroom floor is often covered in piss because of this.
"I work with people with profound learning difficulties. I love making their lives as rich and varied as possible, but if I have bad gas, I always blame it on them."
"When I was younger I really wanted to get 24601 from Les Misérables as a tattoo, not on my chest like Valjean has it, but on my forearm. Genuinely saw no issue with getting a prisoner number tattooed on my arm. Fortunately I never went through with it."
I build Lego rockets with my 2.5 year old. I always get him to show his mum one of the ones I made for praise. I actually just really want to show off my Lego craftsmanship and get validation.
"I think enough time has now passed to say that my method of home schooling during lockdown involved placing the kids in front of the X Box, all day, everyday. Much easier."
I ran a marathon. About 3 miles from the finish line I was struggling and needed a distraction. So I ran behind a random woman just concentrating on her ass. Got to the finish line and overtook her. It was an old guy.
Each year my Mum likes it if I share a picture of us together for her birthday on social media. I always edit the pictures in a photo editing app to remove any flaws before uploading. She always loves the photos and it makes her feel good. She's none the wiser.
"FROM ADMIN: This is a daily count of the confessions coming in for the last week - I (@robmanuel) read them all to select what goes out on the account. I love it, I hate it, it takes a LOT of time. If you fancy donating to help keep me sane, thank you --&gt; https://t.co/iErSot9q1I https://t.co/GTtAvL8TKg"
"I recorded my grandparents in conversation quite a few times on my phone in my pocket. I wanted to save as much as I could of them. They're gone now and I'd love my mum to hear their voices again, but I can't bring myself to admit I secretly recorded them."
"I thought I was having a heart attack a few nights ago. My first concern was that my wife would find out that I have a porn subscription that she doesn't know about, not how horrible she would feel with me gone."
I'm scared to go up in my attic because my late Grandfathers ventriloquist dummy is up there. He gifted it to me so I could never could get rid of it. Its name is Timmy and I'm terrified of it.

"When I see a big muscle guy waiting to use the machine I'm on in the gym, I move the pin down to a much heavier weight when I'm finished so I don't look weak."
"When the kids were young, we joked that the Argos catalogue was like their version of porn. Still, probably best not to shout out across a crowded Argos store, holding up catalogue - I'll get one of these, it's just like kiddie porn. Wife pretended not to know me, obviously."
"Sat on a busy, full tube, I asked the woman stood in front of me if she'd like my seat. Curtly, she replied Why? Do I look pregnant? Without thought or hesitation I replied yes. She wasn't. Very awkward silence all around for a few more stops until she got off."
Found a wallet outside near Tesco in my village. I picked it up assuming it was my friends. I looked inside and found £700 in cash. I googled the name on the drivers license and the first result was an article on how this man was a ring leader of a drugs gang. I returned it
"My housemate left some Uni work open on his computer, an essay based on business practices of Hugo Boss. I used the find and replace function in Word to change all references in the text to Hugo's Bus. It was the final draft, he submitted an essay on some chap's toy vehicle."
A friend of mine had their wedding on Zoom over the pandemic. I forgot to watch it as I was in bed staving off a killer hangover but told them I had watched it out of embarrassment. Still think about it regularly. Sorry mate
"I was a serial cheater in my 20s. Since I got married I haven't cheated once. I try to tell myself it's because I'm a better person now, but the truth is, I just got really fat and bald, and no-one's actually interested any more."
Something smells funny in my fridge but I'm too scared to look for it. I figure if I keep the door closed then I won't have to smell it.
Despite both working full time I still do lion's share of the domestic tasks. Fed up arguing about it so just do it now. Every week when I do the weekly food shop at Asda I buy a £25 John Lewis voucher on the joint account as compensation for my time.
After I split up with my first girlfriend I went for a drive and parked up at beauty spot to get some fresh air after crying my eyes out. Didn't know that it was actually a gay hook-up spot. Random guy came over to me and asked if he could suck me off. Best blow job I ever had.
I don't want to live with my boyfriend for the sole reason I like star fishing in bed every night with the dog
"When I lived with my parents, I used to move my mum's bag around the house when I was bored to mess with her. I'm sure I'm the reason she went to the doctors 4 times in a year to get tested for dementia."
When I go to Asda/Tesco to go food shopping I always pick up things like soy sauce and hoisin sauce to look like I make fancy food. Truth is it's sits in my cupboard for a few months and then I throw it away
"My ex had a fetish about bum fun, but not on me, on him, and it always kinda weirded me out. When we split up, I spent £80 on a massive black dildo I jammed up his car exhaust. The back fire was beyond anything I'd hoped. The entire street saw."
"I spent most of my adult life thinking that when people committed suicide by sticking their head in the oven, they were cooking their brains to death. I think Sylvia Plath is a little less hardcore knowing the truth."
"Aged about 7 my friend JP and I took a shampoo bottle from the cupboard, emptied it and refilled it with piss. We replaced it and I forgot all about it. Months later we went to the Lake District on holiday. The first night there was a godawful shriek from the shower. Sorry Mum."

My wife and I have a daily Wordle competition and send each other the results. She always does her's first and sends me the results. I know her starting word so can see which letters of STARE are in - free first guess and I win every time. She thinks I'm some sort of Wordle god.
"After too much wine, my wife and I tried fisting. Would not recommend. 1 star."
I quit smoking on the first anniversary of my mums death. I couldnt tell anyone that id stopped because most people - including my wife - thought id quit about 14 years previously.
My sister and I have a WhatsApp group called Foreheads. We just post photos of people with massive foreheads. No one is safe.
"I carry a comb that is exclusively for combing my pubes. I take it everywhere. I usually have a little comb of them in whatever toilets I find myself in, it's so luxurious!"
"I have never been to Nandos. I let people know that I have never been to Nandos and never will go to Nandos because its overpriced KFC. Secretly, I would love to go to Nandos but I can't turn back now."
"When I found out my, now ex-boyfriend, cheated on me, I went into his laptop and deleted the contents of his many saved porn folders, replacing them with instructions for various flat pack furniture."
"At 6 I went to Spain with mum, dad and older brother. I'd been swimming for ages. Dad said I'd shrink if I stayed in too long. A few hours later I got changed and my underpants kept falling off. I cried and screamed thinking I'd shrunk. Turns out they were my brothers underpants."
I was caught at school with weed. My dad freaked out and decided to burn all his pornography before the police turned up to raid the house. We sat together and watched it burn in silence. It's the closest we've ever been. The police never showed up.
I text my girlfriend saying i'm going to sleep when in reality I'm playing awful games on my phone and need to be on airplane mode to stop the adverts
I'm about to live alone for the first time at 28. I'm genuinely scared I'm going to wank myself to death.
A known train company used to issue all tickets via email. After buying one I used to copy paste and change the date and time. The inspectors never checked the unique reference code as they worked for another comapany. Saved a few grand over those years.
"Dad had a shop for 29 yrs before passing away 5 yrs ago. I'm a member of the Facebook group for the town the shop was in, from time to time people will post about dad/his shop. I don't interact but reading these lovely stories about dad is the only reason I'm still on Facebook."
"Always thought I was straight but during lockdown got thinking about what it would be like to have sex with men. Tried it, loved it, not going back. Turns out maybe I'm not straight."
Dad left Mum and cleaned out the joint account as he went. He's been a bit of a prick ever since. This is why I don't mind using an Anagram Solver to absolutely trounce him at every game of Words with Friends that he sends me via Facebook.
"My husband is having an affair and won't leave as he owns half the house and still pays the bills. His mistress bought him some aftershave, I poured out half and pissed in the bottle to top it up. So everytime he goes out wearing it, he stinks of piss."

"When I broke up my partner after they said they didn't see a future with me, I swapped around all the disks in their DVD collection. All of them."
"My wife and I never lived together before we got married. It therefore came as a shock to discover she only showers once or twice a week. If I'd known about her questionable hygiene standards before I proposed, I'd definitely still be single."
"Sometimes when I go for a piss I'll say 'Go, go gadget penis' just as my urine stream is about to start. It makes me both happy and sad."
I got a video recorder when I was 14. I'd connect mine to the one downstairs and copied all my dads pornos. One was about aliens and they whistled a tune instead of speaking. One morning I came downstairs whistling the tune and my dad said where've I heard that before?
For years now I have only ever been bothered to floss my teeth the day before I've got a dentist appointment. That has apparently been enough to convince my overpriced dentist that I floss regularly.
I told my wife I have a big project for work and have locked myself in the study for hours on end. All I have done is watch 50 episodes of This Is Us in a row. It's been emotional.
"I like to add farts and more farts to my wife's Alexa shopping list, just to see her face when Alexa reads it back. It is the little things that make life fun"
"To save money with electricity prices rocketing, I have taken to having a shit and then jumping straight into the shower, avoiding wasting bog roll. My anus is sparklingly clean but sometimes a night on the beers leaves a shower tray like minestrone soup."
"My parents used to make me cross my fingers, make a wish and not speak when I seen a white horse in a field on a car journey I could speak again when I seen a dog. I was in my 40s before I realised all they were doing was getting a bit of peace and quiet."
"I always cut my hair with electric trimmers. Recently the 12mm attachment fell off mis-stroke, leaving a long skinhead strip over the top of my head. To cover it up it all came off. I told everyone at work that I did it for charity, raising £217.00."
Bought a 2nd hand espresso machine from the café down the road when they went bust at the start of lockdown and it has finally paid for itself. I hate the pretentious piece of shit and should have just walked to the Costa two roads over each day.
"A fisherman once reversed his truck into my car and refused to pay for the damage. One night when the tide was out I walked out to his boat, untied it and watched the tide come in and his boat float away."
When running around the suburban areas of Manchester I save my snot rockets for the door handles of cars parked inconsiderately on the pavement.
My friend and I once found a girl's phone in a nightclub. It was unlocked so we texted I'm pregnant to Dad before handing it in to reception.
"I haven't told my wife this, but I like to use my bellybutton as a dipping pot. Wash it out well before and after, squeeze some mayo in there, and dip my chips in it. Great for match days too. Convinced my best mate to do it once and he hasn't looked back."
"Made burgers with friends in my twenties, with bacon, cheese and onions. Then found we forgot to buy rolls so used the hot cross buns we had. I can't undo this and they'll never let me forget."
"I once shat my pants on a school camping trip and disposed of said soiled pants in another boys Wellington boot. A day or so later the heavens opened we were told to don our wellies, I'll never forget the loud scream heard over the camp when he put his foot in that Dunlop."
"Having a sneaky wank one day, found that my vibrator was stuck on. Got paranoid that people would hear it before the batteries ran out. Snuck it out of the house wrapped in an old jumper and stuffed it in a public bin by a bus stop. Always wonder if the bin people heard it."
"A girl I was once seeing introduced me to her kids as 'the tv repairman' because her tv wasn't working properly. I attempted to repair it, made it worse, suffered premature ejaculation and was never contacted again."
When I have real butter I like to eat it in a 50/50 bread to butter ratio. I would have a higher butter ratio except for my wife's disapproving looks
After a night of passion with a new lady the following morning I texted what I thought was her the message I can still smell you on my pillow. Sent that to my mum by accident. Bad enough but my mum replied asking what she smelt like.
My 3 year old daughter has a small step in the bathroom so she can sit on the loo easily. Sometimes I like to stand on it to wee so I can imagine how it feels to piss whilst being 6'4
Friend and I got coke whilst in Edinburgh for the weekend. Were flying home so couldn't take it back with us. Posted it to myself in a birthday card. Quite proud of my genius but can't tell anyone
"A colleague constantly talks about his partner of 6 years. The rest of us have never met her so we assume she's made up. Got a group chat going on specifically to track mentions of her, checking for contradictions. We have no idea how to question him about this diplomatically"
"I couldn't stand a guy I used to work with. Every morning he'd make his porridge in the staff microwave. While it was cooking, he'd pop to the loo, so I would give it an extra minute cooking time. It bubbled over so he'd have to clean the microwave. Entertained me for two weeks."
"At my first confession with a priest I didn't have anything to confess, so I made up that I swore at my mother. I did my penance - lots of praying - but really the first thing I'd done worthy of confession was lie to the priest."
I refer to Dennis the Menaces dog as Ganasher - no silent G. I didn't know about silent Gs when I was 9 and at 47 I'm not changing now.
"If my wife pisses me off, I will refuse to drink the tea or coffee she makes me, instead deliberately leaving it to go cold. That will teach her."
At our wedding we decided to place the two most argumentative people we know on the same table. Sadly this didn't create the hilarity we expected and they are now very close friends.
If I'm bored I use dating apps just to find someone to go out for a drink with and I don't see it as a date. There should be an app for people wanting to go out.
I've just found two selection boxes I forgot to give the kids at Christmas. I didn't tell them and just ate the lot in one sitting.
"I once worked with a group of people so awful that I volunteered to be the office First Aider, on the off chance that if one of them had an accident I could actively and knowledgably not provide any assistance."

I was once curious to find out what happens when the shit hits the fan. Tried it. Don't try it.
Worked night shift in Tesco on the self service tills. Realised when cleaning the tills that lots of customers dropped money into the body of the till.Each week the security guard would shift the cameras from the tills & I would recover the dropped money. Split £40+ in change!
"In the 80s went to an unfamiliar newsagents to get a recreational magazine, too late realised the girl serving went to my college. Almost died of shame but she never mentioned it to anyone, so thank you Amanda for that act of true kindness."
"One time when I was 15, I got a little vibrating kids toy called a Hexbug stuck in my ass & panicked because I thought I'd have to wake my mother up in the middle of the night to take me to the ER. I didn't have to in the end, but it still haunts me."
"FROM ADMIN: We've had @fesshole on Instagram for a while, a placeholder to stop other people grabbing it &  noticed that it's now got 9k followers?! So we're going to start posting there too - but only our fav one a day -  like a daily best of. DO FOLLOW https://t.co/eVnDNEYbQ5"
"At the weekend Hubby get up early with the children to give me a lie in. No point though, the sound of the children's laugher as he keeps them entertained means I have to get up and join them: I know one day I'll miss that noise."
"I did Jury service recently. Even though I was certain of the man's guilt, I pretended to be unconvinced during deliberations. This meant no majority and I got an extra 2 days off work before we were eventually dismissed. Not sorry."
"Before lockdown, I was very keen to ensure a got a regular 'boys night out' with friends. Just had a first night and hated it. Al I could think of was the two years of staying in with my wife eating takeaways in front of Netflix. I think I actually love her."
Many years ago I drove horribly drunk because a girl I met in a club said I could have anal sex with her if I took her home. I was so pissed I drove over one of those massive roundabouts on a major road. I still feel guilty for the people I could have killed. Worth it though.
"Prior to covid, used to travel on trains a lot. I loved a table to myself enabling me to work. To get a table to myself I would carry a four pack of Stella. Arrive on train, place 4 pack on table and pretend to fall asleep. As soon as train started Stella put away and laptop out"
I work for a bank call center. I absolutely try to make your life harder if you yell at me for things I can't control.
I've been shagging a woman in my work for about 4 years now. Part of the enjoyment comes from her man supporting my team's rivals.
"Sometimes I wrap a warm towel—straight off the radiator—round my neck and shoulders, and stand swaying with my eyes closed, all my cares temporarily forgotten in a moment of pure joy better than almost any drug I've tried, and much cheaper."
Made shroom tea at home then went out tripping for few hours. Came home to find mum under the bedsheets claiming a man with a knife was trying to kill her. House was empty and then I realised I'd forgotten to empty and rinse out the teapot. Still haven't told her 30yrs later
At school I started a secretive 'wall of cocks' behind a row of lockers that could be moved out of place. Others contributed & the dicks were graded with notes in the style of the art teachers. Over the years hundreds of penises were daubed onto this wall and left undiscovered
My husband made me orgasm through penetrative sex for the first time last night. I was thrilled! But couldn't share my joy with him 'cos he thinks he's been doing it for the last 15 years.
I once saw a detectorist working on St Ives beach. Delighted to offer him endless hours of entertainment by planting a collection of bottle tops just as the tide was coming in. Next day I poured myself a beer and watched the consequences from my harbour view flat.

"I like biting toast into shapes of countries. If I don't like the country, I stuff the whole lot in to my mouth and chew aggressively"
"When I'm on Zoom, sometime I mute and smile and say hello to my boyfriend when he's arrived home. I don't have a boyfriend."
"I used to work in a family restaurant and often dressed up as the mascot, I found that if I slid down the plastic slide, it charged up the nylon suit and made me into a walking ball of static energy. So, when the kids used to hug me, I'd electrocute the little bastards"
"Years ago I used to work in a café and an old lady used to come in and order a cappuccino but pronounced it - Cappa-key-no so when she went to pay I used to pretend I'd lost her bill, so then she would say it again because I found it so funny"
During a boring Teams meeting I love muting the person talking and watching the chaos ensue as everyone blames the speaker for accidentally muting themselves.
"Wife left her car lights on & got a simple flat battery. I cocked up a jump start, blew all the fuses & destroyed the starter motor. It's cost nearly £1k to fix. I've not admitted I did the real damage & she thinks it's her fault. We've had to skip this year's holiday."
"When I'm feeling in the mood for a wank, I suggest to my wife that my mother might come round for a visit. She's so houseproud, she HAS to clean up the entire downstairs, giving me a good 20 minutes of peace."
"I worked as an accountant and whenever a client was rude to me, I'd shred some of their expense invoices so they had to pay more tax."
I conned my parents out of 3k so I could get my eyes lasered. I didn't get them lasered. Now I have to wear contacts whenever I meet up with them.
Me and a mate stole a tenner that was poking out of a drunken ladies bag while she snogged my uncle in a night club. I do feel guilty but at the time it felt like compensation for having to witness her eating his face off
"I met my husband before we had mobile phones, which is lucky because if we'd been texting when dating I'd have dumped him for his shit spelling and complete lack of knowledge on which their there or they're to use"
I no longer love my girlfriend. But I don't want to leave her cos we just got a new sofa that's literally so nice and comfy I don't want anything to come between me and it.
I'm fiercely loyal to my barber/hairdresser. My job means I work away for long periods and sometimes I have to get my hair cut from someone else. I message him and apologise for what he will have to correct when I get back. Probably more loyal to him than previous relationships.
And if you fancy bunging some coins in the pot for our time reading all your alarming confessions - we would appreciate it - thank you. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I
Been dealing with out-of-date yoghurt in my fridge by hurling them off my balcony at night. I don't know why I do this but it's strangely exciting. I can make contact with 6 neighbouring properties if I give the yoghurts a really good cunting.
A mate was using an online dating site but he wasn't getting any women contacting him. I therefore became Juicy Lucy & got in touch with him. The online romance blossomed until I started feeling guilty so I told him I was in prison for murder at which point it all ended.
Each night I cook my husband a beautiful meal with the plan to tell him that I want to end our marriage. I stop myself each night. I have cooked my way through 3 Nigel Slater Cookbooks so far.

We rotate hand wash in the bathrooms so frequent visitors think we use far more than we actually do. I'm fully aware that they probably don't even notice and that I'm nuts for doing it.
"I had a blazing row with my husband about not storing our new skirting board under our bed, poking out & causing a trip hazard. That evening when he tripped over it in the dark and wrecked himself against the wall was one of the greatest moments of my life."
I took out a loan for £7500 to buy crypto currency because I thought it was going to go up. It has gone down and now I have a loan repayable over 48 months. I haven't told my wife as we could have spent the money on a washing machine. We currently have to use the launderette.
"My boss and I share a TV at work with two HDMI ports, for screening/reviewing footage. He got really mad and insistent that he should be HDMI1, so every now and then I switch it. Little things."
"I get really bored that people presume myself and my business partner are having an affair, It's 2022 of course a man and woman can run a business without a hidden agenda. I mean we are having an affair and have been for a decade but that's not the point."
"I'm a sex worker and when I found an enlarged prostate, I encouraged the client to go and see a doctor. Don't be scared to do bum stuff guys, it might save your life."
"I'm a teacher. I regularly hear students in hushed tones refer to pornstars such as Johnny Sins, Mandingo, Danny D. I'm supposed to challenge inappropriate conversations. But doing so here will self-incriminate and maybe even get me fired. So I ignore it. I've a mortgage to pay."
I love it when the kids are naughty and I get out of bedtime reading as a punishment to them.
I love Facebook memories - I see all the things I used to say that would now get me cancelled so I can delete them in case I ever end up in the public eye. Wish twitter had a similar feature.
"I have an expensive backlit mechanical keyboard having going down a nostalgic rabbit hole on Reddit. I expensed it to my boss for homeworking despite them sending me a £20 one with Apple style keys. Worst bit is, I prefer the £20 one, which I hide if I have geek friends visit."
"We've banned Peppa Pig from the house, because she's naughty for the sake of being naughty and thus a bad rolemodel. However the real reason I supported this banning is that as I'm fat, middle-aged, wear glasses and work in IT, I'm Daddy Pig's double."
"A couple of years ago, I took a viagra and half an E in the expectation of a night of filthy sex with my mistress. She canceled at short notice so my wife bore the brunt of it. I've been happily married, faithful and fulfilled since."
As a 17yr old student I wasn't earning enough to reliably go pubbing every weekend. I once told my parents there was a school weekend trip organised - they gave me £70 to pay for it and I went and camped in the woods behind our house for the weekend.
"Once pretended to be partially sighted just to convince a taxi driver to take me and my 'guide' dog home after a skinful at the pub. He wouldn't have taken us otherwise, but despite my dog being on a normal lead, he agreed to. The potential karma still haunts me to this day."
"Working in a call-centre in 2005, my colleagues & I would keep details of customers who were rude to us. We'd call their homes from pay-phones on our way back from nightclubs, asking them, by name, to discuss their anger issues with us. If anything, it just made them more angry."
Just been to pick up a parcel from the post office. I thought I would be thoughtful dad and rang the Mrs to see if the children wanted a breakfast roll from greggs. I got what they wanted but had a sneaky bake to myself as well as a roll for when I got in with breakfast.

"I was praised by a teacher for being 'too honest' and owning up to anything I did wrong. It made me realise that owning up to small things meant I could get away with big things. As an adult, this has got me out of trouble at least twice. It makes me wonder if I'm a psychopath."
"To mend my carpet slippers I superglued new in-soles into them and stood on them to make them stick. Then... you've guessed it, a weekend indoors trying to peel the fuckers off my feet. Struggled to walk for a week due to ripped skin."
"People in the next hotel room partied noisily till nearly 3. We were up for an early start so I phoned the room with the early morning call they'd requested at 6 when up for a shower, 6.30 when we went for breakfast, 7 when we returned and 7.30 when we left."
Once I went to the GP because I thought I had a belly button infection - it smelled and was oozing. Turned out it was just dirty and I wasn't cleaning myself properly. I cringe when I think about what the GP would have said afterwards.
"After reading about the wonderful work that Timpson - the shoe repair people- do with employing ex-prisoners, I can't walk past one of their shops without imagining what crime the bloke behind the counter was locked up for."
"When bored, I like to try and hack strangers' Slido events by trying random six digit number Slido event codes; if it works, I quite enjoy adding in a completely irrelevant question e.g Why is the sky blue or Can dogs look up ?"
"When I read to my children, I give all the characters voices from Eastenders and Carry On films. Dumbledore and McGonagall are Sid James and Hattie Jacques. Voldemort is Nick Cotton."
"I could never remember how an ex pronounced her surname. I had to watch a YouTube video of a librarian conference where she introduced herself to remember, but then I'd forget again. This went on for four years."
Working from home has led me to become more lazy. I don't get dressed until 10 minutes before my Mrs is home from her in-the-office job. I use find a friend on the iPhone to keep an eye on how far away she is.
"I've spent the last 6 months on video conference calls tapping SOS for 1 minute with my index finger on my shoulder. It's safe to say that this test was a failure. If I was ever held hostage and needed to let someone know that I'm in danger, I'm a dead man."
"I was told once as a child that if you Googled the the computer would blow up. On a bad day at school, I went to the computer room and grimly typed in the to cause IT meltdown. I was very disappointed."
I've been throwing away my partner's poor choices of clothing for years. First step is they will stay at the bottom of the laundry basket for a few months - he never goes there - then next step is to put them out in a charity collection bag. Job done.
"I've started going to a chess club because a girl I fancy wanted to go. I now spend one evening a week being beaten by old men at a game I find boring, in the hope of sex."
"I watched The Shining when I was young man & developed a fear of the number 237. I'm now middle aged, but if I wake up in the night needing a wee and the time is anywhere close to 2.37, I'm too frightened to go to the loo."
"Oi! Don't forget to buy tickets to our second Fesshole Live date  (Central London, 11th May 2022). There's going to be... live confessions. How will this work? Well come and find out."

"After several embarrassingly unsuccessful DM slides recently, I've finally had to admit to myself that liking all my tweets is not actually an indication that a woman fancies me."
"Until fairly recently, I thought a spinning class involved people spinning around and around until they got dizzy."

"My wife thinks I do the weekly shop to be kind to her. In reality it's because I get an opportunity to eat a combo of scotch eggs, pork pies, and smoked cheese in the car afterwards; sometimes all three. It's not the highlight of my week, but it's usually up there."
"Years ago, my skin turned a faint blue tinge one day. I was rushed to hospital as it's a symptom of Cyanosis which can be very serious. After hours of tests which stumped doctors, it turned out it was fabric dye rubbed off onto my skin from my brand new blue bed sheets."
"On our anniversary and sometimes for valentines, my husband buys me expensive flowers from the florist. I wish he wouldn't and instead book us into a hotel so we can have lots of noisy sex without worrying about the kids."
"A computer broke and I explained to my wife that I needed to pay for data extraction because I had important work files I hadn't backed up. Actually, I couldn't bear to lose the 40,000 words of my, doubtless terrible, attempt at an erotic novel."
I make a pod coffee every morning before work but like to open the machine just before it finishes each time to get the smoke and hiss. Makes me feel like Darth Vader taking his helmet off after a long day.
"I emptied out the Listerine bottle and filled it with Scotch which is a similar colour. I put it on the bathroom sink in plain sight and whenever I need a slug, I just tell the wife that I'm cleaning my teeth. She hates the stuff so it's safe."
"I do my 8-year-old sons homework for him when he's asleep. He shouldn't be doing homework at weekends, that's when he plays GTA."
"I once left the result of 'self love' on my desk in my office at home by mistake. It was a slow day. My wife found it, and out of panic, I said the cat had been sick. She took the cat to the vet, and worse still, the vet charged us for eye-wateringly expensive antiemetics."
"I often take a plastic pint glass into the loo just so I can marvel at the volume, colour and temperature of my piss."
I found the Greggs coffee stamp on eBay for £20. I've not paid for a coffee from Greggs in over 2 years.
Since my son has started teething he hasn't been great at sleeping. To help him settle I've been watching Star Wars: The Clone Wars with him. Even though he's only 16 months old and wouldn't understand what's going on I daren't watch an episode without him in case he misses it
Once turned to my pal in an A-level Geography lesson to tell him I had a sore dick and instead muttered I have a small dick. We never acknowledge it happened or ever spoke about it.
"When I was still living with my ex-husband he never did any washing or cleaning so sometimes I would take his clothes out of the washing pile, fold them up and give them back to him unwashed. He never noticed."
I slice pieces of butter and use it like cheese in my sandwiches
"Stopped wearing condoms as they made my cock smell afterwards and they cost a fair bit & resorted to the pull-out method. Well, let me tell you, ladies and gents, that the little bundle of joy we are expecting in two months will cost a hell of a lot more than condoms."
"Whilst walking the dog, I saw a car throw litter out the window. A few mins later and the car was stuck in a line of traffic. I picked up the litter and put it under the wiper, good deed done for the day. Only to return to my girlfriend who told me I had the wrong red car."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something nasty with a crochet hook?
"My middle-aged wife has started piling on the weight and wearing dark sunglasses. It's like being married to Roy Orbison in his twilight years, minus the sideburns."
"When I haven't shaved for a few days, I always do a Hitler tache before shaving it all off. I know he was evil, but he also looked ridiculous."
"I saw my neighbor gardening and congratulated her on her pregnancy. Turns out she wasn't pregnant. Put my house on the market the next day, it seemed the only decent thing to do"
"At a restaurant me & my friend noticed that a couple had left a lot of their shared pizza. We decided to eat their 'leftovers', only to be told by the waiter that the couple had only gone out for a cigarette. Managed to pay up before the couple returned to a clean plate."
Our cleaner is so useless that we pay a second cleaner to come when she is gone. We can't bring ourselves to sack the first one as she's just a really nice lady.
I can't wait for you to fuck my arse and for me to cum on your chest while you wank me was the WhatsApp I accidentally sent to my Dad instead of guy called Dave.
"My husband claims to hate Marmite, but has consumed more of it than he will ever know. If ever he's a bit of a twat, I'll stir a spoonful into his food and take silent delight when he demolishes his meal."
A few years ago I found a pristine 1970s porn mag in my loft. It's like having a wank in a time machine when I get it out
"After getting screwed over by a lettings agent at uni, I decided to open a Twitter account for the agency as they didn't already have one. Played it straight for a while and built up some followers, and then started tweeting the worst material I could from them."
"I bought a beautiful 1920s typewriter. My boyfriend hated it, said it was ugly & creepy looking. "
"I recorded the sound of myself typing on it, and hid a bluetooth speaker in that room, to secretly play the typing sounds occasionally when he's with me. "
I say I hear nothing.
Our pizza was 40 minutes late so I called the pizza place. They had no record of our order. I insisted they look and they went to get the manager. Our pizza then arrived - from a different pizza place. I just hung up the phone. Mortified.
"I'm always telling people that ghosts don't exist, the supernatural is a load of bollocks etc. Stayed at a 'haunted' hotel in the Cotswolds, it felt a bit creepy. I kept the big light on all night and didn't sleep a wink."
Since having a water meter fitted I've tried to flush my toilet as little as possible. I've now become obsessed with this and found myself going outside in the garden with my dog every morning for a dump. It's become a bonding session and my bill is now around £15 a month.
"Before my partner moving in with me, I used to rent my spare room out. One of the tenants left owing me about £500, saying they would pay it back. Never had the money back. So any mail sent to the house in their name had return to sender, addressee deceased written on it"
Boss is ex army and as a joke birthday present the team ordered him a hand grenade shaped lighter. We didn't know all inbound post is xrayed…. Bomb alert triggered and the whole 30 floor building was evacuated. We denied all knowledge in the subsequent inquiry.
"Unbeknown to my gf, I used to bite my finger nails and drop them down the back of the sofa cos I was too lazy to take them to the kitchen bin. When we came to move out, I forgot about it and my gf found a large pile of finger nails on the carpet. I've never been so ashamed."

I've discovered there's a teenager girl working at my M&S food store who can't be bothered with difficult to scan or missing barcodes. She just pretends to put them through and you get the item for free. So now I seek her out and purposely damage a couple of barcodes.
I was one of the thousands of people who quit World of Warcraft because of the huge sexual harassment scandal a few months ago. I left an angry screw this evil company unsubbing message when I did. I was back playing in hidden mode less than 24hrs later.
I once go so stoned I watched an entire movie on mute & cried because I thought I'd gone deaf
"I've completely fallen out of love with my girlfriend, but our friendship group is so tight knit that I can never break up with her. Her two best friends are dating my two best friends and I love them all so much. I'll probably marry her to keep the gang together."
I left my model train magazine in the masturbation room at the fertility clinic. I couldn't ask for it back - I was too embarrassed they'd think I'd been wanking to miniature locomotives.
Haven't done any Charlie in two decades. But when I'm in the kitchen chopping up herbs I have to form it into lines for old time's sake.
"I'm 30 and like nothing better than going to the pub on my own. I'll happily sit there and have 3 or 4 pints, knowing I don't have to interact with anyone. It's absolute bliss."
"Both my children still need cuddles to get off to sleep. When people ask how they're sleeping I roll my eyes and pretend it's really bad as they don't get themselves off to sleep or sleep through. Secretly, I love the cuddles and never want it to end."
"When I was 18, I worked for a watch co. in London. I had to deliver a Rolex to a beautiful woman at Heathrow, who was surprising her bf with it and a holiday. She got stood up and asked me if I wanted to go. It haunts me to this day that I didn't go, 30 yrs later."
My husband has the volume on the TV really high and plays football podcasts very loudly. This annoys me so I deliberately speak very quietly to him to convince him that he is going deaf .
"Other half uses my expensive body lotion when he wanks. I've nothing against him wanking, but it royally pisses me off he uses my cream then denies it. So I've just filled an empty tub with cheap hair removal cream."
"I make up names for all the other parents on the school run, so far there is guppy faced woman, trophy wife, Peter Jones' little brother, Ursula, pea eyes, stick insect, weirdy beardy, trout face and captain caveman. I don't speak to any of them and nobody knows."
"When my mother-in-law died, we found a notebook detailing all the animals buried in her garden, not only hers but neighbours. She'd lived there nearly 70 years and there were 63 listed. House had already sold so we didn't mention it."
Been living with my partner for a short while. In the dead of night had to plunge my hand in to the toilet to wipe away a massive skid I made to avoid waking them using the loo brush. Was too effective and now I'm worried it will become my usual method
"Tickets are up for Fesshole Live 2. I.e. the second date for the show coz the first date has sold out and we figured FUCK IT. There will be guests, live confessions and more and it's central London (Leicester Sq) 11th May 2022. DO COME OK?"

I once dropped a spliff in panic when I saw Mark Wingett aka Carver from The Bill coming around the corner. The sad part is he was sitting near us in the pub earlier and I was well aware he wasn't real police
I had a French friend who worked in a cafe and asked me how to write a resignation letter. I told her to put 'my position has become untenable'. The owner fell about laughing at her and I felt terrible. I was 18 and honestly thought that's what you were meant to say.

I once worked in a mind numbing office and decided to put a colleague's lease car for sale in the local ads at a bargain price. He received over 90 calls and I could hear him going nuts across the office. Especially as the contact name was Timmy and he hated being called that
Every leap year I take an unjustified sick day. They're not getting an extra days work out of me for no extra money.
"Several years back I photocopied my clubcard barcode, printed it on a self adhesive label and stuck it over my colleagues card. He collected Clubcard points for me for about 12 months. We no longer work together and haven't spoken since."
During lockdown I was rejected for a £110k job for being too serious and professional for the company culture. I'd done the whole zoom interview naked from the waist down because I'd spilt ribena on my lap just before it started. My balls kept sticking to the desk chair.
"I enjoy the darts on the telly. Always wished I was up there battling it out with the pros as I already have my nickname, shirt style/colours & walk on music ready to go. Only trouble is, I'm shit at darts."
"I used to work in a petrol station and businessmen in suits would often buy cigarettes and a lighter when paying for fuel, I'd ask them what colour lighter and if they said any I'd give them a pink one to see their reaction. It was a boring job."
My 10 year old was struggling with some homework where she has to write a poem about the spring. I helped her out and wrote the whole chorus of 'Corner of Earth' by Jamiroquai - she got a C. Sorry Jay Kay you need to try harder.
"I'm a bus driver. If I'm having a bad day at work, I'll look in the mirror while driving, and mutter to myself you're all cunts aren't you? and then tap the brakes twice so they all nod."
"I have a spreadsheet where I rank milk based on how well the plastic top peels off. Aldi currently on top, zero foil remains, great peel."
"Sometimes when I've had a few beers I watch my wedding video on rewind, I especially like the bit where they walk backwards down the aisle, get in the car and fuck off into the distance."
"When I'm bored I make a new Reddit account and join a random community like DIY, finance, legal advice etc and see how often I can get the top comment giving advice on a topic I know nothing about."
Coworker kept commenting on my weight loss so before we switched to WFH I took their computer and made spelling errors in all of the usernames + added shortcuts so every time they type it autocorrects to the wrong spelling.Takes them an extra 2 minutes to do anything.I relish it.
"As a young waitress, I used to play fast and loose with the decaf coffee jug often mixing it up with regular coffee when serving. Now I'm middle-aged with horrendous anxiety and I deeply regret any palpitations caused by the carelessness of my youth."
"My neighbour fell out with me & would send taxis & pizzas to my house in the early am. One night I had enough, the following morning I rang the undertakers pretending to be her partner & that afternoon she opened her door to them coming to collect the body. She stopped."
I've started swimming once a week in a local baths but I'm not telling anyone because it's really quiet in the afternoons and I don't want you to come
"Neighbour really pissed me off once, can't remember why. For the next few weeks I'd get up early on bin day and bring his full bin in and then put it back out once the lorry had gone. He would go fucking ballistic when he found his bin still full."

"I convinced my two young children that I invited cheese, the spiky bits on pineapples, daytime and the name Stuart, I forgot about it and several months later, my daughter came home from school and informed me that her teacher said your father didn't invent cheese or daytime"
I'm so useless and bored at my current job. There's maybe 1hr of work in a regular 9-5.30 day for me to do. They insist I'm necessary. I'm being paid to scroll social media and I feel guilty.
I ran a 5K with my 5 year old son. This route was 2 laps. He got tired on the first lap and ended up just crossing the finish line. They announced him as being the fastest 5 year old and gave him a new scooter. He was so excited we never told anyone.
When I mark pupils books I like to use strawberry gel pens to try to combat the smell of stale dinner and cigarette smoke that books often stink of.
Sometimes I intentionally do housework or manual tasks badly just so that my fiancé doesn't ask me to do it again
Tutored a posh kid in his huge house. Turned up one morning still pissed from an all night poker game. Had to run to the bathroom to throw up with both taps on full to drown out the noise. Rubbed some toothpaste round my gums and went back. He got an A star though so I don't f...
Had to put forward a business case to get a second screen at work. Gave them a load of waffle about productivity. Now have a spare screen to watch the winter Olympics on.
"My ex-boyfriend cheated on me with someone he worked with, so when a vacancy came up at the place they both worked I applied just to scare them a bit. I wasted six hours on that application for a job I was never going to take, I just wanted to be petty."
I profess to hate everything about getting older whilst quietly enjoying the general acceptance of my grumpiness and being pathetically excited about my imminent free bus pass even though I hate busses.
"I used to work on a call centre, I'd look at the call waiting screen, when I was next in line to take a call I'd call the call centre from my internal phone, pretend I couldn't hear the person on the other end, and hang up. I'd move to the back of the queue. My stats were insane."
When I'm driving on the motorway I award myself 1 point per wheel every time I change lanes without going over the studs/cats' eyes. I'd got to my high score of 121 points when some twat beeped at me and broke my concentration.
It isn't the hard work or the cost of healthier living that puts me off of losing weight but the thought of having to go through the hassle and expense of replacing all my clothes.
I blocked a guy on Grindr after a couple of exchanges. Only because he said he was having dirty 'faults' rather than 'thoughts'. I can't shag the thick.
"I was vegan for 4 months, believing I was doing it for the right reasons. Turned out I had a crush on the new girl at work who just so happened to be a vegan, and apparently everyone in the office clocked it as soon as I went on the diet in the first place."
Let's do it. Let's do our favourite anonymous confessions for February 2022 and my golly gosh haven't you lot done well? So many great stories. Please share far and wide to encourage people to follow @fesshole and keep the stories coming in. THANK YOU EVERYONE. https://t.co/42hkqwTa3l
I have psoriasis and have very flaky skin on my elbows. I scratch myself so much so there's loads of powdery skin on my office desk. I then chop it into lines with a credit card so it looks like coke and not a skin disease.
"Married lover gave me a special present for my birthday and my husband found it and asked where I got it. Panicked, I said it was for the kids' Xmas, so lover's gift to me ended up as a Santa gift for daughter. Still get flutters when I see her wearing it."

"In the 90s, my dad used to think nobody could tell the difference between undies & speedo. He'd go to the beach in his underpants then go swimming. This should really be his confession."
During lockdown at work I decided to shit into a microwave. My two colleagues were there and one got our other mate on live video call. After the deed had been done we turned the microwave on and cooked it. The smell clung to the walls for a good couple of days.
"Someone keeps leaving skid marks, who isn't using the toilet brush? asked mum. 8yo me didn't know she meant in the bowl. Or that the brush wasn't for personal use. Nobody ever knew how I got that infection, but now you do."
"I had to sack someone on the spot for gross misconduct. She cried. That night I was telling my wife about my day & then we got on to topic of what to eat. I said I was full, there had been a lot of cake in the office that day. Then I realised - I'd sacked the girl on her birthday"
I started renting my house 17 years ago. The Chinese owner vanished 15 years ago. The management company went insolvent in 2008. My rent started bouncing back 6 months later and no one has ever contacted me. I think I can claim squatters rights but I'm too frightened to try.
I often go into my positive feedback on Ebay to cheer myself up. It's lovely seeing that people think I'm a great ebayer and would hope to deal with me again.
"Early 90's, Dad was in counter terror. I overheard a genuine code word while he was on the phone. Three days later my school was evacuated for a bomb threat. Police, army, everything. He never asked but I think he knew. Both of us would have been in the shit if he said anything."
Met a guy at the park walking the dogs. He walked his there at the same time. We decided to come back to mine to fool about. After we finished I showed him out. I couldn't find 2 of the condoms we used. Found them the next morning. My dogs shat them out. At the park
We've run out of nappies so I've just put my three year old to bed in undies and one of my Tena lady pads. Serves him right for being a bowling ball of a baby that caused me to need said pads. One for his 18th
The only reason I now know how to spell 'amateur' without checking it is from typing it in to porn sites so many times.
"On cold mornings I secretly defrost all the cars in the private car park on the flat complex where I live, I like to think of myself as a secret but caring vigilante"
I used to wait tables in a chain pub. Whenever someone ordered a steak I would ask them after their meal how did you find the steak? so that they could make the obvious joke if they wanted to. Many did. I like to think I made their day a little brighter.
"I recently started following an old school friend on Twitter, thought it'd be nice to reconnect. Turns out he's now pretty far-right wing and I take great joy in reporting the dodgiest posts he likes to Twitter to be taken down. Sorry-not-sorry."
I used to come home steaming drunk and piss in the olive tree pot by the front door every time weren't til a year or so ago my dad told me my Nans ashes were in there
My daughter asked me for help writing a poem about war for her GCSE English. I gave her the lyrics to a song called 'Battle Of The Bean Field' by The Levellers. She got an A star.
When I was a child I used to pretend my cats could talk. I made up different voices and personalities for them and would use them to speak to my brother. He even assumed the identity of one of the other cats so we used to have ridiculous conversations as the cats.

"I'm 52 and have never taken my car through a car wash and the thought of it scares me, so I am trying to convince my wife to do it without admitting that I am being really weird about it."
"When I was about 12, I stole a cheap '110' camera from Boots. I felt guilty so took it to the police station and said I'd found it. One month later, as no one had collected it the police gave it back to me and said I could keep it."
I've been promoted twice since 2020 despite averaging 4-5 hours of Football Manager each day. I delegate boring tasks to my team and share it to my bosses as huge successes. I even watch fake Youtube vids of conference calls to make my Mrs think I'm in meetings.
For years i was under the impression that Mein Fuhrer meant motherfucker in German. I'd say it frequently at work when i'd make a small mistake or at soccer when I'd miss a chance. It turns out i was mistaken and that many people have due reason to assume i'm a Nazi.
Aged 14 I stole my Grandads war medals from his drawer and sold them for a tenner. No-one ever knew. Wracked with guilt for years I have since bought replacements which are on display with his photo. I still feel a bit ashamed every time I walk pass it. He was a hero.
"On a Japan Airlines flight I drank 3 cups of sake followed by a Stilnox sleeping tablet. I woke up after a long sleep feeling terrible and the flight attendant informed me I had poured water on the crotch of the man seated next to me, and told everyone he had pissed his pants."
Had my phone pickpocketed in the supermarket at Christmas and billed work for a new one at about £500... found it under the car seat last night. They must never know.
"I dont know my sister's birthday. Its either July 30th or July 31st. The reason I dont know it is because the family dog we had when I was growing up, its birthday was July 30th or July 31st. I could write it down but I just aim to get the card out for the 30th"
It helps me push my poos out if I rub my thighs like a horny Vic Reeves.
The biggest impact of Covid for me has been the lack of opportunities for random gay sex with strangers whilst on work trips. Instead I have had occasional sex with my wife whilst our lockdown dog watches on from the end of the bed.
"Remember Secret DJ, the app you could choose the music in the venue you were in for free? I realised I could control the jukebox in a Vodka Revolution from my desk in the building next door so I'd play Seven Days by Craig David on repeat. The staff turned it off after a week."
"Every one of my exes has gone on to meet the love of their lives right after me—always genuinely fantastic people, often extremely intelligent and kind. Meanwhile I'm having to face the fact that I may well be the problem."
"I smashed a glass of sentimental value at my boyfriend's house. Tracked down an identical one on eBay, ordered it to my work address, replaced it & haven't told him."
I cheated on my husband and my dog who never barks started barking and howling at the man. Now anytime the man I'm cheating with comes near me my dog barks. Even my husband has noticed and mentioned it. I can tell she is judging me.
"FROM ADMIN: Running @fesshole is, of course, a joy and also a massive time suck reading all the submissions and picking out what to post. If you fancy lobbing in some coppers for my (@robmanuel) time then I would appreciate it. Thank you. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"Whenever I'm at the petrol station I always use the preset amounts to make it easier but when filling up, I stand with my back to it so people will think I'm amazing at stopping dead on what I want. I don't tell anyone because I think they'll think I'm sad."
Since shaving my bum hair my parps have dropped in note. Maybe as much as a semitone.
I sat opposite a man on a train; he had been doing a crossword but had fallen asleep. I added swear words in all the blank spaces and got off before he woke up.
"I've been utterly besotted by a taken man for most of my adult life. Knew nothing wld ever happen but still fantasised. He recently used holibobs in a text and I am finally, mercifully, 100% cured."
"When phoning for a takeaway, I'll often ask restaurant to hold on whilst I check the order is correct with my friends. I'm not checking. There is nobody else. I'm a fat bastard. I just don't want the takeaway to know."
"Friend unexpectedly asked me to be chief bridesmaid. Absolutely gutted now have to arrange a hen do I don't want to go on, wear a dress I don't want to wear and pretend to be interested in things like flowers and table plans. I'm 40 and can't be bothered with any of it."
"About 18 months ago, to entertain myself in lockdown I began writing an erotic novel about Morse and Lewis, who discover mutual passion and indulge it in creative ways. No-one but me will ever read it. It is now over 50,000 words in length. The heroes are still hard at it."
One of the best perks of home working is being able to crank the Jim'll Fix It theme tune up to 11 and bounce around on my daughter's space hopper. Best 2 1/2 minutes of the day.
"I sold this Makita cordless power drill in the local paper. And then six months later, I received the very same one back as a Christmas present from my brother-in-law, minus the power pack."
"Once lied when asked if I had stolen a friend's Nintendo DS game and told my mum she must have lost it herself. Was insistent on this and tossed the evidence out my bedroom window where it sat in the gutter for months, mocking me. Didn't even get to play the game SMH"
"Today the cat sat on my desk and left a brown crumb of 'dirt'. I didn't know if it was mud or dry cat poo so I picked it up and sniffed it, and in the process snorted it up into my nostril. Discovered it was shit. I have no one in my life I can tell about this misadventure."
"As a 16-year old, I tried to save money at the cinema by saying I was 14. The film I was trying to buy a ticket for was rated 15 so was refused entry."
"My wife always starts her text messages to me with Hi Babe or Hun, for the last few years I've replied with my little Honey Badger. She thinks it's cute but she hasn't twigged that honey badgers are amongst the nastiest, most vicious bastards on the planet."
"My husband got a new job where he works closely with a woman. They chat for hours and get on like a house on fire. If he left me for her I wouldn't actually mind - we've drifted apart anyway, and they're so similar it's spooky. It's bizarre but I'm kind of rooting for him."
"After a uni rugby match I crushed my balls between 2 slats of a changing room bench that shifted when I sat down. Passed out. Lied that they got hurt during the match and I'd ignored it, spent a week showing off purple swelling to mates who thought I was the toughest player ever."
"Work at Tesco. Whenever we close early on Sundays, I take great pleasure sitting in my car watching people approach the store only"
to be turned away. The longer they spend gathering their bags the funnier it is seeing the look of defeat in their faces plodding back to their car
"I was on my laptop last night when my wife told me to turn it off, as she could see my work was just upsetting me. I didn't like to tell her my team on Football Manager had just suffered a particularly distressing 5-2 defeat."
Sainsbury's self scan app says it's meant to give you special offers but it never does. So I make up my own offers. Which is always a BOGOF offer.

Two of my three children now have high sleeper beds to give them more floor space for playing. It breaks my heart that I can't give them a good night kiss when I come upstairs to bed like I've done every other night for the last ten years. Dad x
Sometimes in public I'll loudly pretend I'm engaged in a business deal on my phone. I'll take four point eight million. I'm not going any lower than that. I know it's sad.
For a while I found it amusing to give my mother's maiden name as 'Hitler' when signing up for store credit etc. Now it's causing issues as I can't remember which ones I said it to.
"I check my wife's phone when she's not looking, not to check on her cheating, but to get present ideas. She's always shocked when I get what she wanted"
When I was a teenager I fashioned a rudimentary fleshlight using a toilet roll tube and a polythene document wallet coated with vaseline. I used to shag my pillow whilst looking at page 3 girls.

Boss asked for my 'expert' advice while buying his first Rolex after admiring mine for months. He paid £9000 and waited 9 months for it to arrive. Bought mine in Turkey for €100.

"There's a woman at work I have a major crush on. The printer is in my office and 9 times out of 10, it's her who printed something that she'll come to collect. It's at a point now where the sound of a printer going off makes me hard."
"At the train station, train wasnt due to arrive 30 minutes so I was annoyed and hungover. I sat alone on the platform staring at the tracks. a man approached me and asked if I was okay and said things will get better. Not suicidal mate just hungover but thanks for the concern"

Accidentally text a colleague that I 'needed a good seeing to' on Friday night. I can't bear to see him at work tomorrow so I think it's best if I resign and go work in a different country.
I used to work in a Co-op and would intentionally turn a blind eye to the scrotes stealing expensive meat and booze so I could go to the nearby alleyway after my shift and get them for cheap. I’d buy it while still in my Co-op uniform and eventually make specific orders.
"I forgot my wife's birthday, luckily her work sent a huge bunch of flowers to the house while she was out. I quickly went to the shop and bought a crappy bunch for £8 and switched the tags over."
As teenagers my father's seccond wife's daughter and me found a pack of condoms in a drawyer. We put a hole with a needle through every single one of them.Still not sure about direct causation... but it is nice to have a much younger little half brother.
My wife looks through my phone thinking I don't know but since she became addicted to Wordle I've started solving it early every day and leaving the result up so it's the first thing you see when you open the phone... she's stopped looking & I can continue my affair in peace.
"I was ripped off by a customer, he refused to pay for some work I did in his shop. I waited for over a year to get revenge. One dark night I turned off the shop water supply at the main valve in the street. Then filled the valve chamber with broken up house bricks and concrete."
"I join local town/village grumbler Facebook groups with a fake account, despite being nowhere near. I get a kick winding up NIMBYs. My favourite is saying I saw a local councillor not pick up dog poo or is mates with someone building houses. They lose their fucking minds"
"Taxi driver here, I often short change drunk people a quid. Even more if they're in any way obnoxious and rude - which they often are. Best was a non-payer who got in my cab the following week, took £30 off her, should've been £7.20."
I've been with my boyfriend for a while now. I love him with all my heart but I'm almost embarrassed by how ugly some of his exes are.

"In Homebase for masonry paint, I wondered if the weather was going to be OK to do the outdoor work needed. So I asked, loudly, to nothing: Alexa, what's the weather today? as if I was at home near an Echo Dot. Many, many people heard. I left paintless and embarrassed"
"I recently emigrated and left all my stuff behind. The walls of my new place are bare and I don't have much money for art. When I see a cute, well photographed dog on Twitter I screenshot and put it in an A5 frame. My walls are filling up nicely with pics of all your pets."

"Other half can't butter toast properly. Mashes it into the bread, and then cuts the slice in half so the pool of butter runs over the plate. It's horrific. If I'd known, I wouldn't have moved in with him."
"I once went home with a guy who whilst in the bedroom took great pride in showing me that his ball sack stretched all the way down to his knees over and over again. I declined sex, waited for him to fall asleep and walked home. I didn't return his calls."
"During first lockdown, me and my partner would shag every Thursday evening and time our orgasms for when the clapping started. We'd pretend it was for us."
"I have a Tesco credit card. I make one purchase per month, and pay it in full, minus 99p. Then on my next statement, they always scrap the 99p as a small balance write off. I like to think of it as a small victory for the common man. £5.99 worth of goods for a fiver? Yes please!"

"I once saw a guy shop lifting at Tesco's. I could have let him get away with it, but I snitched. Still feel bad"

"Whenever I have a falling out with someone on Twitter I scan their profile for offensive posts. When I find one I keep looking, reporting them all. I don't stop till I stop finding them or get bored. I usually get bored first."
"At the cinema and the couple next to me were talking non stop. When they left i saw the woman's purse, I could've called her back to take it with them but handed it into a member of staff instead. Them having to come back to the venue and the worry involved was their punishment."
"When out for a meal, I unscrew the top of the salt shaker and leave it loose on the top before I leave. I never get to experience the carnage this causes as the next patrons to use it go to season their meals but it hasn't stopped me and my 15 year reign of condiment-based terror"
"I scan the self service Costa machines in Tesco, petrol stations etc, to collect the beans on the Costa app, without buying the drink. I then go and redeem my free drink reward in an actual Costa. It's a bit petty but life's about the small wins."
I once read an article about a woman who said 'yes' to anyone who asked her out on a date for a year. That week a guy asked me out at a bar. I didn't fancy him at all but I remembered the article and said yes. We've been married 7 years. I've never told him.
In the 90s when Wash & Go was launched in the UK free samples were supposed to get delivered with the post. Let's just say this postman still has great hair and will do for many years to come. Sorry P&G.
I regularly log into my ex's Netflix and skip episodes so he loses his place
I had a paper round as a teenager and one of the houses had a monthly delivery of 'Fiesta' magazine. It always got posted through the door 24 hours after I was given it.
"When I was young & unemployable due to lack of work experience, a job application wanted 3 references, so I made up a pseudonym & email address for 1 of them. I thought it would be more realistic if I didn't give too glowing a reference. Didn't get the job."

Whilst working in an office i wrote an entire thriller movie script over a 9 month period. People who worked with me thought i was extremely hardworking as they couldnt see through my screen overlay.
"Offered a price for something on FB. He accepted but when I asked for his address a couple of hours later, he said he'd since sold it. So I used a burner account to arrange to buy something else from him and just didn't turn up."
"For the past 15 months, every time I pop a spot or boil I have stored the white nucleus in a little Tupperware tub in my fridge. Each time I get gunk out of me, I add it to the pot. It's half full now. I don't know what to do with it when it's full."
"Taking advantage of a '25% off' sale, I bought some expensive jewellery but was served by a very young shop attendant who worked out the maths and sold it to me for the 25% rather than 75% figure. I didn't correct her and got the bargain of the century."
I pretended to have a limp whilst I was getting off the bus once to avoid having to give my seat to an old lady
Obviously I despise Dominic Cummings like anyone sensible… BUT I'm in love with his voice. Sometimes I put his seven hour parliamentary committee grilling on before I go to bed just to help me drift off to sleep peacefully
I once went to a pizza restaurant and the waitress asked if I'd like my pizza cut into 4 or 8 slices. I replied 4 cos I wasn't sure I could eat 8. Pretty sure that's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
Sometimes I send my kids to pre or after school club just to get rid of the noisy little fuckers.

"Two kids scratched their names into a desk in my classroom. After the class had left I got a compass and scrawled, suck each other's cocks underneath."
I work for a large company in recruitment. If two candidates are pretty much level at the end of the recruitment stage we will choose based on tiny things. Recently we chose one over another because one had greasier hair and we were worried they would smell in the office.
"I put all the paintings and drawings my 5 year old brings home from school each day, in the bin - because they're rubbish. I've done this for the last two years."
"I bought a flat it had an electricity meter. I had no idea who the electricity was with, so I kept putting a pound in the meter. Eventually it was full, so I broke it open and just started using the same pound coin over and over. That was 15 years ago & it's still working today."
I accidentally reversed my partners brand new car into a concrete post and made quite a big dent. The next day they went shopping and when getting back in the car noticed the dent and presumed that it had happened on the carpark. This was 10 years ago and I'm still in the clear.
Me and my wife have been struggling for 8 years to have a baby. On my birthday my wife asked me to make a wish as I blew out the candles on my cake and asked if I made a wish. I did. I wished for Arsenal to finish 4th so we can buy a world class striker in the summer.

"For years I signed up for samples of mens incontinence products and erectile disfunction info in my ex fiancé's name, and put the address as all the social clubs and sports clubs he hung out at after he cheated on me. It cheered me up."
"Self employed, work from home. Just taken a hot desk in a virtual office because the wife now works from home too. It's the only way our marriage will last until the kids leave home."
Every morning I stand on our digital scales in front of the toilet and watch my weight decrease as I go for my morning pee
For many years my son believed he could change the car radio volume by raising or lowering his hand but it was me using steering wheel controls.
I started an unexpectedly popular local 'festival' to launder some cash. Still going ten years later. Hate organising the bloody thing. Karma I suppose.
"I buy the Big Issue from a lovely woman outside a local shop. But when I haven't got cash on me, or have bought it earlier in the week, I can't face the awkwardness or shame of not buying. So if I see her outside, I turn the car around and drive to a different shop."
We had a boss who was pure evil. It was thought because she wasn't getting any. One person had a mate who said he would sort this for a price. The entire office threw in £5 each. Deed got done. She was nice as pie for a few weeks.
"Wife insists on decluttering only through giving on Gumtree, even the smallest shit. It takes too long. I make fake accounts, arrange for things to be left for pickup and throw them away without her knowledge."
"Whenever I go into Curry's or PC World I set all the PC's and tablets to my company website, had loads of good feedback, new customers and not a single complaint. Fuck paid advertising."
"During a teenage sleepover on the coach at my friend's parents, in the middle of the night, I had a sudden urge for a dump. Not wanting to go upstairs, I shat in their kitchen sink, flushed it down and wiped my arse on a dishcloth which I chucked out the window onto their lawn."
"My stepdad's mother hated me, probably because I'm gay. When she died, only I afford to pay for a funeral. She asked to be cremated in her favourite outfit, so I had her buried, in the nightie she died in. There's also a photo album, just of pics of me, in the casket with her"
One night after a few beers I found my girlfriend's electric hair straightening iron in her bathroom. She heard me giggling through the door and burst in to find me straightening my pubes. Hard to believe she still married me a few years later.
"When is was 15, I discovered a VHS tape of a my parents having a sex a party with 2 other couples. Sold it for £5 and some panini stickers. World Cup special edition stickers, I am not an idiot."
"My wife leaving one Saturday told me I'd better paint the porch before I do anything else that day. I dabbed some turps on the carpet for the smell and changed the bulb from 40 watt to 60 watt, then went golfing. She was that impressed I got sex that night."
I went to a Chinese restaurant for the first time and thought the little bowl of water with a lemon in it was to dip your prawn crackers in - embarrassed when I learned it was to wash your fingers.
"When my mum was dying of cancer, she kept getting upset that her daffodil bulbs weren't sprouting. I snuck a daffodil from the park into the pot one day while she was sleeping. She was so happy, and I'm so glad I got to make a little magic for her before she died."

I spent two minutes asking my old Alexa what the time was before I realised it was the kitchen roll.
I reply to my wife's love you messages with I Luv U2 . This is becuase I don't love her but I do love the rock band U2. She doesn't realise my text refers to 4 aging rockers and not her.
When we have steak in garlic butter for dinner - a rare treat - I'll tell my wife I don't want any help cleaning up afterwards and send her off to go relax. Then I take some bread and use it to eat all the lovely burnt garlic butter in the bottom of the pan without judgement.
"Spent £2700 on a new matress, and I can't admit to my wife that I wake up with a back ache everyday. Maybe she does too and we both can't admit that we've wasted so much money."
"When I've finished making supper, if my spouse is nowhere to be seen, as is often the case, rather than phone them - they never answer - I set the smoke alarm off."
"Working from home is brilliant…had a large measure of brandy in my lunchtime coffee today, could never of done that in the office."
"When walking along pavement, I'll speed up if someone tries to overtake me. Making them walk faster and faster. All the while ignoring them. They rarely succeed in passing me."
I drank 2 bottles of Prosecco in 2 hours on a night out once and I needed to vomit urgently but couldn't get to the toilet in time so I puked in the jacket hood of the girl in front of me. I then dropped to the floor and crawled out of the club before anyone noticed.
My husband is on his way home from work. My one year old is smelling very suspicious. I think i'll wait 15 minutes for him to get home and notice
"I technically shouldn't have a degree. I failed my classes in a semester abroad and my home uni didn't pick up on that. Never said a word and last year my diploma came through the door, thanks I guess."
"Whenever I need to transfer money into someone else's account, I always name the transaction BIG RON'S DILDOS…"
"When the kids were learning their times tables, they asked what was the highest I knew. I wowed them with the 17 times table. It was what I used to distract myself and delay orgasm while fucking my wife."
"We lived above a restaurant called, let's say, X. Their cleaners woke us up one night so I changed our WiFi name to X free broadband, ask for password. I forgot about it. Eight years later when we moved out I remembered and felt a bit guilty."
"I often tell my boss and coworkers I have a ton of emails to get through. In reality, I receive maybe five a day and regularly ignore most of them."
"I'm not sure I really know the difference between David Lynch, David Cronenberg, and David Byrne, despite claiming to be a fan of all three. In my head they're all just this weird guy with white hair."

"About 16 years ago I lived in a flat share, where I was the only one who bought toilet roll. When I moved out, some weeks later I broke into the flat and stole all their toilet roll as recompense. We're still friends but I've never told them."

"If I ever struggle to sleep, I go through the current starting eleven of my most recent football manager save. My partner thinks I've been learning mindfulness techniques but I'm arguing over left backs in my head."
"We are some of best customers of our local corner shop. We use them all the time. In reality, 50% of the time we only duck into the corner shop, to avoid our really annoying neighbours. Since we moved to the area, we've eaten so much Bombay mix."
"I have to put on tomorrows clothes for at least 15 mins the day before to break them in. I absolutely hate how washed clothes feel, especially jeans."
"When I was young, they were building housing estates near where I lived to extend the town. We used to sneak into the nearly finished houses and leave a shit in the loft. Used to save it all day to make a robust log."
At university I used to piss into the water compartment of my roommates iron. He would unknowingly be shooting steaming piss through his jeans before a night out to decrease them. Never found out.
"I used to squirt shampoo into my hand at Tesco on the walk back from uni, and walk home and straight into the shower with it clasped there, to save having to waste money on it."
"When ever me and my best mate went to house parties we would superglue at least one thing down. Once we found a mate's mum's dildo under her bed so glued it to the car bonnet in the garage, knowing no one would see it until his parents came home."
"Before every shit I take, I put a single square of loo roll into the bowl. Not only does it prevent splashing, but it guarantees you'll notice if the roll is about to run out before it's too late."
"In the course of bringing up the kids, they had a goldfish which 'lived' for six and a half years, cats who changed sex and even one time a hamster miraculously changed colour. Wife, says the back garden is like Pet Sematery while inside it's like Weekend at Bernie's."
"When I was 11 my older sister was dating our paperboy. Everytime he delivered our newspaper he'd put a cadbury's creme egg inside it for my sister, but I'd always await the delivery and eat it before she found it. She always thought he was lying about posting them."
"When I was 15 I woke up really thirsty after drinking cheap 'Electric White' cider. The house I grew up in was really cold, didn't want to get up so drank my hot water bottle water. Rubbery & refreshing, fell back to sleep no problem."
"When I was about 8 or 9 I loved Lego so much that my Mum made me a moonscape from paper mache so I could stage my creations. But because it wasn't the proper Lego moonscape, I took it down the back yard and destroyed it. Sorry Mum.... this still haunts me 40 years on"
A secret I'll take to my grave... I'm absolutely sexually attracted to cars. I've never done anything with a car so to speak but it's what I have to imagine to be able to have sex. Been the same long as I can remember. My porn folder is cars. I'm so ashamed
"Every night in bed, without fail, my girlfriend and I reverse into each other and ritualistically touch bums just before we nod off. It's the most important part of our routine. I wish I could tell everyone how happy it makes me but I'd sound a bit weird."
"FROM ADMIN: If you fancy bunging me some pennies for the time I (@robmanuel) spend running this account it would be much appreciated, it's become a monster and taken over my life. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"In online meetings, I sometimes sketch caricatures of my colleagues faces. No one knows. I look like I'm concentrating and taking notes."

"My partner complained I don't do enough around the house. Started telling her when I do things; aside from that I haven't changed my routine at all, but she's started singing my praises, and even told me to sit down and relax earlier."
"Wiped the thick coating of mud off the number plate on someone else's parked car today. If they were using it so that they could ignore the speed cameras, then I hope they enjoy getting some tickets."
"I have been with my wife nearly two decades. I met a girl who is a lesbian and we became really close in the pandemic. We go on strictly platonic dates, doing all the shit my wife has no interest in, without telling anyone, and I love it."
"In my first year at uni, I ran out of money. While collecting my mail in halls of residence, I saw what looked like a birthday card for someone else. I guessed it might have money in it and stole it. 50 quid from a fellow students parents to their son. Felt guilty ever since."
When handing my 5mnth old infant son a rattle to play with I'll say shake it baby in the style of Duke Nukem in Duke Nukem 3D giving dollar bills to strippers to flash their tits. Wife has no idea what it's from and has started to say it too.
"Walking around clothes shops with the wife, it was cold outside and I had chapped lips so asked her 'have you got any Vaseline?', the girl I had been following for the last few minutes turned round looking shocked. It wasn't my wife."
Bought a dishwasher with a silver front on it and had it delivered. It was only when I opened it that it was gold fronted. Was angry but wasn't worth the hassle of waiting for replacement. A year later I realized it was silver with gold protective wrap I never removed.
"At school breaktime a friend & I sabotaged a teacher's lesson by recording over the French recorded on the magnetic strip of the cards they'd prepared. Instead of French, the teacher put the card in the machine & it played us screaming - class burst into laughter"
"After going to a gig and trying to get out quickly, I always shout 'lady with a baby' and people create space for me get straight out. Works every time."
Rented my house out while I moved abroad for work. Tenants stopped paying after 3 months and took about a year to evict them and haven't seen a penny owed. Going through post afterwards saw a cheque with a £1k+ rebate from HMRC for one of them. I tore it up and binned it.
"At one of my first jobs I had access to the petty cash at work, I borrowed some to pay rent. A security agency was brought in to run polygraphs. I beat the machine. Turns out an accounting girl had been defrauding the company. Never sweated so much in my life."
"When I was younger, I used to think everybody else was a robot and that I was the only human on the planet. I finally put this idea to bed for good when my first child was born. I was 34"
"Back when I was skint I used to go into my local bookshop, grab some expensive-looking books from the shelves downstairs then take them upstairs to the second-hand department and flog them. Always got a decent price - easiest money I ever made"
"Years ago my daughter was obsessed with sims, I tried to create my own game with added adult content I'd found online. Couldn't work it out and logged off bored. She chose a pink dress for her sim a few days later and when it sat down the dress rode up and showed a hairy m..."
Split with the Mrs a few months ago as she was seeing someone else who she's now moved into our marital home. I still have the hive heating app on my phone. I keep turning up to maximum when they go to work. Hope it's costing them a fortune.
I used to play hide & seek with my toddlers; they'd go upstairs and hide and I'd just sit down with a cuppa and randomly shout out 'I'm coming!! Where are you?! Oh no you're not there!' To make them think I was looking for them. Worked a treat for.a peaceful 15 mins.

When I was younger I ate a pot noodle and left the pot on the floor next to the settee a little while later my dad sat there and picked his psoriasis scab and placed it in empty pot not long after my brother saw some left over bits in the pot noodle pot and proceeded to eat scabs
"Sometimes, when my girlfriend is feeling down and stuck in a loop of making herself miserable I will deliberately misspell words when texting because she will laugh at me for being thick and it cheers her up a little"
My wife keeps deleting the browser history and cookies on my iPad after watching porn. The only reason I know is my Wordle streak keeps resetting and it's getting frustrating.
"As a kid I loved eating beetroot, until one day my Dad told me they were little creatures that ran around in fields and farmers would shoot them and shove them into little jars - hence the red liquid. I'm now 42 years old and I've never ate it since."
"I was once duped into visiting a brothel by a group of friends after a night out. Not up my street at all. After each friend had gone into a room with one of the ladies, I spent the night sitting with the madam drinking tea and watching repeats of Catchphrase. I had a great time!"
"Once read how spies set up false ID in case they need to disappear. I tried it and it worked. I have an alter ego that I maintain complete with birth certificate, passport etc just in case. I'm 45 and work in a call centre."
Men really annoy me when it comes to pooing. Why can't they just go about their business quietly like women? My boyfriend has to describe the absolute scenes that have just occurred or bigger than King Kong's finger that. I don't care.
Whenever I eat buckwheat for breakfast I scroll twitter and pretend I'm a Soviet schoolchild in a dank concrete apartment reading yesterday's Pravda

"Mate was gutted when he found out his long term girlfriend was shagging a bloke from her work. As retribution we all took turns shitting in a bin liner for a week, then one night we threw it all over the front of what turned out to be some other poor cunt's house."
"My Dutch girlfriend sucked me off, then spat it into a pan and fried it."
"It's not really a confession, more an unburdening."
"I honestly think I would forgive my partner if she cheated on me, but if she leaves a pair of yoga pants one leg in, one leg out or a balled up pier of socks one more time for me to hang up, she is gone"
When I was young I fully believed I would like indie and dance music forever and no other music genres would ever compete. Fast forward 20 years and now I'm in my mid 40s I can't enough country music into my ears. I fear I'll be line dancing before I'm 50.
My laziness has peaked washing up often left for few days in the sink. Went over a week couldn't be bothered to wash up just ordered more plates & bowls online.
"I like licking my own skin and then blowing it dry with my breath because it creates a vinegary smell that I find appealing. I tend to do this in Teams calls without knowing it, but someone recently told me they've seen me doing it and ask me could I stop."
"In my early 20s I accidentally found a jazz mag under my dad's mattress, borrowed it and put it back. Dad and I 'shared' that classic smut for years. He passed a few years ago but it's genuinely one of the few things we probably had in common - miss you dad."
"I always book Any Time Return train tickets with work. Then when I get home I check to see if any trains were significantly delayed on my route, then claim I was on that service and get the refund paid directly to myself."
"Postman here, saw a cat trying to get into a window so helped him in, and pushed the window closed. Two weeks later, homeowners came back from holiday, to a load of shit everywhere and a dead cat. It wasn't their cat. Sorry."
I'm a militant atheist. But I really love choral evensong. Often pretend to be a Christian so I can attend it.
"Before lockdown I used to change my socks every day without fail, couldn't bear to put the same pair on twice. Now I'll wear the same pair for 5 or 6 days without flinching."
"Since we got a dog who now sleeps on our bed we have virtually no sex like to speak of. The dog is great, but I wouldn't have chosen her if I'd have known. My wife, however, doesn't seem to care."
I recently had a circumcision. I was advised to take it easy for a week but had tickets for a gig I really wanted to go to. Halfway through it became clear the wound had opened and I had to take the embarrassing step of scrounging a panty liner from a bar maid.
In the 90s when i first heard of jungle referred to as drum & bass i thought the guy was saying 'Drummond Bass' like it was some mad Scottish thing. Quietly corrected myself a few months later and never told no one
"I have a successful comedy content Twitter account. I'm followed by several prominent Tory MPs, Harry Cole, Lord Frost & Laurence Fox. I don't follow them back, as they're all massive cunts, but I've not blocked them, as collectively, they've got a lot of followers. Every cloud"
"Im 41, married with 4 kids, fit and financially secure, but the single greatest achievement of my life was last year when searching for a pair of matching socks I snapped, took out my phone and ordered a box of 200 pairs of heavy duty PLAIN BLACK socks. Then trashed all the rest."

"On a snowy, drunken night out in Canterbury in the early nineties I pushed a really lovely rowing boat into the river outside The Millers Arms and watched it float away. I have harboured this guilt for years and often wondered whether it was ever found."
"Aged 6 or 7 I did the Spot the Ball competition in the paper with my Dad, sticking a pin in the page where I thought the concealed football should. My Dad told me I would have guessed correctly when I heard a PFFFT noise. I was 30 when I realised I'd been had"
"As a young teen when I first started masterbating, I used to whipe my cum on my curtains, for weeks and weeks this happened. A few months later my curtain snapped it was that crusty. I had to put my curtains in the bin and my mum never asked where they were"
My brother found a laptop on a train and planned to sell it to a mate of mine. I changed the screen saver to come on after 15 secs with the words This Laptop is fitted with a tracking device. Police are aware of it's location He threw it in the canal in a panic. Thieving twat.
"Bored as a child in shops I was amazed to discover packets of spare buttons inside pockets of clothes. Decided to swap them over between different outfits. If you brought an item from C&A or M&S in Bournemouth in the 80's & had the wrong buttons, that would be me."
"About 20 years ago I dumped this girl because I didn't particularly like her. She continued to email me erotic messages and once, feeling bored and horny, I replied and we went out and ended up having sex. Four kids later we're still together, and I still don't like her."

Every time we do the food shopping we buy mini cocktail sausages as training treats for our Springer Spaniel. I always eat most of them and my wife can't understand why the dog is so badly behaved.
"We had horribly cruel neighbours. Their long haired cat was matted, bony and always shut outside. She would cry on our windowsill in the rain. After months of this, we catnapped her to live with my grandma. She got brushed, trimmed, gained healthy weight and lived happy."
I once shit myself at an outdoor trampoline park when I was 13. I shook the poo nugget out of my shorts and it bounced onto another kids trampoline and kept getting flung about. I've never trampolined since.
"My gf is 10/10 beautiful, funny, kind and just an amazing person. But appalling at sex. My ex was incredible in bed but not a particularly nice person. It's a nightmare, I didn't realise what really good sex meant to me."
"I have a sign on my front door saying please leave shopping in porch, we have COVID. We're all COVID free and it's brilliant at making door-to-door salespeople skip our house and try the next one down."
My ex-wife and I wrote our own vows. I quoted Hamlet's letter to Ophelia: do not doubt that I love. But I hadn't written anything until the week before the wedding when I watched the sons of anarchy series finale where it was quoted at the end.
"Sometimes when I'm in bed and I need to fart, I'll seperate my bum cheeks out so the gas passes making a hiss sound rather than the whole horn arrangement"
I once took a boyfriend to IKEA to instigate an argument so he would break up with me.
"Whenever I have moved into a new house, it takes me two to three months before I can comfortably masturbate in there."
"At a Catholic Primary school I went to, once in a while we were made to do private confession to a priest. I'll never forget my confession when I was 8 years old was I bully my cat. The priest actually laughed at me."

"Next to my house is a giant statue of a cockerel and without my family's knowledge, I like to get outrageouly high and pay it a visit. I often ride it as though it's falkor from the neverending story. This has been going on for 5+ years and no ones aware yet."
"Home alone, I used my Son's VR headset to view porn. Upon completion I removed the headset but couldn't locate the ejaculate. The 15 mins fruitlessly searching my bedroom in a panic wasn't worth the orgasm."
"I once lied to a teacher about submitting a project for my design class. I was quiet and well behaved so he believed me and even said I'm sure I looked at it, he felt so guilty he spent his lunch break for three days writing out a new one for me, which I then used an got an A."
"I live in a moderately posh village, but I, and others, have rumbled the house where the local drug dealers live. Youths waiting patiently outside at all hours. It is breathtakingly exciting."
"I bought my husband flowers today, because I was saddened to read online, That men only get flowers when they die. And I thought that was pretty sad and true for most. He said he was happy because no-one has ever done it for him."
Found a wallet long ago. Stuffed with cash. Owner easily found on social media. Read his posts & it was full of abuse about the football team I support. Booked a weekend away at a swanky hotel. Proposed to the girl that is now my wife.
"I got an alert someone else was using my Spotify account, so I kept changing the song they were listening to, to 'I cum Blood' by Cannibal Corpse. A few hours later, I realised I hadn't reset the Google home device I'd sold to an old lady."
Years ago at a toy shop with my 3 year old son. I hid from him and put on one of those scary Scream ghost masks and then jumped out at him. He absolutely freaked out in abject terror and ran away screaming in utter fright. Unfortunately I'd jumped out at someone else's kid.
"In my work office, if I turn the lock on the toilet just enough it stays unlocked but appears engaged from outside. I always do this, in an attempt to keep usage of my favourite cubicle low."
Had a drink with the neighbours one night and we ended up having a threesome. He immediately regretted it so I make sure I give him a wink and a nod when I put my bins out. I'm king of my street.
"Having sex with other people makes me fancy the wife more. Can't really explain it - just puts me in a sexy state of mind I suppose. If not for my many side flings, our sex life would have dried up years ago and we'd probably be separated."
I gave a homeless guy £20 one winters day. I found out the next day he had overdosed during the night. I have been riddled by guilt that I facilitated his death.
"Used to work as a manager in a pub. Managed to work out after a long period of time when the fruit machine on average was going to payout. So at the end of the night, I would take £10 from the till and play it. 9/10 times I'd win the jackpot and put the £10 back."
In the 80s I worked for the civil service and we had flexitime . You could build up a day's flexi leave by working an extra 23 minutes each day. I never had a dump at home and once a month I had a day off which I had earned by getting in early and shitting there.
"I never let my kids beat me at anything, sports, board games, quizzes whatever. I'm aware this could be damaging their confidence but I can't help myself"
"Every single day on Facebook, a friend of mine posts a photo of whichever vinyl record he's listening to, alongside a strategically placed cappuccino - complete with Biscoff biscuit - and I fantasise about killing him."

My wife bought a dash cam for our car. I didn't know it recorded the sound in the car. She now has lots of recordings of me pretending to be interviewed by sky sports as manager of my FIFA team while driving to work. Mortifying.
"At an amusementpark I won a teddy bear for my son by scooping balls into a basket. Too late I realized all my contestants were kids, some who never got the chance to make their first attempt. The looks I got, especially from their parents, still makes me feel so ashamed."
"When I started secondary school, the dinner ladies would allow you buy as many leftover chips as you wanted at the end of the day. I have never experienced such non-sexual ecstasy as I did from this moment. Even the thought of it gave me a semi."
"I once wrote a quick basic program on a ZX spectrum in my local Tandy's asking users to enter a 3 digit number, and no matter what number you entered a message appeared saying you won the computer."
"Binge watched After Life with my wife, and spent the majority in floods of tears. She was constantly consoling me, and reassuring me that she's going nowhere. It went on for too long for me to admit that it was the thought of losing our dog that was upsetting me."
"I am an orchestral conductor, and I often use my very expensive baton as a backscratcher."
"My wife complains I never buy her flowers anymore, but that's because all that happens afterwards is that I get told to put them in a vase, and then told I've done a shit job arranging them."
"My class was assigned a very poor physics teacher. He couldn't control the boys and we were learning nothing. After a few weeks, the girls sent a demand to the headmaster to give us a better teacher. He agreed. We were 13. Still feel sorry for the bad teacher though."
"I work in a well known car part and bike retailer and whenever I have to deal with an arrogant or entitled customer I make sure to give them the grimiest, most horrible change from the till. Makes me feel as if I've had the last laugh."
"Saw a bloke obviously drunk driving on dual-carriageway. Stayed behind. Came off at my junction and pulled over for a piss. Double-backed, he was still pissing, took his keys - still in ignition - and lobbed them as far as I could into a field. Shopped him to the police."
I had a cry for 30 minutes this morning while listening to Brian Eno's Apollo because I know I'll never get to go to space.
"Now that I finally have money to buy console games, I'm too old to enjoy them anymore. I'm gutted."
"My husband works away one week in four and I send him saucy videos while he's away. He delights in telling me how much smaller he made the file with his favourite compression software, so I make sure the files are extra big so he feels extra good."
"Got caught in bed with someone's wife and obviously had to leave quickly, but was genuinely more annoyed that I'd left behind a packet of skittles and a bottle of coke."
"I like to stop the microwave with 1 second to go. Then, I listen out for my girlfriend as she goes into the kitchen, huffs, and presses cancel. My record is 8 times in 1 day."
"When opening the deadbolts on the front door of a morning, I sometimes pretend I'm the landlord of the Queen Vic having had to shout we're closed then angrily opening them for whoever's still knocking"

Sometimes I pretend to snore so my partner will kick me onto the sofa downstairs because the sofa is comfier than the bed
I've disabled all screensavers on my computers since I've owned them and never has my screen broke
"I repair mobile phones for a major supplier and some of the pictures and videos people have are VERY questionable. And yes, we always look."
My GF bought me some EarPods for Christmas. I've subsequently lost one a month since and had to re buy the same ones. It may cripple me financially.
"I secretly think that the Christian Bale movie Equilibrium depicts a paradise, I would love to live in that world and not have to feel any emotions. More trouble than they're worth frankly"
"When I'm trying to have a piss but being thwarted by shy bladder, I do multiplications in my head to distract myself. Works every time."
I talk to my Dad every day. I take him with me when I go fishing each week and I ask his opinion on career and personal decisions. He almost always provides a sensible answer. He died in 1974.
My dad recorded my mum's voicemail greeting message on her mobile phone. He sadly passed away 2 years ago. I always feel emotional when I ring her and she does not pick-up the call.
"Whenever I got the emergency row leg room seat on long haul flights, whilst people were boarding I would open up the peanuts from the seats next to me and spill a few across the them, and open the blankets and spread them out so it looked like the seats were taken."
"In 20 years of illegal torrent downloading, I've not once left my completed file on the network to upload and share/seed with anyone else. "
"Once I've got it, everyone else can piss off."
"My wife cancels payments to council tax, mortgage, gas, water to spend on non-essentials. We're £40k in debt and I have no idea what to do."
I've lived alone for a while https://t.co/KJaGJ2AMTn personal habits are getting odd. I worry that if I bring someone home I'm going to forget and rub my feet together like a demented grasshopper as I get into bed to get dirt off. Already got caught kneeling to pee by one lady
"My girlfriend insists she 'can't' drink tap water because it tastes different to bottled water. I have over the past couple of months intermittently poured out the contents of open bottles of Volvic from the fridge and filled it with tap water, she has never noticed."
"My stepdad passed away last year. My mum was heartbroken so I had to go through his stuff and I found a list of like 20 passwords. Turns out he was having an online affair on various dating sites for the past few years. Never told her, would've broken her heart."
Whenever my wife annoys me I look through the last chapter of the book she's reading so I know the ending before her. I don't spoil it for her but it makes me feel better.
When I was 10 the teacher said that the art mural on the wall was made of rice paper. Shouldn't have said something was edible if he didn't expect someone to eat it should he?

I once hooked up with a girl and afterwards she literally went 'well that wasn't very good'. Crushed my confidence and I haven't really enjoyed sex since. So thanks for that.
"My girlfriend and I started a business during lockdown and I regret it. I hate being self-employed, I miss knowing exactly what I'm getting paid. She doesn't like the way I work and constantly tells me. I want to quit to save the relationship but I think I would lose it anyway."
"I recently bought some Peppa Pig kids toilet roll from Lidl. Not to encourage my 2 year old to use the toilet, it's because I fucking hate Peppa Pig and I can't wait to have a shit so I can smear my turd all over her face with every wipe"
"I don't want to admit that I stock-piled during the height of the pandemic with all those other losers who queued round Sainsburys car park with their trolleys, but I've only just had to buy my first pack of bog rolls since circa June 2020."
"I apply the airline safety instruction, which states you should fit your own lifejacket on before attempting to fit your child's, to making lunch. It's better I'm fully fed and watered before making theirs so I do a much better job of it."
"I pretend to the missus that my electric car needs somebody to sit in it for at least an hour daily with the key to charge it up. It is the best hour of my day, I just watch Netflix on the drive away from her and the kids."
"My 13 year old son keeps pestering me to wrestle. I constantly make excuses such as I twinged my back this morning, or the dog is in the room and she would get too excited. Truth is I am scared he will beat me now."
"The state of my marriage is so bad that I get more satisfaction shampooing the carpet than through sex. However, I can't leave her in case I lose access to the Vax"
I work in a call centre for a major company. If I take a disliking to the way a customer is speaking to me I will simply cut them off. But I do it mid sentence so it sounds like an accident/technical glitch. I take extra pleasure from this when wait times are 30 minutes plus.
"I have occasional rogue hairs grow from the outer edges of my ears, and I bemoan their persistence despite diligent plucking. The most coarse culprit however has recently ceased reappearing, and I actually miss the little guy."
"There are 2 Recycling Centres near to my house. One is 4.2 Miles away, the other is 8.7 Miles away. Sometimes, I just drive to the one 8.7 Miles away as it feels illicit, the only form of affair I can manage at 38."
"One of my worst sexual experiences was with a lad who made the most awful noise when he went down on me. It was like a retching, growling, hungry roar. It was 25 year ago, but I sometimes still remember and cringe."
Finished a cup of tea. Needed a piss. Couldn't be bothered to go upstairs to the bathroom. Pissed in the cup. Forgot about it. About 20 minutes later took a sip from the cup thinking it was tea. Tasted alright to be fair.
"I once covered my knob in hot sauce and had a wank, just to see what it would be like. The pain was so bad I thought about calling an ambulance, before realising how embarrassing that would have been."
I was in my late 20s when I discovered that not getting my cycling proficiency when I was 12 didn't mean I wasn't allowed to cycle down the high street
My brother has always been a real shit brother. Brushed his whole family aside even when my father was going through cancer during lockdown. So now and again I make sure to get as much junk mail sent to his email address as possible. He's had to change his email 4 times already.

I fear that my life peaked in 1986 when I received help from Gordo Greatbelly in the Adventure section of Sinclair User
I read history books as a child; particularly interested in WW2. I believed for the following 10 years that the 'phoney war' and 'post war' periods were separate wars fought over the telephone and by the Royal Mail.
"I'm proud of myself for finally getting around to deleting 90% of the porn I've been amassing for over a decade, but gutted that I can't tell anyone my accomplishment."
"I'm in love with one of the girls I work with, she is so engaged and has a child and I know we will never be together but I'm in love with her, we have a good friendship too and call each other work husband and work wife"
"I was chatting to a colleague after starting a new job. Have you met Nathan? she asked. I said yes and described him as a 'likeable idiot' who 'I wouldn't trust him to tie his own shoelaces'. Conversation over, Nathan was her son."
"My partner stays with her grampa a couple of times a week as his carer, I told her I had covid so she would stay with him and I'd have 10 days peace and quiet. I didn't have covid."
"I was happy tipsy on a night out and went to the bathroom and there was an empty pint glass sitting in one of the individual urinals. I filled it perfectly to the brim, it looked exactly like a beer, slight froth. I left it for someone else to deal with. Chuffed with myself."
"When my ex partner would snore so loudly I couldn't sleep, I'd record him and set it as his cell phone ringer tone."
"I have two spots on either side of my chin. If I touch them both simultaneously, it's like doing a screenshot."
I can't remember the colour of my partner's eyes despite being with her for 19 years. I could check a photo of have a good look but I never remember to. I live in daily fear of her asking me.
"My partner and I have been together for 7 years. When he has really annoyed me, I loosen all the strings on his guitar. He thinks there's something wrong with it and talks about getting a new one. Has no idea it's me."
"As a student waiting at a bus station, a kid gave me a tenner and asked me to buy fags for him. I went into the shop, pretended to queue up and then sneaked out of the opposite entrance. Walked back to campus to go drinking with the money."
"Data-entry clerk for a bank in the 90s, would search for rude names in to the database. The best ones were Fred Muff, Nicholas Cretin, Melanie Munter and Ivor Slapper. Also a Japanese customer called Norohito Shite. Data protection not so strict back then."
"When I was 11 I faked a sore tummy to get out of going to school - I was dreading a drama skit thing. I ramped up my complaints over the weekend. On Monday my mum kept me off school and took me to the GP, GP sent us straight to the hospital where I had my appendix removed."
"A lad at work knocked into me while I was carrying several mugs of tea, causing minor spillage. He didn't apologise, just gave me a dismissive look and walked off. This was 8 years and 3 jobs ago, but I will hate him until the heat death of the universe."
When I was young and exceptionally clueless I paid a cheer-up visit to a colleague in hospital. In the labour ward. While she was in labour. Astonishingly she did not want to see me. I have no idea why I thought this was in any way socially appropriate. It still makes me cringe.

"On the night of the Live 8 convert in 2005, I to the pub. Arriving home later I asked the missus how the concert was. She said OK except three old guys covering The Scissor Sisters, Comfortably Numb. This wasn't in the divorce proceedings, but this is why they happened."
I'm a bit embarrassed to admit I have an interest in Air-raid sirens. Ive installed a live map to go around hunting them down and listening to them when they're being tested annually. I get such an adrenaline rush! I'm a 27 year old woman and I feel I should be 60.
I've been a journalist for 23 years and the only word I can never spell is diarrhoea. I have three young kids so have had to type it on countless occasions but still never get it correct without googling it. Had to do that to type this confession.
I was the one who put graffiti all over my school saying I was the best kisser.
"I was waiting to use the bathroom at a party once, and couldn't believe how long it was taking. Eventually, a line of 12 or so people had formed behind me. Finally I tried the handle. Door hadn't been locked, the room was empty. I'd been holding everyone up 20 minutes."
"I once took myself to A&E for what I thought was a heart attack. After a half day of tests, lying in a hospital bed and being on a drip, it turns out it was indigestion from a microwave rustlers hamburger I had the night before."
I was a Tube driver on the District Line. A regularly obnoxious chap used to get on the back of the train at Richmond and run down to the front at Stamford Brook. I used to wait for him to get almost to the front and then shut the doors and piss off.
"On the occasions my wife is feeling horny she'll say We could have sex tonight? before she goes to work. This is helpful as I then know not to have a wank before she comes home, although that could also be why she says it."
"I have just had to make a secret 30 mile round trip to replace my wife's M&S milk chocolate coated Brazil nuts as I ate them all. Bonus, I had to eat a few from the new pack to make it look like the pack I'd eaten."
"When the tooth fairy is arriving for an unexpected tooth loss, I use change from the kids piggy banks because I never have any change. Kids think they are loaded."
"Saved on my phone I have lots of voicemails from my mum, from the years before she died suddenly in 2019. I desperately want to hear her voice again but I'm scared to listen because I think they'll show that I was a bad son who rarely phoned her. All she wanted was to speak to me"
"I've inherited a beautiful signet ring that's been passed down the generations from 18th century aristocracy. However, whenever I have a wank, I can't help but think about my dad who must have also wanked wearing the ring. It's not ideal."
"I brokered the truce between my girlfriend and her long-estranged parents, and now they're on talking terms. I thought the situation was overblown, but she was right. Having now met them, I can see that they are intolerable twats. I wish I hadn't bothered."
"When wanking on a saturday, I jizz straight into the sheets as saturday is sheet washing day."
"When walking behind people I pretend I'm a race car in their slip stream and overtake at the last moment to get the most benefits from the low air pressure,"
My mother-in-law is so tight. She hates boiling the kettle and asks me through gritted teeth if I'd like a second cup of tea during our weekly visits. I always say yes just to see her sweat as she watches the digits increase on her smart meter. I then let the tea go cold.

I once got arrested after nicking trainers from JD. I got held in custody while they used my keys to search my M&Ds house. They found them and I was cautioned and released. Still stunned my.parents never knew any of this happened. I'd have been kicked out for sure.
"My late Dad was a car and gadget person. It's been 20 years since passed and would have marvelled at the tech that is in my current car. Occasionally when driving alone, I have 'conversations' with him as he is driving it, with him being amazed at all the cool stuff it can do."
When my ex broke up with me he left himself logged in to Facebook on my iPad. I occasionally go through his conversations and delete messages before he reads them. He has missed quite a few important things...
I am a teacher. I love wearing masks. It allows me to mouth profanities at students that annoy me without them knowing.
"I was a catfish for a very long time, my actual life felt like it wasn't worth living so I became a whole different person online for years and it began to consume me. I knew it was wrong but I couldn't see a way out so I faked my catfish's death."
My neighbour is obsessed with his lawn and once reached over and cut the top off my walnut tree claiming it was shading his lawn too much. Every couple of weeks I launch a couple of handfuls of granular weedkiller over the fence.
"Many years ago when I was 26 I had a relationship with an 18 year old acting student. She's now starting to become quite well known now from a TV thing. In all her profiles and publicity and website, even wiki, she fibs about her age. The lies make me a peado."
"My wife thinks we moved house because I wanted a bigger garden. In reality, my neighbour overheard me on a sex chat line and I couldn't face the embarrassment."
"I once woke up after a big night out bursting for a piss in a friend's unfamiliar house. Instead of finding the toilet I pissed in an empty glass. Later, I woke again with the same issue. Faced with limited options I drank the earlier piss and filled up the glass again."
"In 6th form, back in the 80s, I wrote a sketch for the Christmas concert based on the TV quiz show Blockbusters. For the Gold Run scene I filled the superfluous tiles with JP- TIS - AW - AN - KER. JPT was the initials of the Headmster, who sat beaming in the front row."
My wife & I got upgraded due to a problem with the toilet in a swanky London hotel. Didn't own up to the fact I'd done a massive shit which caused said blockage.
Someone cheekily copied the app I made. They are also not a very good programmer. So I was able to create a simple automated function which severely slows down their website many times a day. Still makes me chuckle. Not sorry.
"Drunk one night went for a piss behind a row of shops, found bags of spuds, took one and shoved several up the exhaust pipes of cars in the next road, always wondered if it caused any damage"
"My ex has played the same numbers on the lottery for years, we divorced a couple of years ago and since then I've played 2 lines of the same numbers as they do. If they - I mean we - win the jackpot they'll only get a 1/3 of the jackpot at most."
"When I was a child my parents had a terrible row that lasted days, their marriage was never the same again. Years later it occurred to me that the trigger 'might' have been the packet of strange balloons I found in my dad's wardrobe and threw away after blowing them up."
"I used to be so ashamed that I worked for Department for Transport that I lied to friends and said I worked at the Home Office. Now thanks to Priti, I think I might need a fictional transfer."

Years ago I thumbed a lift from a lorry driver. He was from up North and asked me how to get to Marlborough. I got him to drive past my house to drop me off and then said Carry on ahead and turn right at the crossroads. Marlborough was about 20 miles in the opposite direction.
"As a teen I found some weed in my Dad's room. Stole it, smoked it, thought it was the perfect crime as he could never ask if I'd taken it. Years later he told me he had been near-suicidal during my teens and used to smoke to try to stay on a level. Have never felt guiltier."
I used work for a big global logistics organization and we killed over 1 person a month in traffic accidents over the 8 years I worked there. We hid the global reporting from the big board. Nobody got sacked or disciplined or really gave a shit. Just saying.
"A lovely couple on holiday invited us for a boozy dinner back home. Having a pee, I rummaged in their bathroom cabinet. Out fell a pack of sanitary towels into the toilet bowl of piss. Horrified, I stuffed 26 wet pads into my pants and asked to go home due to a bad tummy."
"When wife & I are preparing to leave her mum's house, and I've got the bus tracker app fired up, I always subtract a 5-7 min cushion between app times & times I announce. If I didn't, their endless cheerios would make us miss the bus. Every single time."
"The previous owners of our house left it in shit state, about 3 tonne of building rubbish in the garden, cooker had to be dumped as it was so filthy."
"We then started to receive letters from debt recovery agents, l happily let them know where the filthy fuckers were now living."
"A mate got in touch promoting their band's new song. I clicked the link and listened, blown away by how good it was, and sent him a gushing text. When I went to play it to my wife I realised that I had accidentally listened to Dreams by Fleetwood Mac. His actual song is shit."
"I got paid to translate a menu from andorran to English. I did it easily and perfectly, the trouble was they couldn't read my hand writing, so wrote onion nugs on 4ft high wall menus I never told them, 3 years later the menu was still up"
I buy trolley tokens for 35p from Home Bargains and when I'm at the supermarket and have loaded up the car I spot someone about to get a trolley and offer mine and take their pound coin.
I'm a teacher. My World's Best Teacher staffroom mug; I bought it for myself.
I illegally stream Gilmore Girls because it's fucking great but id be embarassed if it showed on my Netflix continue watching.
"I once stole multiple suitcases by placing two smaller ones in two larger ones, then swapping the price tags - £80 vs £25. Cashier even commented Ooh, these are cheap aren't they?! Set off the alarm as I left the store and was just waived on. The holiday was shit."
"My quiz team recently won, it was a cash prize. The other members used their phones to cheat. I felt so guilty about it that I donated my winnings to a mental health charity."
I was working freelance for a company and have now started as an employee in another role for them. Due to a mix-up my supervisor doesn't know my freelance work isn't part of my regular duties. So I am doing that during company time and being paid twice. I'm not saying a word.
"When I make toast in the morning I always flip the toast out the toaster and catch it in mid-air as, I imagine, James Bond always does. I usually burn myself but it's worth it to look so monumentally cool."
I don't really like tea. I like biscuits. I only drink tea to make my biscuit habit socially acceptable

My wife asked me what made me suddenly want to have sex. I had to make something up quickly because I couldn't tell her that it was the vibrations from the cat sat on my lap purring.
"I've got my 11yr old daughter involved in burying every foreign coin we get in change, find on the street etc in our back garden in the hope that in a couple of hundred years they are discovered by a very confused archaeologist."
Haven't been to the dentist in 8 years. Putting it off because I'm scared of the bollocking I'll get for not going to the dentist in 8 years.
"Once was having what I thought was a platonic chat in a hotel bar with an attractive woman wearing a wedding band, until she got up to leave, squeezed my thigh and slid me a key card. With no room number. What might have been keeps me up a decade later."
"Both me and my younger brother a 6ft tall, but I keep saying I'm 6'1 because it annoys him, he even brought a tape measure with him at Christmas and I refused to get measured while calling him childish for bringing it."
"However, if you are uncommonly generous, and if you fancy bunging me some coins for my time I'd appreciate it. Kofi link which is basically PayPal. "

FROM @robmanuel: So many great stories coming in this February - so thank you for that. I'm reading them all to pick out the best for this feed - it takes a *lot* of time but I don't mind a bit as reading anecdotes is my favourite thing in the world. Screen grab = over 200 a day! https://t.co/suTrXXsXG9
"I had to teach my middle-aged partner that if he wants the calendar to remind him, he needs to actually add reminders. It's the latest in a long line of issues, and it's seriously affecting my attraction to him."
"Age 13 I stopped picking my nose and eating it, because it's disgusting. Age 36 I started up again, because it's also delicious."
"My wife is 4' 11 and cannot see the top shelf in the cupboards, let alone reach it. That's where I hide the bourbons and that's why I'm not losing weight, despite the diet she's put me on."
"I'm a miserable person, so when I'm in Greggs, if It's busy I'll always buy all the remaining steak bakes or sausage rolls knowing people behind me would have wanted them. I bought 6 steak bakes 2 days ago and watched people waiting for 20 mins while I sat in my car eating them."
"After a stagnant couple of months on tinder, I have decided to take a new approach. I just subtly imply I'm a drug dealer. My shag/match ratio has gone through the roof. I'm not even a dealer, I'm a chartered accountant."
My vile and abusive Mum couldn't wait for my Grandma to die so she inherited all of her money to build herself a ghastly house on her dream plot of land. It was me who submitted the only planning objection using a false name Mum. Not sorry about the planning rejection.
"Not wanting to bother the plasterers who were plastering my stairs, I was desperate for a poo so I went into my garage and shit in a bucket"
"Seeing all these pre-internet masturbation material confessions, I once masturbated to the Teletubbies, focusing particularly on Po."
I had a job interview and during small talk complimented them on their decor. I got a rejection from them almost immediately. They said they needed someone who could tell the difference between a zoom background and reality.
Whenever I order something off Ebay I always google the post office they've sent it from to deem if their post office looks more like a shithole than mine. 90% of the time they look like where dreams go to die
I do all the laundry in our house. I'm so scared of ruining one of my girlfriend's favourite dresses that I've left it in the bottom of the washing basket for over 4 years.

"Got asked to dig a hole to bury a dead Great Dane dog. After what seemed hours of hard digging the hole was too small and the dog wouldn't fit. So got a knife from the kitchen and cut its legs off, neatly stacked them on top and covered with soil. Not my greatest moment."
An right wing commentator boycotted a supermarket during the abortion referendum. He posted a receipt from a new supermarket to prove this. I used the receipt info to steal his club card points.
"As a junior sysadmin at an investment bank 15 years ago, I found a file called Bonus.xls in my boss's home directory, paid £25 for a utility to crack the password, and knew what mine and the whole of the IT department's upcoming bonus and pay rise was."
"I complete Wordle in a private browsing tab, then complete a slightly improved version in a normal tab. Yes, I am more than aware how sad this is."
"Raging, I returned my new £400 pram to John Lewis because it broke within a month. The staff were polite and apologetic and loaned me a replacement and said they'd fix it within 48 hrs. Husband rang and I told him what happened and he said but we got it from Mothercare..."
"Whilst working at a college, one of my colleagues started selling worn tights on a fetish website to make ends meet. Her orders got so large that half the staff in the A level department were helping her out by wearing a pair each most days. Only 2 of the 8 staff were women."
I'm a bloke and have a terrible aim when I piss. Got 2 young boys. Always blame them. No regrets.
Sometimes while in the bath I pretend my floating penis is a shark fin while doing the duh duhhh from Jaws
My kids are older now and say they no longer need the night lights on the landing. But I keep them on as secretly I'm a bit scared of the dark.
"Whenever someone says you should watch this on netflix etc and keep pestering me about it, I tend to just read a quick summary online instead. I'd rather not sit and watch TV for 20+ hours for shows I'll ultimately be indifferent too."
My wife thinks when I do all the chores after we fight it's my way of apologising. It's actually a reminder to myself that I don't need her to survive. Sounds bad but it's saved our marriage more than once.
"Tested positive for COVID and was told it was ten days isolating or I could come back to work early if tested negative on days 6 and 7. Tested negative from day 5 but sod them, using the full ten days. I owe them nothing."
"Went on a house viewing. Ridiculously overpriced & stank of wet Dogs. There was a huge, work-in-progress jigsaw puzzle covering the whole dining table - only the outline complete, with a mountain of pieces. I couldn't resist taking one of the pieces on my way out for time wasted."
"My 4 year old started entertaining me with pirate noises from her seat in the supermarket trolley. I joined her with lots of Arghs for a good old laugh. I looked around to validate my parenting and feel great, only to see an old man with a patch looking very unhappy."
Jerked off to my cousin to see how it would feel and be like. I was disgusted with myself minutes after did it again anyways the next day
Stayed on a mate's sofa after a skin full. His Missus had a hamster in a cage. Constant squeeky wheel noise led to me taking snaps of Harry Hamster hanging off my todger using my hosts disposable camera. Put the camera back and left in the morning. Didn't get invited back.

"There's one guy who lives on the top floor of our block of flats, and he never sends the lift back to the ground floor. So whenever I notice him going for a cigarette, I send the lift to the top floor. Petty, but I love it."
"I was sent a vid of my now-ex lezing up with her mate, from when we were together. I know when from which tattoos she did/didn't have. I wish she'd have told me, as the production values would have been much better if she'd used my camera."
"I just got dumped so I'm taking his cds, books and the only copy of his MA thesis to Oxfam tomorrow."

"When I worked at a call centre I used to use a silent letter form of the phonetic alphabet just to fuck with people's minds. P for pterodactyl, G for gnome etc"
"I'm a builder - 15 years ago I found £40k in a house I was renovating that belonged to the previous owner. I pocketed the lot rather than tell the new owners, who went on to tell their friends how generous I was for not charging for small odd jobs I did for them afterwards"
"I love my family so much, they will never know how much the family roast on a Sunday means to me. It is the best day of my life every week. I never speak of it in case this wholesome spell is broken, but I think they know."
"My next door neighbor is a recluse, see him once every few months. He's regular as clockwork with his bins though so I feel a sigh of relief that he's not dead in his house every Monday night when his bin is out and Tuesday afternoon when he's taken it back in."
"As a lawyer I wear the near obligatory three piece suit for work. I always take the train, and at least once a week get asked for rail information, and I always try to help. It is often the highlight of my day/week."
I can vacuum the whole of upstairs from one plug. Apart from my husbands side of the bed where I need to change plugs. It's a palava. His side of the bed currently hasn't been hoovered for over a year.
"I have 3 kids. I routinely knock their tackiest junk toys under the sofa. If they don't look for them or ask where they are, I bin 'em a week later."
"I used to buy condoms, throw them away and leave the empty wrappers in my jeans pockets to see if my girlfriend would be paranoid and controlling enough to go through them. She never did. We're married now."
Recently took my car to the garage for a service. Before getting there I changed the radio from Classic FM to a more mainstream modern station because I didn't want the mechanic thinking I'm a posh wanker.
I leave a cheap bottle of moisturiser next to our en suite toilet so my husband doesn't use my expensive stuff for his ridiculous lockdown masturbation habit. No-one needs that many 10 minute poos Allan
I'm Facebook friends with a minor celebrity I know almost nothing about. I fell asleep with my phone in my hand and accidentally added them and they accepted. I'm too embarrassed to say anything.
"Once waiting for a flight at London City Airport the couple next to me just had an order of nachos & 2 pints delivered. They both had a few mouthfuls each before racing to their flight, needless to say I ate their entire meal & beer in front of everyone In the lounge."

"I get my front door key recut once a year, because it is so much more satisfying to scratch the insides of my itchy ears with a fresh key rather than a worn one."
At school I dropped a load of microchips on the carpet and just left them. The teacher went mental and insisted someone own up otherwise it's a whole class detention. The teacher gave up after 7 days of detention for everyone in the class.
When I brush my teeth I let the toothpaste foam up and pretend I've got rabies.
A few years ago I went on a Tinder date and we ended up shagging in her work office. Apparently she had a horrible boss so when I finished I wiped my jizzy cock on the cycling top he left there. A few days later I got sent a video of her boss leaving with the top on.
My 16K ZX Spectrum stopped working & was out of guarantee. Put it in my mates 48K box and his Mum 'brought it back' to WH Smith's. They tested it & I left with a brand new 48K version.
"Back in the summer I was trimming my pubes in the bathroom and decided to throw the trimmings out of the window as the wife usually complains about the mess of hairs everywhere. Seconds later, I heard screams from the neighbors as wind blew hairs into their alfresco dining."
I have a really bad case of tennis elbow. Which comes as no surprise to anyone that knows me because I play tennis at a decent level. What they don't know is the problem is actually excessive wanking.
"I am a man who hates shaving. If I discover later in the day a rogue hair that has survived anywhere on my face, I make it my mission to get it out with my fingers. Using the razor again is cheating. I normally hold the hair up to the light and shout abuse at it too."
"To my darling Beth,We never had a pipe leak behind our bedroom wall."
"What actually happened was that I was so tired from my all night wankathon when you were away for the weekend, that I accidently hung a cup of tea on our clothes hooks and it spilt down the wall."
I once reported my wallet lost to police only to later find it under the drivers seat. I tossed it in a river to avoid the embarrassment of telling my husband this.
"I often trespass onto the estate where I grew up. Look at the house, garden, the meadow in front of the house, the railway line in the forest about 400 yards beyond the garden. It makes me sad to think my love of nostalgia and teary childhood memories means committing a crime."
I was once searched and questioned by police who mistook my Darth Maul face paint for gang tattoos.
Helped my son with his '500 words' story for a competition at primary school - he was Yr 5. Might have got a bit carried away with the sub-editing.
Invited to assembly where he won the overall school prize of a Kindle and had to read it out to the school. Cheeks burned with shame
"When I go to the supermarket, I wear a stretchy covering as a face mask. I like to pretend I'm about to go in and hold up the local Tesco at gunpoint as part of some grand heist, so much so that I'm going to be disappointed when it's no longer the norm to wear face masks."
"I'm secretly smitten with my beautiful neighbour, who is called Laura. My wife has now twigged because one day I absent-mindedly started whistling 'Tell Laura I Love Her' while cooking."
"Used to talk to a bloke in MSN chatrooms years ago because we randomly chose similar usernames. He told me about his brother taking his own life. I never knew his real name so can't track him down, but still think about him and hope he's ok."

Once went to the toilet in a pub to do a line of coke. Was racking up the line on the back of my phone when I knocked the bag and spilt it all over the floor. Not wanting to snort coke off the toilet floor I decided to shove it up my arse instead. had a great night.
My boyfriend thinks that I wax downstairs for him but really it's because fingering myself feels so much nicer when I'm hairless.
"I like to dress my cock up with googley eyes, sunglasses and bow ties, and photograph it. I have a drawer with a collection of fun penis costumes, and a large amount of photos in my phone that no one else will ever see. Sadly."
"I'm authorised to order limited free samples of prescription-only nutritionally complete drinks for patients. I found an unethical loophole with one supplier where I can order unlimited samples to myself for 'professional purposes'. To date, I've saved over £2k on food shopping."
I once reported to HR that one of my staff needed extra support due to being possibly suicidal as he had a permanent note to call Samaritans in his diary. Turns out he did house clearances on the side and had to book to drop off stuff at the charity shop.
"Whenever a deodorant runs out mid use, and I have another brand of roll-on, I never finish the application in case the untried combination of the two becomes explosive and I turn into a human bomb."
I witnessed a bad car accident & gave CPR to the driver. Brought him back to life and once the ambulance arrived they took over. I put his girlfriend in my car and put my hoody on her. She didn't return the hoodie & bled all my fucking seat. Never heard a word of thanks. Fuming.
I live next door to a unsavoury Family. Everyday for the last 10 years when I leave for work I wave goodbye to my wife in the house and shout things like don't forget to phone your mom the truth is I live alone and just don't want the neighbours to burgle my house
I use the extractor fan to evacuate my farts from the kitchen.
"My name is Danny. Whenever I hear the song Denis by Blondie, there is nothing on earth that won't convince me that Debbie Harry is singing it to me, using my name, and meaning every word that she sings."
"I am in a queer relationship with a woman. I haven't had sex with a man in years and we recently decided to have a threesome for fun, it just reminded me how much men can't please a woman in bed... I feel sorry for all the straights out there."
In private I love to sing The Beatles song When I'm Sixty-Four loudly and cheerfully as Paul McCartney did except I change the words sixty-four to soixante-quatre and sing it aggressively in a harsh French accent and imagine myself wearing a beret. Try it.
I hope this doesn't sound cold. It devastates me that my Dad chooses to travel from far to visit my deceased brother's grave rather than visit me & my grandchildren. While he mourns the loss of his son 50 years ago I mourn the loss of a father I've never had as a result.
I pick the eye bogies from my dogs eyes every day and feed them to him. He loves it.
"I work for the BBC and have a mental block with Mark Radcliffe and Marc Riley, but get away with just calling them Marc. I do however also get confused with Stuart Maconie. Sorry for calling you Mark as well."
I sat down on a bench in a public park because there was a snickers bar lying on the ground without any wrapper; it was naked. I sat next to it for a while before i picked it up and furtively ate it.

"I'm working up the courage to ask my partner to lock my dick in chastity. I think it'll be really sexy, but the main reason is it will stop me wanking all day. Maybe then I can actually get something done at work."
"I'm part of a WhatsApp group called 'the shitting forecast', it's just to share updates on that days movements. Standard practice is to share in the form of horse racing guides i.e. 'going is good, good to soft in places'. Our wives must never know."
"If I can't get the last few words of a crossword, I just make up my own words and put them in instead."
My wife has been spending a lot of time with the new guy in her team. Really done me a favour as at least I don't have to listen to her thoughts and feelings now. Gives me more time to play COD
I've always fancied my friend's husband. He recently FaceTimed me from a hotel he was staying in with work. Seeing him drunk & trying to be sexy instantly repulsed me and saved me from making a stupid mistake.I persuaded him to stop being a muppet & pay attention to his wife.
I've perfected the art of not paying for 'light' items at the self scanning area at the supermarket. The scales don't register them. I pretend to scan and if the thing beeps an alert I simply pretend I've mis-scanned. Most expensive thing I've had is coffee machine pods at £5.
"Boozy walking holiday one hot summer, I woke up naked in the tent with a mad thirst. I streaked down to the stream for a drink. The Labrador's nose in my arse alerted me to the dog walker. 'Morning' she said as I looked up from drinking the river like a recently turned werewolf"
"Years later I still miss my ex, to the point that I unblock him most mornings when I'm sure he'll still be asleep, go through his stories, and then block him again. Just so I get a glimpse of what he's up to and that he's doing ok."
At a digital agency I used to photoshop parts of Hitler into stock photos for clients I didn't like

"My husband, of 10 years, thinks lentils are disgusting. Apparently he hates the texture, the flavour and the look of them. I serve them at least twice a week and he enjoys them a lot. I call them beans"
"I'm 21 & really liked my elderly neighbour. We would chat lots and he'd invite me for battenburg and tea. We'd watch footy and such. He died recently and I'm really sad, but I can't explain to my mates as they thought it was weird to be friends with the old man next door."
"Client always pisses me off always haggling on price, even asking for discounts off agreed prices after work is complete. So, last job, I got the parts used but as-new off eBay for ⅓ the price and screwed her for full price for it. Fuck her. Don't piss off tradesmen."
My friends dad had psychological issues. We used to think it was funny to put his garden gnomes inches closer to the front door every night.
I set our WiFi password myself. It's the initials of all the people I've slept with along with the year. It gives me a secret thrill every time I share it with friends and family and everyone is always very impressed I can remember such a complex seemingly random code.
My partner loves that I always notice and say nice things when she's had hair/lashes etc done but fact is she shared her Google calendar with me ages ago and hasn't twigged that I wouldn't otherwise know most of the time
Took a girlfriend to the Pitcher and Piano in Soho to tell her I wanted to break up. They locked all the doors and some banners appeared saying 'Tenth anniversary. Anyone in the pub right now gets free drinks all night.' We stayed together for about 3 months. What a night!

"In films they show prostitutes being paid afterwards. That's not how it works. The John always pays up front. It annoys me every time, but I just can't say anything when we're watching as a family."
"In the bathroom on my first night with my wife, I found myself suppressing gas, so as not to displease my fair lady. It was uncomfortable & awkward, and I decided then that I wasn't going to live this way. She is now awoken by trumpets every morning."
Being a foreigner with a British partner I still ask about their culture in the same fascinated way Mr Weasley talked to Harry about muggles.
"I have never looked after my teeth and I am very self conscious about it to the extent I never smile , since wearing a mask I smile all the time and frankly I have never felt so happy"
"As a little girl I was obsessed by the idea of owning a penis. So much so, that I used to pilfer the used toilet roll cartons from the bathroom bin and practice taking a leak with them firmly placed against my foo in a gainly superhero stance."
I always grate extra cheese when I'm cooking so I can stand there and just eat it all.
In 1980 when I was 13 I went up to London with £10 to buy a new tennis racquet. In Selfridges sports department I swapped a £10 label onto a £50 racquet and got away with it.
I've volunteered at a foodbank for over a year. I originally went in for food but the girl working there was too good looking to admit that to so I said I'd come to help out instead.
I once didn't go home with someone after meeting on a night out because their name was Gavin.
"As a drunk student, I stumbled back to halls of residence, put food in the oven, went to my room, fell asleep. 1 hour later, fire alarm. 300 people in the halls; we all had to stand outside in the rain. My friend was more drunk than me. He got blamed for the kitchen fire. Sorry."
"The wifi in our flat doesn't quite reach my bedroom, so videos are always really laggy. Anytime I want to watch porn I wait till my flatmate is out and have a wank in his bed. Sorry mate."
"I once went on a date with a guy. I didn't really fancy him, but he told me he had a dog. I love dogs. So I went back to his house just so I could meet the dog."
For 2 years when I worked in Leeds I took immense joy at over-tightening the milk jug at Starbucks after I poured milk into my Americano. I'd quickly walk out knowing the frustration that would follow and think of it through the day with joy.
"When watching TV, I often put on the non-HD version of the TV channel just because I know it will annoy my husband."
"I flipping love Strictly Come Dancing. My wife gets so horny watching the men prance around that it's a guaranteed blowy - I get a stonk on when the trumpets start playing, long may it continue."
My wife bought me a £1000 coffee machine for Xmas. It was so generous I haven't the heart to tell her the I use machine's grinding and slurping sounds to mask the noise of the kettle being boiled for my much favored cup of instant Nescafé.

"I was a paper boy in the 70s. I used to shake the woman's magazines to get all the free samples they used to give away. We didn't buy shampoo for years. If you didn't give me an Xmas tip, then your papers always seemed to get wet as I delivered them."
When my logburner is going I like to put freshly spunked on tissues in it so that the essence of my balls ends up floating in the air round my village
My wife has bought me 0% Gin saying I need to drink less. I sereputiously pour down a bit each day down the sink whilst drinking the proper stuff. I hide the proper stuff in sexy lingerie draw as that hasn't been opened in years.
I have been using an electric toothbrush for about 5 years and almost every time I use it I dribble toothpaste down my front to the point where I will now take my t-shirt off every time I brush. I'm 35

"Been cheating daily at Wordle, keeping as a running gag to share with my Mum. Trouble is she now wants to apply for us both to go on Lingo."
"I just reached level 1000 in Candy Crush Saga, but there is no one that I can tell. I play during work hours for at least an hour a day. Given my hourly rate I reckon I have been paid well over £10k for this, which is more than £10 per level."
"When I was 16, my mum was so skint, all she could buy me for my birthday was a £2 primark t-shirt. I'm 33 now, and despite charity-shopping loads of clothes over the years, I can't get rid of it."
I've eaten mayo on toast for dinner on more than one occasion. I'm a chef in a 2 Michelin star restaurant.
I complete Wordle on my wife's iPad every morning so that I can do it on my phone later in three or four lines so that people think I'm clever. I have never managed to actually complete it in under six.
"Every year I write a Christmas card to my ex-wife telling her how much I love her and miss her. Been doing it for 5 years. Never send them, they just sit in the cupboard with our photos."
I was installing a printer for a friend. The next door neighbours early WiFi printer was unsecured. They were having and huge noisy argument. I transcribed their argument and sent it to their printer. They quickly became quiet.
"Once at a restaurant, after bringing our food, the waiter said, 'Enjoy your meal!' I replied, 'You too'."
On a Metro train once & a relatively old woman got on and I didn't know if it would be insulting to give up my seat as I really couldn't tell how old she was. I panicked and left the train 4/5 stops early. It was a Sunday so I had to wait 40 mins for the next one in the rain
When my girlfriend goes for a shower in the morning she puts the cat on the bed because she thinks it will stop me wanking if the cat's watching. It doesn't.
"Met a girl at a club, went back to hers for some action. Couldn't cum cos I was too pissed so thought I'd try doing a little wee in her instead and claim I'd finished. In trying to push a wee out I shat the bed instead. Never saw her again."

"Most nights I get home from work and get so bored I chuck the bread out of the kitchen window and tell the wife we are out of bread , then say I'll pop down the shops only to dive into the pub for a couple, in the morning I go out the back door and bin the bread."
"I used to like to take a screen grab of a colleague's desktop, put all their shortcuts in a folder, then use the screen grab pic as THEIR desktop image. Watching them click on inactive icons provided hours of mirth. No I don't have any friends."
"I'm not a forger. I just get canvases, add signatures that match the names of semi-famous artists, then sell them at an antiques market to people who think I can't use Google."
"When visiting a friend I did a huge poo but also managed to break the loo handle. Panicking, I sandwich-bagged it and put it in my handbag but didn't have chance to discreetly get rid until after my 3h train ride home which I spent in complete terror that someone would smell it"
"I was out with friends one day but started feeling ill and ended up sitting on some steps, head in hands, while my friends went into a shop. An elderly passer-by handed me £20 thinking I was homeless and I was too stunned to realise and say something until she was already away"
"Went to a fancy dress party in a nightclub in the mid 2000s as Papa Lazarou from League of Gentlemen. Got a bit warm once drunk so took off the leather jacket and wig, unwittingly spent the ret of the night dressed as a horrifically racist icon. Realised about a year later."
"I don't pay for any birthday cards, I just slip them into a weekend newspaper and run it through the self-checkout. As there is no set weight for the newspaper, it can't detect the increase. I'm not paying £2.50 for a bit of folded card."
We don't pay for gas & electric in our home. Every 6 months we simply change the name and say we have just moved in so the arrears are wiped. Never paid for any utilities in 12 years.
I once worked with a really annoying man who would sing and use phrases like 'not three bad' when you asked how he was. Sometime later I was asked to work with HR on a restructure. I changed his scores on purpose so he would get made redundant. Sorry Jason.
"I enjoy reading the more grisly news articles on the BBC news app, but always make sure I pretend to read some boring, inane ones too so the algorithm doesn't think I'm a psychopath."
"I've got a list of three minor gripes about my other half for whenever I'm in a group of lads that are moaning about their mrs. The thing is, the three things I always say I actually love about her, but it is the easiest way to build a rapport with blokes you barely know."
My old boss used to read the local newspaper and take it home for his retired wife to read. I once circled and starred the following ad 'Big brested black woman seeks older man for fun times' Still makes me laugh to picture her popping on her glasses and asking what he'd circled.
At the theatre a nice man tried to help me find milk for tea. I misheard & poured tea AND coffee in. He tried to correct me & I rudely cut him off. I walked away & drank it. HORRID. The man was Mark Gatiss & I looked up to see him looking extremely disappointed & sorry for me.
"I told my husband that the cat knocked the almost full jar of biscoff spread off the counter and it smashed. Actually, I've had it on toast every day for a month while working from home. It's the best stuff in the world."
"Back in the 80s on my paper round I left notes in the neighbours empty milk bottles asking for bacon, cheese etc. The following day I took them home. I got free food plus entertainment watching the neighbours argue with the milkman when he later knocked for payment."
"For a year I have been pranking my best mate. I got hold of about 500 key and tags I put his name and number on them all. I drop a few sets on the floor, leave them on busses, trains or into coat pockets when I'm looking through clothes at a store. He's slowly going mad."

"One of my neighbours, who lives behind my house, has a badly mounted security light which beams into our spare bedroom, I go into that bedroom several times a night just to set the blinding white off just to annoy them."
"I wear socks in bed but not because I have cold feet. If I wake up in the night and am sneezing, I just take one off and blow my nose into it. Saves on tissues. Totally recommend."
"My wife loves taking nudes, however she loves sending them to any guy who shows a hint of interest to her online. The sex we have after it all is incredible. Would recommend to everyone to try at least once."
"If I pull a solid, but slightly soggy bogey out of one nostril, I'll sometimes shove it up the other nostril and wait for it to fully dry, so I can get the joy from picking it out a second time."
Little known fact but it costs only £1.50 to get a copy of the will of anyone who's died in the last 25 years from the https://t.co/9HXf9CRlx8 website. Whenever I'm bored I search for a dead celebrity's will and have a poke around their business like a nosey bastard
"Went to a party at a friend of mine's house, really attractive girl comes up to me and says You look the type to be fun, do you want some coke?, my reply No thanks I've got a beer. I honestly thought she was offering me a carbonated beverage of the cola variety."
Client paid me £20k too much before Christmas. I dumped it in crypto with the hope that I could give it back after a month and bank the profit. I'm £5k down and sweating.
"If I come back late at night on the bus after drinking in town, I will always take a piss in a neighbours garden even though I am only a 3 minute walk from the bus stop. Apologies to that house on the corner with the big conifers."
"15 tickets left. If you've vaguely wavering on checking this out*, this is probably your last chance.Tickets --&gt; https://t.co/wVEWKwsFLF https://t.co/4oR9PqfTuZ"
Years ago when I ended a long term relationship I took a girl home and she told me she loved giving head and was very good at it.I told her it was best if I didn't check it out as I wasn't over my ex. Still keeps me awake at night in regret
As a teenager looking through my parents wardrobe I found some pornographic Polaroid photos of my parents. For about a week I used to take them to school where me and mate would wank off to them in the toilets. Sorry mum.
"Mother-in-law had become increasingly right-wing, she gets all her news from a Google news feed so I changed her settings and blocked all of the right wing newspaper websites and news about the royals. She has become much nicer to be around."
I'm 26 and can't wait to retire. I have made a countdown calendar but have over 40 years left on it. This depresses me every time I think about it.
Had some new 'noise cancelling' headphones for Christmas. Now when anyone asks me to do something I can completely ignore them and pretend it's because of the headphones and not because I can't be bothered.
I've got a dodgy looking thumb and everyone who knows me thinks I broke it doing BMX tricks as a kid. Truth is it was a weird wanking experiment that went a bit too far.
8yrs ago we had a new kitchen. My wife wanted one specific & expensive cooker hood. I hated it. We had it fitted. For the next 8yrs I bitched about it as the most expensive crap I'd ever spent money on. It was useless. Just before Xmas I found out how to use it properly.
I once filled an entire C90 cassette with recordings of my farts. I wish I still had it. I would say it's my life's greatest achievement. I'm a partner in a firm of Solicitors and I'm 63.

My partner and I had a stupid argument and I was so annoyed by her that when she she took a shower I purposely kept turning the downstairs tap on and off so the she had constant blasts of cold water.
My boyfriend and I call the random thick hairs that appear on backs Malcolm or Malcolms if there's more than one.We regularly remove each other's Malcolms.
"I'm currently rewatching Game of Thrones on DVD, but there's only 2 episodes per disk. I'm too lazy to change the disk so often - so I've set up a second DVD player to increase efficiency"
"I went to a conference where there was a little goodie bag for each delegate. Inside the bag, amongst other things, was a fizzy sherbert type sweet, which I duly attempted to eat. It was a bath bomb."
"When moving out of the way of phone zombies on a collision course, I make sure my heavier shopping bags are not quite out of the way."
Last night I had a furious wank over what I thought was the sound of my flatmate going at it with her vibrator but turned out to be one of the electric toothbrushes that had fallen into the sink
"Midway through urinating, I press the flush and have a race between the bowl filling and me finishing weeing, you can make it more challenging by flushing earlier in the cycle. If you lose you have to flush again as the bowl turns yellow. Sorry environment."
"My wife thinks I'm still working my way through my Christmas Toblerone. The thing is, I keep replacing it when I'm three quarters of the way through. I wonder how long I can keep this up."
"One night at uni myself and one of my female flat mates got really drunk and decided to have sex, just for a laugh. I struggled to get hard, but once inside her I thought I was cumming but actually it was a wee. I pissed inside her. I had to live with her for another 6 months."
"I often roll my sleeves up and play the theme from Miami Vice really loud on my drive to work, because I like to pretend I'm headed to a drug bust in a white Ferrari, instead of my crappy job in a 15 year old Subaru."
"I have a spreadsheet of how attractive I think our friends are. When I die I expect it will be found and some people will be really upset, although I hope a few are secretly pleased. My partner is the only 10."
"Whilst driving, I close my fists and curl my pointer fingers and pretend I have hooks for hands, not only does this add more humour and skill to my driving, I have actually become quite good at driving with hooks for hands."
My boyfriend thinks I am wonderful because I let him watch porn during sex. In reality we are watching porn so I can fantasise about a much bigger cock.
"I have a huge crush on Mr Potato from Peppa Pig. I don't know if it's the tash, French accent or the fact he reminds me of Tom Selleck. Either way, he makes it more bearable to watch"
"Amazing. We've sold 138 tickets, so that's 62 to go. Do come and share in our collective shame.--&gt; https://t.co/vlvRb5O8Bl https://t.co/GmPui0Vmod"
"When I am on my period, I wear the same knickers all week because the sanitary pad counts as an underwear change."
Just told my Mrs that I'd put my pyjamas on to feel comfy. Truth is I accidentally pissed all over my grey jeans when going the toilet.

"Got into a heated debate on Twitter about politics. I looked at the guys profile and noticed he was right into Wordle. I played that day's game just after midnight, then messaged him the spoiler. Hopefully made his day a bit worse."
"I've started doing my own bit for the environment by having a shit then getting straight into the shower and washing my arse, saving the planet one wipe at a time."
"My 74 year old dad is a technophobe. I set him up an email address so he could pre-order cheese from a farmers market. Without his knowledge, I changed how his name appears to email recipients to 'Lionel Penis'. After an awkward encounter, he now buys his cheese from Tesco."
"At uni I was the only one of us who bought toilet paper for the house. One time I stopped buying to see what would happen. They destroyed their arses on magazines and newspapers for days, while I pretended to do the same, but actually had a big multipack of bog roll under my bed."
"I've refused to smile, especially while showing any teeth, in any photograph taken of me in my adult life because I'm convinced, and terrified, that I have an uncanny resemblance to Fred West"
"A van cut me up so I had to slam on my brakes. Half an hour later, I saw the same van in a pub carpark so on the back panel in the dirt, I wrote I drive like a cunt. A couple of days later I followed the same van over a bridge and was glad to see they still hadn't cleaned it."
My child is obsessed with dragons and I fear this may be due to the couple of times they caught me smoking out the back door and I covered up the smoke by saying a dragon had come to ask if we needed any fires starting.
If my next door neighbours ever left washing on the line overnight I used to piss in a super soaker and squirt it over the fence at their clothes because I hated them.
"Every now and then I let a strip of hairs on my leg grow for a few months, a bit like when people have a wildlife bit in the lawns they don't mow. It is so satisfying when I finally allow myself to remove the hairs on the strip."
"Whenever my neighbours keep me awake with loud music or parties, I sign them up to as much spam mail as possible. Helps me get to sleep."
My dad hates garlic with a passion. Swears he's allergic and it makes him sick. My mum and I have been secretly adding it to pretty much everything he eats for the last decade without any ill effects and each meal ends in us smugly exchanging knowing glances.
"When we were kids, maybe 12 or 13, one of our mates parents used to store a big sack of potatoes in their garage. If we ever called for him and they were out, if the garage door was open we'd piss in the sack of potatoes. He's clueless to this day."
Over Christmas I trimmed my toenails while at the in laws and put the resulting clippings in their radiator. They constantly have the heating on high so these will be slow cooked until they inevitably crumble.
"Since being made to work from home, I find myself having a wank on my lunch break. I'm enjoying it that much, it's beginning to affect mine and my wife's sex life - I will sometimes turn down sex knowing the excitement of having a tug the following day."
Every year after Christmas I buy loads of the tubs of Twiglets once they've been reduced to a stupidly low price. They're not even one of my favourite snacks but no-one else in my house likes them so I get to eat them all myself.
As a kid I wanted to be bin man because I thought they only worked one morning a week. Little did I know the other 4 days they collected other area's bins.

"Whenever I'm in a supermarket and I spot that some bone idle slob has changed their mind mid shop and dumped their packet of beef mince in completely the wrong aisle,I always pick it up and put it back like an anonymous shelf stacking vigilante."
"The cinema foyer had been refurbished and I gazed in awe at the new open plan style. I shared my joy with the very low down man behind the pay desk. 'It's nice but you'd think they'd give you something higher up to sit on,' I said. 'That'll be the wheelchair, sir,' said he."
"When I was at Uni an envelope was posted through my door, addressed to someone I'd never heard of. It was a birthday card from their grandma and had a £20 note in it. I binned the card & headed straight for the pub with the cash. Never told a soul. Thanks grandma."
"So me and my beautiful wife moved into a bigger house last year, but it does not have a downstairs toilet. Occasionally when I go get a beer I may have a wee in a mug, rinse and then put it in the dishwasher. It's a long way upstairs."
My wife treasures and uses an old kitchen knife from her late dad. She always says how amazing it is that it keeps it's sharpness because her dad used to sharpen it on the back step of his house. She doesn't know that once a month I give it a nice edge using my Whetstone.
I made my gf a cheesecake that she loved. It wasn't til the next day I found out I'd made the base from her dog's biscuits. Didn't have the heart to tell her. She's asked me to make it for her mother coming over next week. The in-laws hate me. I'm at the pet shop now to restock.
I got very drunk at a gig and threw up into the hood of the coat of the person standing in front of me.
"If any of my neighbours leave their bins in front of my house more than two days after bin day, I start to fill them with things I've been meaning to take to the tip. Haven't had to go to the tip for two years now."
"Now that my wife has temporarily lost her sense of smell, I can lace my coffee with booze to numb the pain of dealing with the kids' bedtime routine."
"When my kids were being potty trained, I told them both that their Dad was a champion 'bum-wiperer', and that he'd won medals at big competitions. It basically meant that whenever they went for a poo, they called for him to help them."
"Working in a sandwich shop, but mind numbing at times but create my own entertainment. I love giving customers messages in their sandwiches with the sauces of their choice. CUNT for rude people and smiley faces for lovely people. It's the small things."
"Wife and I changed £400 into Euros at small rural bank in Italy. Young clerk spent 1 hour photocopying both sides of every note, then counted the photocopies and gave us £800 in Euros. We kept quiet because we couldn't bear to waste another hour of our holiday."
When I was a kid I thought a caretaker manager in football swept up and mopped the floors after he'd finished with the game.
"My neighbours are too low income to afford a wifi connection, and too proud to use mine. So I renamed mine Free Council Wifi and told them I had read about it and what the password was. My neighbour is now halfway through an online college qualification and I'm so proud of her."
Grindr is full of straight men who don't get enough action at home and are looking for a bro job. I know because I'm one of them. Half of my chats on there are about how starved of sex we are at home
"When I was 10ish I found my dads tape cassette head cleaning tape, I played it at quite high volume, got very frightened as I thought the white noise sound it made was really cleaning my head out."

"When living in a student house, I received lots of mail from a previous occupant. One day I opened it and found a bank card, separate PIN, and chequebook. I withdrew £100 from his bank account and bought a Scalextric"
My wife bought me socks with the days of the week written on them and I hate her for it. It's Saturday and I can only find one Saturday sock. Am I meant to give my other foot a second Friday? Or have one foot in Sunday already? Fuck sake.
I've got to the point that I don't know what to to masturbate about. I teach stats and my last orgasm was thinking about the probability level P&lt;0.05. You'd think it would have been over P&lt;0.01 if anything.
Soon after we got married my wife got overly frustrated with my arms flailing when asleep. She made me sleep with one of her soft toys to train my arms to hold it rather than flail. Still doing this years later. Don't need to. Just love that toy and can't be without it.
"My old neighbour and I really don't get on. One evening with 3 pissed up mates we ordered a taxi into town. It arrived and we all piled in. I got in last in the front seat and turned to see it was in fact my knobhead neighbour, not the taxi driver. We soon moved house."
Met the woman of my dreams at a party. We flirted and exchanged numbers.Before I could call her I had to go to hospital with suspected appendicitis. She was the duty surgeon and had to carry out a rectal exam while a male chaperone nurse watched.Couldn't call her after that.
There was a mug filled with spoons in a classroom at school where the teachers made tea and coffee. Me and a mate bent every single spoon during a lesson like Uri Geller on a mission. A usual suspect got the blame and I still feel a bit bad.
When I was a kid I thought shop mannequins were real humans who had at some point in their lives chosen to be turned into a mannequin. I would look at them and wonder what they were thinking. No idea when I realised this wasn't true.
When I was 16 a gay friend asked me repeatedly if we could snog. As I was straight I said no but relented when he kept asking. It was amazing and even though I am straight and married I still think about it 25 years later.
Occasionally when the incessant talking from my five year old becomes too much I cup my ear and tell him mum is calling him and then disappear upstairs. She isn't.
My neighbour leaves her kitchen light on all the time so we never need to turn on the light in the downstairs bog. Thanks Jackie I think you've saved us a couple of quid this year.
Went to find Ken Dodd's house once and left a random gift on his doorstep. Turns out it wasn't his house and we either amused or disturbed an old lady.
"After going to a rave in the 90s me and my mate got invited back to a girls house. We were on for a sure thing with her and her mate until they caught me in the dog basket licking their Dalmatian, thinking it was a giant humbug. They asked us to leave. Don't do drugs kids."
"I adore my wife, but we didn't live together before we married, and if I'd known the depressing amount of our evening time that we have together would be spent with her watching angry fictional Cockneys shout at each other on Eastenders I'd probably not have popped the question."
"When making tea, I'm too lazy to get a spoon from the drawer, so regularly scald my fingers retrieving the teabag from boiling water."
I once jumped in the garden pond in my school uniform just to get out of going to school and told my parents that I fell in.

"I've been listening to cricket in bed using AirPods but taking one out to lie on one side cuts the audio feed. As AirPods detect being in the ear I figured I could tuck the spare one between my bum cheeks. Works a treat, AirPods think they're in my ear, all happy."
I stopped a kid from drowning in the swimming pool on holiday a few years back. That evening I spotted him in the restaurant wearing a Liverpool shirt. Now I'm not saying I would have let him drown had I known but it took the shine off things.
When I brush my 4 year old's teeth I can't be arsed to do a proper job because I know they're all going to fall out and get replaced by his adult teeth in a couple of years' time
In my early 20s I basically stopped being able to write the number 8 properly. I have to draw one circle on top of another. I'm about to turn 38.
"Bumped into an old friend after not seeing him for years. Introduced his daughter as she's an Influencer on YouTube. Close, she's the star of a NSFW Onlyfans. No idea if he's aware."
I was 45 before I realised the Elgin Marbles were not... well... round.
"Me and the wife tried a swingers club not so long ago for the first time. We're late 20s and were the youngest there. Everyone was really friendly but still can't get the image of four 60 something years olds all writhing naked on a big bed together. Still, 7/10 would recommend."
Bought a lockdown puppy and to date I have amassed 1k of debt on my credit card in dog toy purchases. I have no intention of stopping.
At the age of 13 I wanked into a cup and then decided to microwave it. I guess I was thinking some sort of cool comic book thing would happen. All that happened was that it made a mess & the house smelt like jizz for ages.
Stopped using towels because I can't understand my partner's wash-or-reuse system. Rather than invite an argument I just stand there and drip. I'm a financial analyst in the City.
I worked for a mental health charity. I took advantage of everyone being out of the office for the day and called a number of sex lines in the back of the Daily Sport. I racked up hundreds of pounds on the phone bill and was subsequently fired for being an actual wanker
I told my wife about Fesshole because it was introduced to me by my mistress and I don't want to mix up what conversations I've had with each person. If I watch a film with one I have to also watch it with the other for the same reason.
"I consider myself a liberal, enlightened person. But when I did jury service, my mind was pretty much made up as soon as I saw the defendants: guilty as sin."
"When I was a child, my mum caught me drinking undiluted pop from the bottle, she then told me that drinking undiluted pop can kill you. I believed this lie into my teens, and to this day, even though i know it's a lie, the idea of drinking undiluted squash still seems suicidal."
"At age 7, I was shocked to learn that children grow up to be grown ups. I somehow assumed I would be a child forever."

"I'm really into a guy we've been hanging out for about 8 months. I cyber-investigated him thoroughly and was shocked that his previous girlfriends were all extremely ugly, obese and not on his level. This has really crushed my self esteem."
"I recently bumped into an old school friend, who I hadn't seen in years. He had a big birthday coming up, so invited me to the party. At the party he 'introduced' me to his wife, who I'd already met, several months before, on a well known hook up app. I feel awful, poor guy."

"When I'm in the steam room at the gym, I'm secretly competing with everyone in there as to who can stay in the longest. I'm currently undefeated."
My 2 year old locked themself in their bedroom. In a panic rang the first hit on Google. Who charged me £216 for using a bit of plastic to get the door open in 10 seconds. The first non-ad on Google had that solution for free.
When I was a kid and my mum took me shopping in Tesco I'd get bored so I would take one of those little keys off the corned beef tins then go around the meat aisle poking holes in the plastic covered meat. Stealth sabotage just for fun.
"I'm part of an interview panel at work who question new applicants who want to join our team - I can't answer the majority of the technical questions we ask, even though I'm the technical manager. They, the rest of the panel wouldn't hire me."
"When I turned 16 my older brother bought me an inflatable sheep as a joke present, over the next few weeks I shagged it multiple times until it sprung a leak and deflated."
I am in my thirties and still tie my shoelaces using the bunny ear method.
"I have a dog who has severe separation anxiety. I can't leave him at home ever, which is a real shame. On the positive, he's an excellent ice breaker on dates and it means I don't have to hold in my farts as I can just blame them on him."
"I teach peripatetically in numerous junior schools, seeing hundreds of children each week. If I remember your child's name it's because they're either weird-looking or a little shit."
"In-laws bought me an expensive whisky for Xmas. I smashed through it in 3 nights and, worried my partner would see just how much I drank, I re-filled the bottle with Co-op's own. Father-in-law has just sampled the 'fine whisky' & is now telling me how superior it is to others"
"I'm a senior IT engineer and I bitterly ridicule the turn if off and on again thing from the IT Crowd whenever someone trots it out. In reality though, I've made an £80k career mostly by just knowing what to turn off and on, and how to do it."
"I hate my boyfriend wearing his favourite but really worn out tatty t-shirts. He wouldn't let me bin them, so I cut them up to use as cleaning cloths. The day he decides to help with the cleaning will be the day he knows that I didn't store them away like I said."
"I really like the smell of one of my cats' breath. If he's on my lap or next to me and yawns, I get excited as I know I'll catch a whiff of it."
Since working from home in the spare bedroom I've taken to loudly playing anodyne project call recordings from Youtube so my wife doesn't interrupt me painting my Warhammer. I punctuate my silence with occasions remarks about agreeing with Derek.
Found my wife having sex on our kitchen sofa at 3am. Kids were asleep upstairs. Pretended to be outraged. Actually I was relieved as I can get divorced without guilt.

"I could never be famous. There are too many pictures and videos of me out there wanking off for lonely gay pensioners. Still, it pays for a holiday each year."
"Signed up to slimming world, on my first weigh in I placed my mums brass weights in my bra and pockets. Weighed next week, lost a stone, slimmer of the week, got a basket of free food, hailed a slimming celebrity and had to explain my diet plan, which they all followed for months"
"I sat my GCSEs mid 90s. An English teacher was sick, but left a massive pile of essays in a cupboard. I hadn't done any of the work, so nicked a pile of the essays. Now I wasn't the only one missing work and it was all the sick teacher's fault. She never came back. Sorry Miss K."
I rang my boyfriend to see where he was & his phone rang in the flat. I was so frustrated I stamped on it & broke it. When he came in steaming drunk & fell asleep I put his phone on the floor by his side of the bed. In the morning I asked if his foot was OK & claimed he did it.
"I had a summer job as a gardener. Mowing a customer's lawn, I caught a stone which shot out and cracked their kitchen window. I then remembered a dead bird I had spotted on a previous job, which I retrieved and strategically placed under the cracked window. No complaints."
There's a wifi connected printer somewhere near my shop. It's not password protected and I've been sending pictures of big penises to it for ages. Just found out it's the printer in the funeral parlour next door. Sorry.
"Back in 1978, I told my violin teacher who I hated to fuck off. He said he would phone my parents. I knew I was for the leather belt so disconnected one of wires on the phone. It took the GPO 3 weeks to fix it and I survived the crime. Still too scared to tell Dad."
I accidentally ran over the dog 6 months ago. I don't dare tell my wife. I still post lost posters around for my wife and post them to Facebook. I will take the lie to my grave.
"On holiday & in a Greek supermarket, I couldn't find where my boyfriend had got to.Tracked him down to the sex aisle where he was checking out jonnies. Was on the pill, so very confused. I shouted loudly What the hell you buying them for!? He turned round..wasn't my boyfriend"
"Everyone in my family thinks I named my son 'James' after my much loved Grandad, who also came from a long line of James's. In fact I named him after James Bond."
I used to see a married woman. One lunch time I let myself in and found she was busy with cucumber. I asked her later what she did with it. Her answer: put it in my husband's sandwiches. This is perhaps her confession.
My very attractive boss drunkenly confessed to once masturbating in her car to relieve the boredom while stuck in traffic on the M1. The merest mention of the M1 now turns me on.
My husband just came downstairs after being on the toilet and put his used toilet roll in the bin. I think our 9 year marriage is over.
I took a photo of my parked bike near Westminster in case I couldn't find it when I returned. A guy gave me a smile as he walked past which I thought was odd until I checked the photo and saw it was Nick Clegg. He must've thought I was taking it of him. Not a chance Cleggy.
"I'm a picture framer. I have a friend who's a particularly obnoxious Man U fan. When he asked me to frame several large prints of his wife and family, I hid photos of Jürgen Klopp inside the frames. It's the little victories."

I pissed on my wife during a drunken sleep walk. Our son woke to the noise & came through when she was showering. I drunkenly told him what happened while tucking him back in. He told his teacher because I'd said he could tell a teacher anything. Gave parents evening a swerve.
"Since having our first baby, my wife and I have got in the habit of sleeping in different rooms to catch up on sleep. It is glorious. I'll never share with her again."
When I was 13 I used to spend all my tuck shop money every lunchtime calling Bros' management and record company in the hope of speaking to them by pretending to be their Mum. Sorry to the reception team there that had to put up with my daily bombardment.
"I once took my wife a small bunch of flowers when I got home from work. She told everyone about this random, out of character, act of affection and how touched she was. I didn't tell her for more than 10 years that the flowers were a free gift with a full tank of fuel."
I fell asleep and shit myself on a Ryanair flight between Memmingen and Stansted on the way home from Oktoberfest. Cabin crew woke me up when the lady next to me complained about the smell.
I regularly make very small edits to Wikipedia to improve grammar and clarity. I'm more proud of it than maybe anything else I've ever done.
"I've wanted to leave my husband for years. I can only afford to do so now because both my parents have passed away. I feel deeply guilty because whilst I should be mourning, I'm secretly happy I can finally leave."
"Bought a pasta pot from Morrison's recently which had no fork. Went back in, found a packet of plastic ones and stole one, no regrets."
Supplier's office was on 3rd floor where 2nd floor was a sexline phone office. Seeing and hearing large old Mancunian women dressed in filthy tops and leggings pretending to be 18 year-old models in stocking and suspenders put me off ever ringing a sexline.
"Whilst at secondary school me & my mates decided to vandalise our maths teacher's car for a few months. No major damage, just covering it in rubbish & putting stickers on it. He ended up sitting in his car every lunch time. 23 years later I feel quite bad. It was so unnecessary."
My young step daughter stays at our house at weekends. She left her Easter chocolate in her room. I got the munchies and somehow ended up eating it all. Next time she came she asked me if I had seen her chocolates. I told her that it had all gone mouldy and had to be thrown away.
"In my constant quest for adventure, I have secretly started throwing away one item per day from the back of the kitchen cupboards. I honestly believe it's the only way to stop my wife and I eventually being crushed to death by unused packs of Colman's sauces."
"I was a married man's mistress for a time and his wife walked in on us at it. I was tied to the bed face down and completely nude. She was going mad, and I legit couldn't move. She actually managed to slap me before he pulled her out the room. Ruined their marriage."
"As a kid, my friends and I would put ketchup packets under people's tires so they'd explode when they reversed. Headmaster got wind and searched our bags. He didn't find anything but ripped my bag by mistake and had to buy me a new one. The perfect crime."
"Recently moved house earlier this year and my next door neighbours who are in their 70s are the nicest people I've ever met. We have drinks and play darts together at least 2/3 times a week and I'm starting to worry he's becoming my best mate, I'm 24"
When my little brother was 5 I forged a letter from Woolworths telling him he'd won a scooby doo video. My Mum believed it and even took him to collect it. I was shocked when they actually returned with a video. No one ever spoke to me about it. I'm so confused.

I sleep best on my side but don't like the feeling of my dick dangling down across the top of my thigh so I tuck it away and sleep every night with a mangina
"I was sacked from a major hardware store after just 16 days. Soon after, I get my first cheque and was surprised by all of the overtime I racked up from one night I forgot to clock out. Since I had already been sacked, I wasn't gonna say shit. Still laughing after two decades."
"I had cosmetic surgery on my nose 20yrs ago, but pretended I'd fallen down some stairs rather than telling anyone. I even bought some Halloween 'cut' make-up to make it look realistic for a month."
"Cooking for a girlfriend when I was younger, I found some green herbs at the back of her kitchen draw, smelt lovely. I presumed it was oregano. It wasn't. The bolognaise tasted really good, but we had to crawl to the sofa about an hour later."
Girlfriend would not give me earbuds for Xmas as said I'm clumsy - so I bought them myself. Had them two hours before the left earbud dropped out of my ear into freshly brewed tea. Scalded my hand fishing it out. Still works and I'm in incredible pain but she will never know.
"I had an exam at school and realised I couldn't answer the second paper. So I crumpled it up and put it in my pocket and when they couldn't find it when marking, I claimed they must have lost it. My parents backed me up and said it was the schools fault. I got a decent grade"
"I always go for the till with the most attractive person on it. Even though I know it makes zero difference, and often means waiting in line for so much longer, it cheers me up that there's at least one attractive person in my life that day."
"My 8 years old daughter has just commented on how her rabbit would be a certain winner if it ever participated in a 'staying still contest'. Unbeknown to her, it's actually died and we're waiting for her to go bed before disposing of the body."
"As a teen and in my 20s I thought my Dad's hobbies were lame and boring: hiking, birdwatching, gardening. He died 12 years ago. I'm 41 now. Some of my hobbies: hiking, birdwatching, gardening. Shame I can't share them with him."
I still use my fingers to count forward from 12 to figure out a 24 hr clock. I suppose I could learn an adult way but I'm committed to this method.
I phoned up the newsagent and cancelled my parents' delivery of the bloody Daily Mail because I am sick of their Brexity views which I believe are entirely due to the lies spouted by that rag of a paper. Sadly they just restarted it.
"I published my first novel last year. There's a typo on p55 which nobody else seemed to notice. I spotted it the first time I opened it, despite having read proofs about 20 times."
"There is a guy in my office so attractive and toned that I struggle to concentrate when around him. I'm a straight male, but he's literally model-standard hot and I can't look him in the eyes without feeling a bit panicky."
I guess my expenses every month.God knows why but everyone at work trusts me and my expenses continue to get paid without question.I live in constant fear that I'll be asked to produce receipts one month.
I used to work in a call centre and when the customer asked to speak to my manager I used to just put a different accent on. Worked a treat every time.
"I took my first driving test hungover and yesterday's knickers were hanging out my trouser leg. I noticed mid test and said I had to pull over, so I could stuff the knickers under his car seat, I wonder if he found them."

"I babysat for a new family, and after the parents left, the boys went into a playroom and destroyed their Lego buildings. I thought this was normal, didn't know the Lego weren't theirs. It was a whole city the dad had built over several years. 35 years ago, but I still feel bad."
I found the secret sex Twitter account of someone I know. It was definitely her even though she'd cropped her head out the nude photos as I recognised the bathroom tiles.
"I spent a fortune on smart light bulbs that don't work properly with Alexa. Now when I hear my wife talking to Alexa, I've got to manually carry out the command on the app without being spotted."
"After coming home from a run, I immediately go upstairs and have a wank. According to my FitBit this keeps me in the fat burning zone for an additional 20 minutes. Every little helps."
"I hurt my hand yesterday because I was cheating in a virtual reality game by standing on a chair, and whacked my fist into the ceiling"
I take probably 75% of my evening wees in the garden. Pissing outside is just nicer and I like to think I'm somehow saving the planet by needing no flush. My wife wouldn't agree with me so let's just keep it a secret between us shall we?
"When having a quick ham shandy in bed, I catch my gloop with the help of a used face mask. I loop the elastic under my plum sack and stretch the other elastic to its ideal position with my spare finger. If I was Elon musk I'd sell these to the world."
"Aged 15, I looked at some of my sperm, freshly ejaculated and swimming about energetically, under a toy microscope. 30 years later, as a professional biologist, it remains one of the most inspiring moments of my life."
Whenever I play ball with the dog I make sure that I wash my hands really thoroughly before I pee. That's just in case I am brutally killed and the Police forensics team discover dog saliva on my dong and wonder what the hell I've been doing.
"I skived off school & spent the morning rolling cigs in the living room & playing computer games. I popped out for 2 mins & got locked out. Concerned about the evidence inside I staged a break in, smashed the back door window with a brick & my mum called the police to report it."
Came home on a midnight train to surprise my folks at the start of Uni holidays once. Heard my dad yelling for my mum to do my arse harder to the empty house. I will never unhear anything from that night. They know I know. We've never discussed it.
Once when trying to get into a nightclub I wore my dark socks over my trainers in an attempt to convince the bouncers I was wearing shoes.
"My husband has grown a long moustache which he waxes and turns up at the ends. I cringe every time I see it, and look for any excuse to get out of sex. I don't know if I'll cope staying around long term"
I increasingly find myself rooting for Paw Patrol's dastardly Mayor Humdinger instead of well meaning Mayor Goodway. I'm terrified this is a slippery slope and I'll end up voting Tory.
"I press every road crossing button I pass even if I'm not crossing. Love it if a driver see's the press and then not the crossing, the angrier the better"
"Been with my wife for 27 yrs, she prefers a cup of tea to a bonk these days. "
Recently she's been saying that we are using a lot of the expensive extra virgin olive oil she buys. She has no idea that when she goes out I cover my member with it and fire off the custard cannon.

I took a banana from what I thought was a community bowl in the office. Later my boss came in angry that his banana was missing so I helped him search for the office for the banana and hid the peel deep in the trash.
"My husband has a moustache like Tom Selleck and I detest it. Kissing him feels like spiders crawling across my face. When an episode of Friends comes on where Monica is dating Mr Selleck, he looks at me with a stupid 'Well she likes it' facial expression. Fuck Monica!"
"Whenever I want to turn off music, I can't just say Alexa, stop!. I always have to say Alexa, stop! Collaborate and listen! to the tune of Ice, Ice, Baby."
My wife always complains that our 18 month old son doesn't look anything like her - he doesn't - so I set him up a Face ID on her phone to stop her moaning. Every time he unlocks her phone it brings her so much joy. I will never tell her.
We were so poor as kids that when I asked for a telescope my Dad made one out of an old toilet roll and some cling film. I took it outside on my birthday to use and still remember the disappointment and laughs from my friends.
Had a one night stand with a girl. We had no protection so I told her I can't have kids due to a motorcycle accident. Needless to say I have 10 year old twins and been married for 9 years
If I'm laying in the bath and need a piss I wee in a plastic jug and pour it into the toilet next to the bath. Gives me a certain satisfaction and saves me curtailing a lovely hot bath.
"When my girlfriend wants anal she asks me if I want to take the bus home, I've no idea why this phrase and have never asked"
"When playing charades with my family, even if I know the answer I make incorrect guesses so I don't have to go but appear to be participating"
"My girlfriend used to get on my tits about my weight whenever I mentioned hamburgers. So I started telling her instead that I'd had a beef salad roll for lunch. She congratulated me every time for making a healthy choice, and never did work it out. Not sorry."
"I say random shit to my husbands phone in the hope it'll make his adverts are really obscure. I got caught once, and had to explain why I was whispering cats wearing wigs to a tv remote."
"In the mid-90s a friend and I became mildly obsessed with seeing Rolf Harris live in concert and followed him all over the country for his gigs. Yes, it was with a tinge of irony, but we must've seen him live a dozen times a year. Never told anyone before."
"Unexpectedly, a Twitter user messaged me to ask why I'd replied 'spitroast' to their tweet. Then it dawned on me why my recent search on the subject didn't get any results. Naturally, I didn't reply out of sheer embarrassment"
"Back in 2003. Something odd going on in our company. As IT guy, had access to everything. Exported directors inboxes and read them at home. Found out we were all being made redundant. Too scared to tell anyone else, but selfishly made sure I had another job lined up."
I discovered that a close relative of my wife is a porn actress and sex worker. I can't tell my wife without revealing my own online habits.

When I worked in customer service for a big broadcaster I once spent a very quiet Christmas Day looking up as many celebrity accounts as I could think of to see if they booked adult movies. Data protection at its absolute finest.
"Whenever it's an office collection for a special occasion I put in £2. However, I dispise quite a few of my colleagues so I take £2 out if it's one of them."
"One of the bonuses of everyone working from home is that I regularly have to post stuff to my colleagues, meaning I can judge both the kerb appeal of their homes in street view and look at the size and state of their back garden in Google maps."
I'm 27 and still secretly buy the Beano comic for myself. The shop assistants must think I have kids. I feel embarrassed every time I buy the comic but also exciting in case someone I know sees me.
"I'd saved nearly 5k over many years in a separate bank account as a safety net for when I inevitably leave my husband - he found a paper statement I'd stupidly left out over Christmas and I panic lied and said it was for a luxury holiday. He is thrilled, I am bereft."
Every year when I ask my husband what he wants for his birthday he jokingly says a divorce. Well next birthday that's what he's getting.
"All my grandparents are dead, but I always start new jobs with all 4 alive and well. I make sure to refer to them when chatting to my colleagues. When I need a day or two off, there is a fictional fatality. Works every time. Hardest part is remembering who you've killed off."
There's a house at the bottom of my granddad's street that used to be a corner shop. Pisses me off that it isn't. I've hated the people who lived there for 16 years at this point.
When making cups of tea for my girlfriend and myself I take a swig out of the bottle of milk before adding it to the teas. I know it disgusts her so I do it covertly. The risk of being discovered is partly the reason for doing it; as well as enjoying a nice sip of cold milk
"My partner's mum died 4 days before Christmas this year. Since then, I have been pulling white feathers out of the duvet to put around the house. She told me that she was really comforted by them appearing round the house and now I cannot stop"
I'm 32 and still have to say to myself Big Elephants Aren't Ugly when I type the word Beautiful.
"I once tried my girlfriends contraceptive pill for a laugh. My nipples were quite sore for a few days afterwards but on the plus side, I didn't get pregnant."
"When I dry my dog's paws after he's been in the garden, I pretend I'm the 4th official checking a player's studs. After I'm done I give him a pat on the bum and say 'have a good game son'"
I made a rash decision and moved in with my boyfriend far too soon. I like him dearly but he just doesn't do it for me and I feel stuck. I don't have the heart to tell him he was a rebound gone wrong.
My favourite song is a demo from a Yamaha midi keyboard from circa year 2000 which I used for GCSE music. I've been humming it for over 20 years. Wish I could find it again. Was going to ask my old music teacher but he became a convicted paedophile seven years ago.
"I went away for a few nights, leaving my cat behind to be fed and watered. I was running late for my getaway and didn't clean or tidy. Upshot is…my cat seems to have drunk a bedside cup of my piss in my absence."

"To everyone at work, it's me that leaves a big shit on the close lid of the toilets. It's my visual representation of the CEO, Stuart. I only stay for the money."
I regularly go through our shared inbox at work and deliberately unmark any emails marked as 'Urgent' back to 'Normal' before the rest of my team start. I can't stand the kind of idiots that think that this will make us get to their query more quickly.
"I want to apologise to the car owners of Merchiston/Polwarth, Edinburgh, whose wing mirrors I would regularly smash on angry-drunk 3am walks home as a student in 2001. I've just hit 10 yrs sober this week, so am now much better behaved."
My wife & I started an email account for our baby so we could send updates & give him the password when 18. He was stillborn. I still send emails to him without my wife knowing because it's the only way I can cope when everyone asks if my wife is OK but they never ask me.
I double up when buying birthday cards from supermarkets. Slide another into the card you are buying and self service machine will never know. Well stocked for all occasions.
"I went away for a few days with a guy recently, I was uncomfortable & sitting awkwardly for the last 2 days of the trip.  when he questioned why, I told him it's because I'm slightly sore from our bedroom shenanigans. The actual issue was that I get poo-shy when away from home."
I once walked into a pub toilets and saw a geezer shitting in the urinal. I didn't know how to act so did the awkward British 'alright mate'
We had a 'carousel' sandwich machine at work. You put money in and slid open the door. Bloke I worked with had a really irritating ringtone and always left his phone on the desk. Kept costing him £2 to get it out of the sandwich machine.
"I run a web design company. We have a cunt tax for clients who have been rude to developers or staff, or make ridiculous demands. Sometimes this can triple their bill, just because they were an arsehole. No client has ever queried the costs."
"Had a blazing row with my wife's Gran over 10 years ago and haven't spoken to her since. Every Christmas/Birthday she still sends me a card with £20 in it. Every year I open the envelope, tip the money out, bin the card and give the money to the first homeless person I see."
"A colleague invited me to her house. Went straight to pee as I came from the pub, only to realize that I was carrying a massive dog turd in my shoe. On my way back to the living room there was a trail of shit on the white carpet. Made a pathetic excuse and left. So sorry, Cath."
When working in a supermarket as a teenager I decided to have a wank in the walk in freezer to see if is was any different in sub zero temperatures. It was broadly the same.
"Moved house in October, house was left in appalling condition, previous owners gone in to care homes. Had a corporate food hamper delivered, tried to refuse it but driver said as food would be destroyed. Spent Xmas enjoying its contents. No guilt."
Sometimes as a treat I'll go to bed with my socks on just so I can slip them off later then rub my feet on the sheets. Bliss.
"When my wife got a Peloton, I thought it was a waste of money and space. I've now realised when she's on, it's the perfect time to have a wank. Cheers."
"In 2004 I accidentally paid a student £500 instead of £50 from a university hardship fund account. I was still hammered from the night out before. I hadn't even been home. The student didn't own up and I certainly didn't, but got a new job asap."

"Found a Nokia PAYG phone in the back of a taxi in Reading. Unlocked with '1111'. Immediately obvious it was a street level dealer's burner phone, it pinged with texts wanting deals all night. I sent people to random places to not collect their drugs until it ran out of credit."
My boss was closing a deal that involved a lot of money. He asked me to send a telex - it was the 80s - confirming a call that would finalise the details. Instead of Hopefully we can talk later today I accidentally typed Hopefully we can talk later toady. Killed the deal.
I eat my toast for breakfast while using the downstairs loo for my morning poop to save time. Apparently this makes me a monster but I think it's just efficient?
"If you're the selfish bastard who keeps parking his work vans on the communal green space on our estate, I'm the reason they've all got crudely drawn cocks drawn on them in dirt every morning. You're welcome."
"I used to deliver pizza. Once I had to hit the brakes hard at a traffic light. The pizza slid off the seat but stayed in the box, the cheese was all on one side. So I just pulled it back into place with my hands and hoped no one noticed. They didn't."
I'd bloody love to have an affair. Have spent years trying to work out how to do it.
This Xmas I had covid. In the evening I took a shitload of magic mushrooms and my family had no idea. I spent the whole duration staring at the painting above the TV and no one bothered me because I was poorly.
"I was to meet my teen at the barbers to give him some cash for his hair cut. I saw the back of him, lifted up his barbers gown and thrust £20 into his hand. I then looked up and realised it wasn't my teenage son. Mine was on a different seat."
"While working in a supermarket, I spotted two teenage boys stealing soft drink by hiding it down their trousers. Their resulting stiff legged walk with extra wide legs was so hilarious I didn't stop them from leaving or let them know I'd seen."
"I started an affair with a married woman. In a drunken panic one night, when her husband came home unexpectedly, she told him I was the taxi driver who brought her home. Since then he's overpaid for taxis three times by asking if I'll drive him. He still doesn't know."
The wife was furious as the dog had started eating branches off the Christmas tree. I couldn't bring myself to tell her he's only doing it as he saw me do it drunk on Boxing Day.
When I was a kid my mum would serve up a lamb dinner to us all every week and was proud of her home made mint sauce which she made from our very own mint patch. I always declined the mint sauce because whilst playing in the garden I'd been pissing in the mint patch for years.
"My wife thought I was having an affair as a few condoms went missing from our draw, I just had a couple of wanks and couldn't be fucked to get any tissue."
"We moved house and I ordered fishcake and chips for a quick tea. The next week I went back again and was greeted with usual mate? I Englishly replied Yes, cheers. I've now been eating fish cakes for over 4 years as am to scared to ask for anything else."
"My kids are such cheapskates. Every year they buy me hampers for Christmas filled with drink and food. And every year they eat and drink everything from the hampers. So this year, I donated it all to charities. Serves them right."
"During furlough my employers generously paid 100% of my salary. But due to weird way they calculated my basic salary they used a month when I did 40 hours OT. Ended up with nearly £10,000 extra pay over 7 months."

"One youthful summer day, egged on by my mates I called 999 on the landline to say 'mummy's bleeding'. I was cock of the roost until there was a return call and blue lights at the window. Worst part was the massive bollocking from the policeman while wearing nothing but my speedos"
"A truly awful housemate went on holiday. I googled arrange callback and typed his number into countless page results. Car sales, stairlifts, pensions, magazine subscriptions, you name it. He got hundreds of calls. Ruined his holiday and he had to change his number. No regrets."
I like to imagine that future historians will find my diary & have to piece together what life was like based on what I've written about current events & my daily bowel movements.
Our builder went missing after completion and wouldn't fix some sizeable snags. Every few months I put an ad on gumtree with his number for some seriously underpriced electronic items or sold out events. Mutual friend told me he gets hundreds of calls.
I got a three month pack of contact lens fluid from Boots that was marked down from £23 to £6. Two weeks later an email told me there was a product recall on the fluid as they could not guarantee the sterility. I carefully peeled off the £6 sticker and got a £23 refund.
"A lorry driver asked me for directions in London once. I didn't want to look like I didn't have a clue where he wanted to go so I sent him right, over the bridge then left at an imaginary roundabout. All completely made up."
"When I was a younger I'd read newspaper reports about murder/robberies/violent assaults and think Awww, aren't they really nice. I'd like to do that one day too where it was mentioned that 'a man is helping police with their enquiries'."
"Struggling for masturbation material in a pre-Internet age, I once utilised a Sunday magazine advert for a semi nude porcelain ornament with prominent and momentarily enticing nipples. Upon completion I regretted my foray into ceramic titillation but the chiselled memory remains."
Whenever my in-laws come to stay I never ask them or my other half when their departure date is. That way when that beautiful day finally comes it's a wonderful surprise and cheers me right up. Today is that day.
During lockdown. I started writing my own crime novel and got really into it. Finished it last month then realised that there's a book that has almost exactly the same plot and storyline and that I wasted a year of my life.
I freelance for a company 3-4 times a year. Since covid they always send me a laptop to my house but have never asked for one back. I have 7 that I want to sell but scared they may be tracked.
"I bought a new 50 telly & didn't open it until I moved house some 6 weeks later. In moving it, I cracked the screen. Online shop wouldn't replace it & insurance didn't cover it so I bought an identical one from Sainsbury's & returned the broken one for a refund."
My dishwasher never seems to need salt but I have a big box of it so I throw a handful in as some sort of offering every time I run it. Posting this to fesshole purely to see all the people responding with detailed reasons why I shouldn't do that.
I've been single for nearly 30 years. When I need a hug I put on a heavy rucksack and carry it round for a bit.
"Many guys would be jealous of my 10 inch cock, but they never consider how fucking gross it is when I go for a shit. I'm always worried I'll catch some horrible disease from dunking in my own shitty toilet water."
Last week I caught my 5yo and 7yo putting the 'breath puffer' they'd found in my bedroom into each other's mouths and squeezing it. It was my wife's anal douche bulb for when we get frisky. Just took it off them and left.

Just found out that the fittest girl in my primary school class has now started dating the class clown. I don't know what happened in the last 20 years since we left school but I'm fuming.
I've never learnt to tie my shoelaces properly. I do a weird workaround and have to tie them in secret away from my wife and kids so they don't discover my ineptitude.
"I returned a PlayStation to the store for an exchange, citing a generic it's just not working I failed to add that it wasn't working because in a drunken haze the night before I'd mistaken my new PlayStation for a urinal - even taking care to open the CD lid, before committing."
"1970, age 12 I found draft-board records that had been stolen and dumped in the river. Notified parents and police and proudly got my name in the paper. Within a couple years I deeply regretted it -- I hope no one died in Vietnam thanks to me."
My relationship has reached a stagnation where I feel like the use-by date on a packet of condoms is mocking me.
I daydream that my band from high school carried on past our rubbish bedroom days and we got a contract. In my head one of the others drops out at the last minute and I always step up to record the other instruments a la Paul McCartney on Band on The Run. And I always smash it.
I received an Apple Watch from my wife for Xmas and the first thing I Googled was how to get porn on it
Two years ago I said Alexa Turn off and it started to explain what an orgasm was. We were having Xmas dinner. It's was mortifying.
"Out doing some Christmas shopping with the wife and inlaws when the wife's dad suggested Wetherspoon's for lunch. I remembered I had to get a key cut. Little did they know that I pissed myself while unconscious in that pub four years ago, and I don't know if I'm still barred."
"On a night out with mates in my early 20s, I necked a chunky pill which scraped down my throat and I retched it up along with a load of sick in a doorway. Picked up the pill, now well lubricated by the pile of sick, popped it down and carried on with the night."
My husband insists the dishwasher should be loaded in a certain way. I intentionally puts things in the 'wrong' spot to watch him reorganize everything before turning it on.
"Every year I buy my wife, kids, parents, siblings and in-laws scratchcards as fun gifts to play on Christmas Day. But every Christmas Eve I get home drunk and play the scratchcards myself. Cannot resist it. They've never once got a scratchcard from me. I guess they never will"
"Someone was standing way too close behind me in Greggs just now, ignoring not only social distancing but just plain old personal space. Overheard her order before she placed it so I had the last two sausage rolls she wanted."
I take a lot of pleasure when staying over at other people's houses from using their expensive face washes and other toiletries to wash my backside. I may be 40 but I must have the arsehole of a man half my age.
"My wife always remarks on what a resourceful husband I am to always have a few tissues about my person for wiping up after our messy kids. In truth, I always try and have one in case I get the chance of a crafty wank"

The main reason I'm staying in a relationship is to have someone around to call an ambulance if I have an accident or heart attack or some emergency which would otherwise leave me dying alone at home.
My young son pulled the cord for help in the train toilets. I realised the train was stopping in the middle of nowhere so we shuttled back to our seats & said nothing. The whole train was delayed 4 hours & everyone had to be sent home on coaches at the company's expense.
"For the past 10 months I've secretly been adding in famous murderers and serial killers photos into our own family photos dotted around the house, staggeringly my wife has no clue and not noticed at all, I'm determined to make it to 12 months before she notices."
I've never really been into ASMR but I find it very sexy when I get my Alexa to whisper to me.
I get free legal work done by posting questions on Quora posing at a hot young business lady and very qualified lawyers offer to do it pro bono every time. I'm a 33 year old bald man with great product margins.
"In my last call centre job I deliberately mispronounced places like Towcester, Leominster, Loughborough, Bicester, etc. just to savour the callers' passive-aggressive corrections. Bonus delight when they tersely remarked that this happens everywhere they call."
I worked in a Wetherspoons and ate a minimum 2-3 chips off someone's plate before taking the meal out to them. Everyone does it.
As a teenager I was having a wank in the kitchen when the plumber who'd been working upstairs walked in. I ran out the back door. Had to sheepishly walk back in some minutes later and have an awkward conversation with him about bath sealant.
"The wife is the member of a popular online wine club, sometimes when she fucks off to bed I'll drink a bottle, hide the evidence and then replace it with some shit from lidl with a flash label the next day. She's never noticed the difference."
Once a week I ask my husband did he see my fesshole? He spends ages guessing which one was me and eventually I let him think he worked it out. This is actually my first fesshole.
An old office had nowhere to eat except a nearby Asda. I'd go at lunch to get a sandwich and - being Asian and wearing a suit - would often get people thinking I worked there and asking which aisle stuff was in. Would play along and send them off in random directions.
I got into a lot of debt and one of the side jobs I took to pay it off was writing erotic texts for the premium rate services in the back of newspapers. I spent my evenings replying to blokes while they got their kicks. I'm a 41 year-old married Dad of 3.
"I resisted getting a dog for 17 years despite my wife being a dog person and really wanting one, because I thought it would just be a pain and they smell. Finally caved, we got a rescue dog this year and I love the furry idiot so much it hurts."
"My first words upon waking up after brain surgery were what's up you slaaaags in a shit, mumbled cockney accent. I've used the nurses explanation that it was post surgery grogginess as an excuse for years but the truth is I was pretty lucid and just thought it was funny."
My child's teacher set maths homework on school website to answer 20 easy questions. Wife had a go using the lad's login and bossed it. A month later he won an award for being in the top 10 in the world. Turns out it was an international competition.
Our neighbour took his own life a few weeks ago. We've been using his bins ever since because ours just get full so quickly

"Today I discovered that hash brownies is not just a modern, transatlantic way of saying hash browns, when I was called out for ordering a side of them with an eggs benedict."
My wife thinks she's great at reading my body language and facial expressions. Truth is I'm really good at disguising or projecting stuff non-verbally and she only ever sees the 'tells' when I perform them deliberately for a purpose. It's a little play that helps me get my way.
"I used to tell my kids I had cctv when they had been naughty, I told them that the consequences/punishment would be worse if I had to watch the footage, they always used to sing like little birds"

"I don't have many regrets in my life, but asking my then boyfriend to piss on me hours after he'd eaten asparagus is certainly up there"
"When somebody offers me a cup of tea, I ask for 2 sugars as that feels socially acceptable. When I make my own I have at least 4."
"Once, when stood on the train platform, a cargo train came flying past without warning and I fully shat myself. Had to go buy new pants and missed my train."
I once leaked shady goings on at a company I worked at in comments section of a news paper. It was talked about at work for days.I was then in a room with two people discussing making up info to weed out who the leaker was.
"I gave up smoking about ten years ago, the thing I miss most is not having the needed equipment on hand to light farts."
"Our company policy is you can get 3 meals a day when you are traveling, and 1 alcoholic drink if it's after hours. Plus you don't need a receipt for anything under $25/meal. Even when I'm not hungry I would go to a Starbucks and get a coffee with a $20 gift card."
"I saw a feral dog clamp its jaw onto a smaller dogs neck. A group of us tried to set the victim free, my contribution being to jam my finger up the offending dog's bum to make it release its grip. It didn't bat an eyelid. I was left with a stinky digit and a sense of shame."
"A few years ago, I anonymously donated my bone marrow, presumably to someone who would have died without it. Not even a card to let me know if they're alive or dead. Fucking fuming."
"I did PPE at Brasenose a few years ago. I did ok. Stepped into a city job. Everybody on the course was incredibly bright, no question. But UK politics will have some monumental arseholes in 20 or so years, I'm afraid. If you think the current crop are bad, just wait what's coming"
"I've just discovered that in the song Smooth Criminal, Michael Jackson isn't asking Eddie if he's OK."

I tried to help an elderly lady off the bus with her shopping. I managed to drop one of her shopping bags in the process. Fairly certain I heard all her eggs smashing as it landed. Sorry old lady. Shan't be helpful in future.
I have a jizz stain on the wall behind me when I'm in bed. It was at least a 4 foot shot and represents one of my greatest accomplishments this year.
I watch Top Gear / Grand Tour in secret. My partner would rather catch me watching porn than anything with Clarkson in it
"When me and the Mrs are walking our dog in nearby woodland, I like to pretend we're 2 coppers out looking for evidence of a murder crime. Twice now I've been heard by other dog walkers saying the footprints go this way ma'am"
Whenever a company pisses me off I submit loads of GDPR requests and then make them delete all my data. Most companies have no way to deal with this. It usually solves any problems I'm having with them
Someone rammed their trolley in to my ankle at Tesco and it hurt. They didn't apologise so I followed them until they walked away from their trolley and I picked up their self-scan scanner and scanned extra stuff so they would have had to pay for items they didn't pick up.
"I regularly steal pottered succulents from supermarkets by removing the stick that holds the barcode.Then going to the self service till and holding the plant as I pack , I've never been challenged and have taken 20. I earn a good salary and would never steal anything else."
My wife only ever uses the eco setting for our dishwasher. Nothing is ever cleaned properly and mugs start to get tea-stained inside. Every now and then I put it on a decent 4hr cycle when she's in bed. It's my little secret.
"When I was a teenage girl and discovered wanking I suddenly started to fancy Hyacinth Bucket's husband from Keeping Up Apperances. I imagined having afternoons of awesome sex in a Travelodge, primarily for him to relieve the tension of living with that gargoyle."
When I was 21 I slept with two sisters about 3 months apart and it caused a full on fight in their household when the older one found out. The fitter one told me their parents sat them down and said they shouldn't be fighting over a boy. Still makes me smile today.
At my last place of work one of my last tasks was to build a training process as the boss hadn't a clue. Did not bat an eye lid as MR CLINT FLICKER became the default example customer on the website and training manuals. Well made me laugh.
"I never turned up for my very first job interview. I told them it was because I missed the train. In reality I managed to split my trousers at the crotch as I was walking to the station and had to get back home like a ninja, hiding in the shadows from other people."
Is there such a thing as a chutney amnesty? I have hundreds of chutneys people lovingly make and gift to me each year. I hate chutney
"I sometimes look up famous people I fancied in the '90s to see what they look like in middle age, and reassure myself that I dodged a bullet by not shagging/marrying them back then, when I was 17 in Surrey and they were 29 in Los Angeles."
"Went for an interview in a steakhouse. It went ok until the owner, who was there during the interview, asked What do you know about me? I said Absolutely nothing. He laughed, thanked me, and I left. On the walk home I realised he'd asked What do you know about meat."
"My three foot pet snake escaped its tank and lived under the floorboards. It came out every few weeks but I could never get it back in its home. Sold the house, never mentioned it."

"Making a cheese sandwich is too much bother so I just cut a chunk of cheese and store it in my cheek like a hamster, and bite little chunks off as I eat a slice of bread straight from the bag."
"I am a 34 year old grown man, but whenever I am looking in a cupboard for a condiment or at the back of the fridge for an ingredient, I secretly pretend I'm a borg from Star Trek and that I'm using my heads up display to scan the area until I find what I'm looking for."
"Sometimes, as a treat, I pull my pants and trousers down to my ankles and wee like a little boy. No idea why, but it makes me laugh for hours."
"Back when I worked as head IT guy for medium sized company, people who I didn't like and people who were rude to me developed more than their fair share of IT issues. The worst offenders could lose full days of work."
"Tried to break up with my girlfriend in 2018, but she started crying and I bottled it. We're now 4 years into the relationship and things have never been better, but still daren't tell her how close we were to ending"
When I go to the local spa I use 3 towels. I feel bad for the environment with causing the extra laundry but I feel I have to get value for my £70 per month membership.
I spent a day making cardboard instruments for my teddy bears and made my parents sit through a concert which involved them staring at the lifeless soft toys arranged as a band on the spare bedroom floor while I sang Duran Duran songs from behind the sofa bed.
I purposefully modify my walking route so that as many car drivers as possible are inconvenienced by my superfluous use of zebra crossings
"I really hope I die before my husband does, because I can't be bothered arranging his funeral"
"You know when the clocks change, people always say You get an extra hour in bed I honestly thought it meant you got an extra hour in bed every night, until the clocks go forward again in the Spring. It wasn't until my mid 20's I worked you only got the extra hour on one night."
"I have a secret stash of washing capsules and fabric conditioner. My wife has started using one of those washing eggs, which makes my clothes smell a feel like hessian sacking. I now re-wash all my clothes and they smell and feel great."
When I was young and single I'd look enviously at friends in relationships. Now I'm middle aged and just had to look at a boil on my wife's bum to check it wasn't infected. Nobody talks about this stuff when you're 20.
Worked in telesales for a broadband provider for years. Found a code that gave a free set up but would only ever give it to anyone who sounded like a nice person on the phone. Couldn't tell them in case the call was monitored but felt like my way giving back to deserving people
This is the KO-FI which is just a fancy front end to PayPal really. THANK YOU. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I
Hello from ROB. Running @fesshole takes a fair chunk of my time - it's reading / picking all the confessions that does it. I do love doing this but also if you fancy bunging me a few quid for the effort I'd appreciate it Screengrab is a count of confessions per day for January https://t.co/KWBfskEvsV
"I used to have a Saturday job in the mid 80s on the record counter in WH Smith's. I'd spend an hour each week putting price stickers from 7 singles on the albums my mates told me they wanted to buy, then selling them for a fraction of the true price"
"I've been trying to set up two of my friends for a while, inviting them both to events so they can meet up. They have nothing in common, but her surname is Merry and his is Christmas. It's my mission to get them married and create the ultimate double-barrelled festive surname."

I'm 33 and I've only just learnt that fog is low clouds.
I once dumped someone because they didn't like Paddington 2.
I'm 44 and I've only ever had one haircut. At this point I just can't understand how it could ever be different.

Whenever I send a text in the car via the Siri CarPlay thing and I am asked if I want to send the message I always say Make it so as I am in command of my own ship just like Captain Picard.
"As a brickie apprentice, i had to go to the bookies every day and place bets for all the other workers and collect the winnings the next day."
The bookie took more money than he shelled out and so I pocketed the money and paid what was due. I made double my wages
I love having people to stay over - not because I am a nice person or particularly generous. I just find having sex with other people in the house really erotic. It reminds me of being a teenager and having to do it in stealth mode to avoid waking my parents up.
"Some neighbours in my apartment building would leave their shoes out in the corridor. It bothered me a lot, so I put an anonymous notice up in the lobby saying that I'd left my shoes out and somebody took a shit in one of them. Nobody leaves shoes out any more."
Whenever I'm out shopping I pretend that I'm waiting for my wife outside of Boots and EE by looking at my watch and tutting occasionally. Actually I'm just fat as fuck and need two sit downs between the multistory and Fenwicks.
Once every two to three months a ball of ear wax the size of a garden pea comes out of my ear. I look forward to this as it's unbelievably satisfying.
Our espresso coffee machine fills two cups at once. One side flows faster than the other. I selfishly and secretly give my partner the latte or americano or whatever with less coffee in it every time.
"My waking hours are spent clock-watching, just waiting for bedtime. Being awake is rubbish and just full of toil and stress. I don't know why anyone would bother with it."
Took daughters to see The Lion King. At the end the music Circle of Life played and I saw my daughter crying with emotion. I asked if she was ok and she said she'd bumped her leg. I played along and rubbed her shin. 20 years later she was amazed that I knew all along.
"I once worked in a big supermarket with a butchers department. We prepared a tray of pigs nipples and labelled them 'Porcine delicacy' with a price of £7.50, and took bets on how many days it would sit on the shelf. It actually sold in 15 minutes. Someone had a unusual dinner."
"I have a terrible terrible marriage, but this means that Sundays and Mondays are infinitely better than they used to be. I can't wait to go to work."
"To give the younger generations an idea of what it was like without easy access to porn, when I was a teenager I used to pause The Young Ones episode Time and have a wank looking at Jennifer Saunders' cleavage."

I didn't get a promotion but my boss retained me. He relishes at staff meetings by stating I'm being kept on 'just for now'. Got my revenge by writing his work mobile number on some sex worker cards I found in a phone box.I've kept some spare for when he changes his number.
"I went to a fancy dress party dressed as 9/11: twin towers, planes stuck to me etc. Made a girl cry because her family friend died in 9/11. I wasn't very popular that night."
I used to be with a girl who sold shoes on eBay. The amount of pervs who'd DM her for foot pics was insane. Eventually we agreed to sell pics for £30 a pop to some weirdo called sextoes99. We'd take pics of my feet and spend the money on Thursday Date Night. Sorry sextoes.
I used to sit in a office with a printer shared with other offices. Someone from down the corridor who was a massive prick would print to it. I'd take the page before he'd arrive to get it. He'd strop off and send it again & again & again. Then I'd put the whole pile back in.
I play video games on easy
"School said that because of Omicron, only one parent per child was allowed to attend their outdoor Christmas Carols that my 8 year old daughter was performing in. My wife and I went into the playground separately and stood well apart to pretend we didn't know each other."
"Used to work in Homebase, restocking shelves after closing. One day I got a roll of security tag stickers and put one under each shopping bag and shopping trolley in the store. The alarms kept going off for weeks."
"I bought a ring camera for the front of my house, it has the benefit of seeing parcels while I'm at work but it's best feature is being able to see if the neighbours are outside before I go out or get back so I don't have to engage in small talk. Amazing."
Work colleague is freaked out as I keep joining Teams calls wearing the same or similar outfit and he can't understand why. Thinks our minds are linked. His wife or another member of the team actually tells me in advance so I can change. 18 months and we're still not bored.
"I bought my first house this year and the previous owners had left a bath sheet hanging in the bathroom. The quality was better than anything I had so, to the absolute disgust of my partner, I decided to give it a hot wash and keep it. My partner still refuses to use it."
I work for a ferry company and live in NI and they give us 8 free return journeys a year. I have used every single one this year to cheat on my wife with a girl I work with that lives in Scotland
"Had a massive go at my teen daughter for loosing my usb battery pack and lying about giving it back. Turns out she did. Found it in my coat pocket on a trip to Tesco. Binned it to destroy the evidence, and now pretending I've moved on."
"When the barber uses the hairdryer and rubs my head to get rid of the recently cut hair, I pretend I am a dog and imagine he is calling me a good boy."
My wife won't let me use our en-suite. It's like you're having a shit in the corner of the bedroom. Now I wait till she's gone to work and poo in there every day. Fuck her.
I had to teach two members of my staff how to fill in a cheque and it made me feel so old.
"We had anal sex in a hotel room and there was an explosive incident in the bed. After mopping the wet pool of feces and semen, we called down to reception to tell them we found the bed in its shit-smeared state. They apologised and comped us the room."

Work in advertising. Drunk at client party I tried it on with married senior client. She fired us under a lame reason. Five of us lost our jobs. This was 15 years ago and still feel wretched. Especially as two are still friends.
"Until today, whenever I heard someone say they had a rescue dog, I assumed it looked like Schnorbitz and had retired after a life of adventure in the mountains."
Driving home from work along some back roads and could smell burning like a fire - I took a deep inhalation because it reminded me of my dad lighting the fireplace when I was younger. It was only after I inhaled I realised I was driving past a crematorium.
"I'm so British that when I was 19, a woman I had spent the entire night talking to invited me inside her flat for a cup of tea, and I genuinely thought all she wanted was tea. We drank tea until 6 in the morning, at which point I was tired and went home. Nothing else happened"
"Every Christmas I receive countless cards for the lovely old lady who I bought my house from - she is now deceased but I always display them with my own cards to make myself look more popular. Merry Christmas, Margaret."
Sometimes I sprinkle dry gravy granules on buttered bread to make a quick and easy beefy sandwich.
"My wife loves eggs, one day when she was really pissing me off I made small holes in the bottom of half a pack of them and emptied them out, that night she went make hardboiled eggs and I heard 'What the fuck?' from the kitchen, I acted just as confused as she was. I had won."
I've been ranting and raving about how energy efficient my new washing machine is for months. I've just realised I ordered the wrong one. It's efficiency is terrible. I'm a fraud.
"Whenever I log into WiFi hotspots at airports or train stations or big shopping centres etc, I give my brother's work email and click 'yes' for receiving promotional materials"
Came home drunk one night and took two paracetamol and went to bed. Woke up the next morning and realised I had actually taken two dog worming tablets.
"At least every week since the death of Terry Wogan, the theme tune from Blankety Blank has entered my head - but with the words  'aving a wank menacingly voiced by the late Mike Reid in the character of Frank Butcher from EastEnders."
"Neighbour opposite texted asking if I could check our shed for missing cat. Being lazy, I responded saying 'checked. Not there'. 2 days later opened shed door&found cat. Returned her to owner and said I found her two streets away. Got nice bottle of wine as a thanks. Sorry Bella."
"When driving along, I watch cars heading towards me on the opposite side of the road and I lift my bum muscles up pretending to jump over them. I'm 52"
My 2yr old is big into robots. I showed him the Ed 209 boardroom scene from Robocop on my phone. He's equally fascinated and terrified and won't stop talking about the 'huge ever scary robot'. My wife has no clue & will be so angry if she finds out.
I love that the BBC is showing re-runs of My Family. It allows me to say: I hate my family in front of my family. The truth will set you free.
I have a great married life. A super loyal husband who gave me beautiful children. A big house. Cars. Holidays. Money in the bank. Been together 15 years. He is quiet shy and hardworking. No1 knows we met on a panty buying site that I joined to pay for my degree & he was a virgin

"Worked at Lidl for a year, if a customer was rude and had a lot of shopping I would scan some of their items two or three times knowing they probably wouldn't check their receipt."
"When I'm out with my daughter in the pram and see a car parked on the pavement, I always have a good go at getting the pram through the gap, no matter how small it is."
"Every morning I give my boyfriend a handjob, he thinks I'm being nice… in reality I do it one handed while scrolling through twitter in bed and if I give him one it stops him begging me for awful sex so as far as I'm concerned it's a win win"
I always steal toilet paper from work. Just stick a roll straight in my backpack when supplies are running low. The shit paper stealer is my alter ego
I'm genuinely considering divorce. I'm bald and my wife asks me at least twice a day where the hairbrush is and then gets arsey when I tell her I don't know. We've been together for 8 years and I've been bald for 6 of them
"My elderly dad subscribes to a right-wing newspaper, which I manage for him. While he reads the print edition, I have fun using his online profile to troll his fellow subscribers with progressive, left-leaning statements"
"I once did half a gram of cocaine with my boss in the office toilets. He told me if I told anyone he'd kill me, but I get very wound up keeping secrets, so this is the closest I'll get to telling someone because I desperately needed to get it out somehow."
"My wife is terrified of spiders and asks me throw any from the house outside. I know they'll freeze to death outside, so I just move them around the house until she sees them again. I think I've 'thrown' the same spider outside about 4 times already this week."
I worked at Andy's Records in Cambridge in the 80's. Split with my girlfriend and slept in the store room for a year and saved a deposit for a house. It wasn't comfortable but the shop had a 24 hr security guard for free and I had the best music on tap.
Wandering round the supermarket I found an ASDA employee and asked her where the eggs were. She led me round the shop to point them out and as I turned to thank her realised I was in Lidl and she was just doing her shopping.
I once puked red wine everywhere in my boss's downstairs loo after a bbq piss up at his house. I cleaned up as best I could but the wallpaper was destroyed. A girl at the same party who was drunker than me got the blame. I said it probably was her. She was blamed for years.
"When I cut my toenails, I collect them all in a little bowl and then chew on them whilst watching tv etc. It's a bit like a bowl of peanuts in many ways. Only toenails."
As a 5 year old I encouraged my younger brother to stand on an algae covered pond at a farm. I quickly alerted my mum who fished him out. I claimed he'd jumped in for no reason and was praised for my quick thinking. My brother went home in the farmers daughters dress. Soz Dom.
Mildly inebriated at my friends wedding I cut what I thought would be a slice of cheese off the cheese board. It was their wedding cake beautifully disguised as a cheese board and everyone was onlooking in horror.
"When I was younger, I used to take dried spaghetti into the shower with me and wait for the warm water to part-cook it before eating it. I'm extremely disgusted with myself."
When I was about 7 I stole a £20 note as the church money collection bag was being handed around the pews. As we pulled up at home I discretely dropped it on the floor and said 'ooh look mum! She believed me and I spent the lot on sweets. I still can't tell her. I'm 41

Every time I peel a tangerine I make sure the skin comes off as one piece in the shape of a cock and balls. It never fails to amuse me. You should try it sometime.
When in Pret I always say I am taking away when I am actually eating in. Must of saved at least £6 this year
I am a civil servant in despair. I've changed all my work passwords to ToryWankers.
"My wife's hand job technique is awful, she approaches the task like she's sanding a bannister. Tried to guide her through it but I'm now resigned to a two day recovery period post spaff. When we said our vows, 11 years ago, I never imagined that this would be the or worse."
"Once I thought I saw a little boy get separated from his Mum at the train station, so I went up behind him and said in the least threatening voice I could, hi there, are you with anyone? A very angry 'little person' turned around. I was too mortified to even apologise."
As a child I was terrified that someone being ostracised meant they slowly turned into an ostrich.
"While cleaning up my child puke from the floor well of the car, I pretended I was John Travolta in Pulp Fiction cleaning up brains and blood as it felt less disgusting."
"Used to work in a furniture warehouse where we sprayed sofas with scotch guard etc for a fee. Apart from when we ran out, whereupon we sprayed them with water."
"I work in a blood testing lab. To amuse myself during the working day I have a game of 'blood bingo'. I have to receive blood from hepatitis, hiv and covid positive patients in one day. So far I have only managed 2 out of 3."
"I play FIFA Career so much that I write detailed match reports, keep goal/appearance tallies for the full 15 years and upload key games to a private YouTube channel to reminisce. Even bought club tracksuits. An entire universe that only I can see and it's bliss."
Live in a block of flats and neighbors are shit at collecting their post. When the piles get too much I just throw them all in the bin. Fuck em if they can't be fucked.
"When I'm doing breast stroke, I like to imagine I'm pulling my way through a giant vagina. This actually helps make my stroke stronger and faster."
I once went outside at use my house to collect from my dealer. I got into what I thought was his car. The 2 guys in the car asked me how much. I realised I had got into the wrong car & they had mistaken me for a sex worker.
I have never learned how to tie my shoelaces properly. I do bunny ears and avoid undoing the laces as much as possible. I'm 39.
During an orgy at a country house I arranged for several guys to lick my wife out one after another. I told her it was a treat for being sexy but really I did this because I wanted to watch Crawley Town in the FA cup on my phone in another room.
"Nearly died 3 years ago, I was still pissed from the night before and slipped in the shower, smashing through the glass door and slicing my leg open. Not sure how it would have gone if I didn't have my phone in the bathroom. I'm now a teetotaller and happier for it."

"My wife makes a lovely cuppa, but always insists on dipping the wet spoon into the sugar, despite many requests not to, so I always make sure the lumps of solid sugar end up in her mug when I make a brew."
"If I happen to bring up a particularly chunky piece of phlegm, I'll take it from my mouth and attach it to the hairs in my armpit. In a few hours, it dries out completely, and by rubbing it between your fingers, it dissolves like powder."
"One Xmas Eve when I was living at home, I got really drunk and threw up out of my bedroom window. The next day I surfaced to find mum AWOL, asked dad where she was? She had to take the cat to the vet as it's been really sick on the patio in the night!"
When I was 15 I went to a party and got so drunk I pissed myself. I was so drunk I decided to fling my knickers out the window and have a bath with my dress up round my tits. I left the bathroom like nothing happened. Knickers somewhere in a neighbours garden.
"I got mugged by a gang in Paris. I thought I'd get away with it by acting confused and telling them in broken French that I only speak English, but they just mugged me in English instead."
"I swallowed my tooth crown. I didn't go to the dentist, let nature take its course, recovered it from the toilet, cleaned it and glued it back onto my tooth. Saved me a fair bill just before Xmas."
"As a student, had a housemate whose GF would only give him a BJ immediately after he had a bath. It was me that used to run off all the hot water before she came around. I also used to lock the bathroom door and escape of the window too. Sorry Matt"
"My wife things I'm an arsehole when I wear my headphones in bed, as she thinks I'm trying to block out the sound of the baby. Really it's her snoring. I don't know how to tell her. The baby's fine."
My boss ended my contract early after telling me that I was going to be made permenant. He uses PayPal for taking payments so every Saturday I enter the wrong password until the account gets locked for 12 hours. Not sorry
"Since working from home I've gone bra-less. But when I need to go out,my tits get so cold I have to put my bra back on. So I just put it over my tops and when I get back in, I don't have to go through the rigmarole of removing my clothes. Wish I'd thought of this hack years ago!"
"Whenever I'm in someone's kitchen I always check if their cutlery is arranged in the order of fork, knife & spoon. For the savages that don't have it that way, I wait & offer to dry up then reorganise it correctly."
"When I was a child and saw signs for business parks, I thought they were theme parks with rollercoasters for people in business."
I sometimes switch to low fat yogurt so I can better appreciate full fat yogurt
"I had a really boring job in the 1990s that mainly involved updating a spreadsheet about river pollution. When I left I scrolled down to line 100,000 and wrote Nice one Cyril. When my successor pressed PRINT, 5000 blank pages came through before they got the message."
My 7 year old got a Nintendo Switch last year. For a year I've managed to hide the fact that he can multiplayer on the tv with his sister - meaning I've been able to preserve the tranquility of our living room while making him plug headphones into his handheld.
When working in a soap factory as a teenager. I used to take great delight in carving obscene messages into the Vanish bars of soap. It still tickles me now imagining people opening up the box and seeing you ride cocks stencilled into their favourite cleaning product.

"1st year uni freshers, girls were given rape alarms. My housemate & I realised once the pin was removed it acted as a sound grenade. We posted them through every letter box on our road and caused a mass brawl between the neighbours. A 'well that escalated quickly' moment."
My best friend died when we were fourteen. Thirty years have passed and I still miss him. No one in my life now even met him. To them he's just a name and a faded photo on our fridge door. I hate that I grew and and he didn't. I left him behind. It still makes me cry.
"As a 19yo I saw my mate walking down the road towards my flat, so decided to jump out and scare him when he arrived. What I did, in fact, is scare a workman who arrived 10 seconds before my mate. So much so, that he had to sit down and have a little cry. Soz pal."
"Knocked wife's expensive new perfume over, resulting in most of it on the floor. Tried to replace with water, resulting in the remainder going cloudy. Emptied the whole lot in the toilet and replaced the entirety with tap water. That's why the scent isn't very strong darling."
All my friends are movie buffs. They talk endlessly about movies like Scar Face and The Godfather. Now in our 40s I'm too embarrassed to tell them my favourite films are The Hangover and the 2017 version of Power Rangers. It's Morphin' Time!
You can go visit the place where Constable painted a landscape called The Hay Wain. Except I can't look at the painting without giggling because when I went with a friend we ended up fucking there next to a cottage. I go see it whenever I'm in the National Gallery.
I always line the cat litter tray with the free local paper. Before I lay it down I fold it so local MP Liam Fox is face up for the cats to do their business on him. It's the small things.
"Been a hardcore 007 fan since I was 8 or 9. When puberty hit I pretty much jerked off to dozens of Bond Girls, except Diana Rigg's Tracy DiVicenzo. Not because I didn't fancy her, who wouldn't? But because she was the wife to James Bond and I had to respect that."
"When I was about 10, I 'fessed up to my dad that whenever he was a bit sloshy - quite often - all his spare change fell into the cracks in the sofa and I would go and mine it. I have regretted it ever since. I was kid-rich for ages."
"I dumped my first boyfriend 10 years ago. We were together for nearly 10 years. I dumped him because I'd never been with anyone else and that freaked me out, I felt like I was missing out. It turns out I wasn't. He's now married with kids and I think about him often."
Had a completely crazy English teacher at school. I had to do 2 months of coursework at home after an operation but spent the entire time playing fifa. When deadline came round I convinced her I handed the paper in and she'd lost it. She gave me a B. I didn't write a single word.
I once tried to use the leafblower that my soon to be father in law stored in my garage. When I tried it the fan shattered. In a panic I glued it back together and put it back. The next time he used blew a hole in the side of it and covered his legs in plastic shrapnel.

Twelve years ago I slept with one of the bridesmaids at a friend's wedding. He's now split from his wife and is engaged to said bridesmaid. At a recent meal out he mentioned she'd slept with someone at his wedding but has no recollection who it was. It was me Phil! Me!
"I'm a jeweller and once had a locket to repair that contained a loved ones lock of hair which I carefully removed. The repair was delicate and I held my breath while doing it, as I finished I let that breath go and it blew the hair away. The locket now contains some of my hair."

"When I was 12 I went to work with my lorry driver dad. When he was out the cab I sat in his seat and pretended I was driving. I depressed the clutch a few too many times and broke it. Never admitted it was but sorry dad, I broke your lorry."
"So I started Twitter following hubby's ex because insecurities, right? Then I saw she had a superinteresting life & I became genuinely hooked on her adventures. 7 years on her life has gotten kind of ugly and dangerous and I worry about her like I would for an old friend."
"I worked in a KFC for five years and got accustomed to what mystery shoppers did when they came into the restaurant. Now whenever I visit a branch, I always ask for a receipt, eat in, check the floor for litter, see if the bins are full and then visit the toilets."
"My porn surfing and masturbation habits correlate directly with my wife's shopping trips. I get a little bit excited when she says she's popping out for an hour or so, even though I need much less time."
I sent an all staff email - 350+ employees inc CEO - appealing they look out for my lost but expensive & sentimental engagement ring. Had to follow it up two days later with another 'all staffer' as I found it in the mature cheddar cheese in the fridge at home.
"I like to search who has their AirDrop turned on in public places and send them random photos and then watch and work out who had received it. My favourites are David Seaman, Lee Carvello's Putting Challenge and The Head from Art Attack"
My printing firm did the 2019 election leaflets for a repugnant politician. And indeed 'racist cunt' is the phrase hidden in the text and photos of his evil blotchy face. Impossible to spot but I knew it was there and that's good enough for me.
"I went to a party hosted by people I didn't know. Feeling out of place, I deemed them 'too posh' and extracted my revenge by taking a bite out of every apple in a perfectly-curated fruit bowl, then turning them over so they looked intact."
I often feel that cleaning the gunk out of the screw heads on the floor of a London Underground train would be an extremely satisfying - bordering on spiritual - experience.
My other half keeps a list on her phone entitled 'things you shouldn't have to say to a man in his 40's'. It is obviously about me. My favourite entry is please don't fart in the dishwasher.
"Aged 8, I burnt my shed down when pretending to be a wizard casting fireballs with matches. Ruined my neighbor's gardens too. I'm sorry."
A report I generated was mangled by our PR team: headlines everywhere for the wrong reasons and viral outrage among parts of Twitter. Found it hilarious how quick everyone decided its part of a conspiracy from dark funds. This place rots your brain.
"As a young junior creative a found a pitch from Prince Edwards production company on someone's desk. It attempted to use nepotism to secure the work, so I photocopied it and flogged it to a tabloid. I styled out the accusations but saw several colleagues reprimanded."
"Even though I've been with my wife for 18 years, I still can't resist the urge to write 'big black dildo' on her shopping list when left unattended"
"When answering a call from work colleagues, I still say 'Good moaning' in a funny voice like that bloke off 'Allo 'Allo. They must hate me."
"When in secondary school I stole from the reception a book which had every pupils name, number, address and DOB. Hours of prank phone calls ensued. Fun times"

"On a business trip years ago when I was 23 I had sex with all the board members from the contractor, mostly on different days but a few days had three/foursomes with them. My boss still thinks he got the contract because of his negotiation skills. I haven't told anyone about this"
"All the mums in the whatsapp group had a hissy fit because one child has told all the others there's no Santa. It's 100% my son, sorry but it's much better you parents get the credit for everything on Xmas day than some mythical old white man."
"Whilst day dreaming I pissed in the bin in the gents toilet at work. The cleaner complained and I had to investigate, as the manager. The culprit was never found, but I had a stern word with male staff and told them there would be consequences if it happened again."
"I go to the gym every day. My wife thinks it's because I want to be healthy and burn belly fat, but screw those damn treadmills: I get to pet 4 different dogs on the way, and then again when I walk back home. That's all I care about in that workout."
"Once worked in an office that shared a wall and a bathroom with a well- frequented brothel. We could often hear the doings through the wall, but the topper was when I once went to the shared bathroom for a wee and found a pensioner washing his balls in the sink."
"I once passed a car in Tower Hamlets and noticed frantic knocking coming from the boot. Not wanting to become a victim myself, I kept quiet and walked on. God knows what happened."
"My wife think I enjoy when she sticks her finger up my bum when we are making love but it doesn't feel good sexually, it just felt good that she scratched an itch on the surface of my butthole one time and I have to run with it so she doesn't think I used her to scratch my arse."
I watch a couple more episodes of Hey Duggee once the kids have left for school in the mornings.
"If you want to get what you want from your insurance company, ring them 15/20 mins before they close on a Friday. We can't give a toss and just want to log off for the weekend."
"As a teenager I once found a pile of little fish in my garden. My mum was convinced they had been picked up by heavy winds from a nearby lake, even sent it in to local news and made it onto the weather forecast. It was really my mate being a dick, never told my mum."
"As a youngster I unknowingly watched an April Fools documentary that showed people cutting spaghetti off trees. Until about age 20, I seriously thought pasta grew on trees."
"When I was a teenager I stole a naturist magazine from WH Smiths to see if I was gay or straight. Definitely gay, those naked ladies playing table tennis were terrifying."
"When my wife goes out in the car with the kids, I always give her a little kiss and tell her to be careful. What I really mean is please don't damage my car."
"I always get annoyed at my wife for losing her keys. But once they were in my pocket, so I faked a call from the local police station to save face"
"Cycle commute went through a posh bit of town. One day I saw a toilet being installed through a hole in the wall of a loft extension. The next day there was a window of one-way glass obscuring it from view, but for a year after I'd look at where I knew the toilet was and wave."
Got high one night after work. Walking down the street at around 2am and seen what I thought was smoke coming from a house. I called the fire brigade and waited for them. Turns out it was steam from someone having a shower. The fire brigade and home owners were not impressed.

"My job does not exist. I spend my work day looking for things to do. I hate taking days off in case someone notices I do nothing and I live in fear of being laid off. I have just been given a 4.5% rise, everyone else got 2%. I don't understand."
"In the coat queue at 6am in a warehouse club early 00s, I rested my head on my friends shoulder. In a deep sleep I dreamt of a spring water fountain only to be rudely woken up by a group of girls laughing at me licking the sweat from his back. Stay away from molly guys."
As a kid I would hang around in Tesco's carpark and offer to pay old ladies 50p if I could take their trolley back. Most would be too confused to realise I'd then pocket their quid and make a tidy profit each time.
My lovely old neighbour recently died after a short illness. I'll really miss our chats over the fence and the sparkle in his eye but a small part of me is also quite glad there's now one less Daily Express reader.
Every day I take my lunch to work with an apple in it. Every day the same apple comes home. The apple goes back and forth each day until it becomes rotten then I replace it. I eat 2 or maybe 3 pieces of fruit a month. I'm 50.
It's been nearly 2 years and I still can't remember if the blue side should be in or out on a facemask.
"Worked at McDonalds many years ago as a 16 year old. Earned 2 stars on my badge, stole the other 3 off someone's badge when they left and convinced the manager they lost the forms. Took pence-per-hour payrise & don't feel guilty 25 years later."
"Since becoming single and living alone, I no longer wash my mugs after a cup of tea. I think of the residue left as akin to a THC build up in a grinder, each new cuppa being more powerful."
"My colleague is so attractive I wish he would move jobs. No one can keep it together around him, including me. I ignore him as much as possible to avoid embarrassing us both."
I used to think Biggie Smalls was the American version of Little and Large
"I go for a pint & rum on my Saturday dog walk. I always just sit by myself, but to justify it I tell"
"my wife i'm meeting Jim. Jim doesn't exist & never has. It's my little time to be alone & happy. Bollocks to it, all blokes should try it."
"Despite working for the Conservative party as an in-house designer, I bought multiple downloads of 'Boris Johnson is a F_ing Ct' and would happily do it again."
"Every time I get a treat out for the dog, I have one too."
"I went to a Catholic school as a kid and the whole school had assembly and prayers every morning. One day I did a massive fart at the end of the lord's prayer, the timing was absolutely impeccable and it's possibly the funniest thing I ever did."
I broke my new laptop screen after 6 days of use by closing it over some headphones. Blamed my toddler for it because I felt awful that my husband had just bought it for me.

My wife had her family round for a party. It coincided with the new Fortnite Chapter 3 event. My son was banned from watching it. I faked a tummy ache so I could sit on the shitter for an hour to watch the whole thing.
"When I'm in the bath, I like to lean against the back then lift my legs up so I slide uncontrollably in to the water. It causes a tsunami in the bathroom that I have to clean after but it's so much fun. Done it for years and just can't stop."
I have been in my new job for 12 months. HR screwed up my employment contract many times and I am being overpaid by a third. I mailed them and they confirmed my salary is correct. It isn't and I'm now keeping very quiet.
"About seven years ago I worked with a guy for a week who invited me to his WhatsApp farts anonymous group. A group chat of around 40 people who all share recordings of their farts in the chat, no text just audio clips of farts.."
"If, when driving my car into a car park I spot the same model of car as mine with a parking space next to it, I park there. I like to think the two cars would like to have a nice chat with each other."
If I see my husband look at another woman too long I'll say Oh look at her! She reminds me of your sister!
"I got totally shit ripped on a date and went to the bathroom of the pub to barf. When I flushed, the toilet water looked so clean and refreshing. I scooped some up with my hand and rinsed my mouth. Went back to my date and enjoyed the rest of the evening."
"In the early 80s I worked for Currys. When the Grand National was on, annoyingly, the shop got flooded with folk watching the race on the display TVs. About 5 seconds before the winner passed the finishing post, we would pull out the main aerial plug that fed all of the TVs."
When I was 4 I pushed my little sister into a pond. I was praised for shouting for help and trying to save her when I said she had fallen in. We still don't get on but I don't try and kill her these days.
"I always loved and owned a ZX Spectrum, but deep down I have always known that the Commodore 64 is a far superior computer."
"While I brush my teeth in the morning I have a wee in the sink so as not to wake the missus up by flushing. I consider this as a selfless act of love, but if she found out I think she'd disagree"
"A once met a girl on a night out, she stayed at mine the night, but in the morning I couldn't remember her name. So I took her to Starbucks for a coffee."
"I love my wife, but if she flicks the lights on and off to try and get me to hurry up in the toilet one more time, I'm calling a lawyer."
"I do 95% of the cooking and cleaning in our household . My wife thinks it's because I want to break down gender stereotypes for our kids but in truth, she's shit at both and I want to eat nice dinners and live in a clean house."
Tinder date 1 night stand. After we shagged a few times I offered to get food. She wanted a walk so we went to the supermarket. She went off and came back with 2x packets of Smash! I then watched in amazement as this fully grown woman ate a saucepan full of instant mashed potato
My twin brother dislocated his thumb the day before his driving test. For a laugh I took it for him after a handful of lessons. I passed his test and he proudly holds a full UK licence. Three years later I am currently waiting for my fourth test having failed the previous three.

"When I have a shower after a wank, I wash all over including my nob and my arse crack, I always wonder if I transfer a bit of spunk to my arse, and if I were to drop dead later that day, what would the coroner conclude about my spunky arse."
I get my decks out at the weekend in front of my kids and press play on old DJ mixes from the 90's while pretending to mix masterpieces from the likes of the chemical brothers and fatboy slim.  My kids think I'm a genius and should have been a contender.
"My missus has had filler put in her lips. I hate the look, have always hated it and have been vocal about how much I hate it which leads me to believe that she's having an affair or trying to drive me away. It looks awful."
"I know the lyrics to every Jam, Style Council & Paul Weller track written. Sometimes I wish I could swap my husband for someone that gets it and will sing with me."
"A girlfriend once told me I put socks on weirdly and I've spent the last 34 years wondering what the hell she meant. It'd be odd to track her down on Facebook to ask, I suppose."
"Whenever a charity knocks on my door I always engage in conversation and sign up to give donations, which makes me look like a hero. I then cancel the direct debits before the first payment."
As a teenager I used to enjoy supergluing small coins to the pavement. People get quite confused. Some people get angry. Days and days of fun.
"My organisation decided that the statement at the end of all email signatures should also be in Welsh to be inclusive. As the only Welsh speaker I translated, and added at the end the words 'here be dragons'. The whole organisation has had this on emails for four years now."
As a teenager I had a period of trying to cast 'wank spells' with the purpose of having sex with lasses I fancied. 
"Recipe - mix shite, piss, cum, tears, bogey and ear wax in the toilet bowl. Think of girl I wanted to shag and flush. My wizarding career was a short-lived failure."
I buy my wife flowers quite regularly. Nothing extravagant but she loves it. I am now finding I'm buying them more for myself. Nothing better than a fresh bunch in the house. Plus she'll arrange them better than me.
My wife takes too long to watch anything so if there's a film or TV show we both want to see I'll watch them all on my own and then watch them again when she finally gets round to it. I then have to pretend I'm reacting to everything for the first time.
"In my local greasy spoon I order a set 6 with mushrooms instead of a set 5 with chips. It's exactly the same meal, but works out 20p cheaper as chips are cheaper extras than mushrooms. I'm worth about £2m in fixed and liquid assets."
"I'm a 45 year old bloke and when I visit my parents I take a bag of washing with me. They don't know that it's not always dirty, I do it so I have something that smells like my mum and dad's house because I miss them sometimes when I'm not there."
"When I was 13, me and a pal went through a spate of setting full box of matches on fire and posting them into letter boxes till they inevitably set on fire.We did over 100 in the local area over a 12 month period. Ironically, I'm now a postman and have to empty the cunts daily."
"Following Desert Island Discs, I interviewed & recorded my parents. A few hours of the most interesting, insightful life stories - I loved hearing them. Inspired, Dad then interviewed a terminally ill mate - who treasured it and it brought them closer together. I'd recommend it."
"My mum and step dad's divorce was quite amicable until she found out he'd been having an affair. I broke into his flat to make sure he was declaring all his earnings as he said he'd had his salary halved. The liar had an overseas bank, mediator split everything 60/40 for mum."

I always struggle to remember Martin's last name. Can anyone help?
"Dial 20 on a land-line in the 80s and it would ring back. Used to pretend to the cleaner we were getting nuisance calls. She'd then grab the phone and berate the dialling tone for a few minutes while we pinched her fags. God bless you, Joan."
"I saw an ex-boyfriend at a bar and tried to win him back by telling him my mother had died. As he hugged me, I realised we might get back together and he'd learn the truth. So I panicked and said, My mistake, she's not dead, just in a coma. I can still see his look of horror."
"When defecating, I have started to continuously clenching my anus to hopefully end up with rabbit like droppings in the bowl. Prolongs my time and the throne and gives a sense of satisfaction at the end."
"I have Tinder for the sole purpose of whining to men about my shitty life and boyfriend. Won't shag 'em, but no man could be a more kind, patient, supportive listener, than a bloke who thinks he might get his knob wet."
"When switching jobs recently, I set it up so my last week of my old job and first week of my new job overlapped, which you can do if you work remote. I was paid twice for playing Call of Duty instead of only once like usual."
"The doctor put me medication for anxiety/depression and to help me sleep. I now have these wild vivid sexual dreams with women I have never met or recognise. Complete strangers, it's incredible. I can't wait to go to sleep every night."
Just ate 7 day out of date quorn mini eggs with recklessly little consideration of how my impending gastroenteritis will affect our stretched NHS
"Recently discovered if you do Meet now on Microsoft Teams, it starts a meeting with just you in it and doesn't lock your computer. Had a whole day out once, no one was any wiser"
I work in customer service and whenever someone emails I Google them to see if they're attractive. I then rewrite my reply to make it a tiny bit flirty or cool if I fancy them.
"I found messages on my gf phone, she'd cheated on me with her gay lad friend. So everytime we met up with him. I overly flirted with him. One thing led to another & I had sex with him. Thought I got my own back but found out the msgs was from her dead ex.They had the same name."
"One XMas, my dad was in ill-health. I spent over £1k on gifts for him, thinking it would be his last. Got my mum a bottle of Baileys. My mum died the following year and 12 years later my dad is still here. I feel so guilty my mums last Xmas was shit."
"In order to get a job once I lied and said I was moving to town anyway for a girlfriend I didn't have. That fact got around and suddenly everyone I worked with thought I had a girlfriend, so I had to publicly announce my break up to get everyone to stop asking."
I add the hashtag 'influencer' at the end of my most mundane social media posts so that anyone who follows this tag might end up seeing me cutting my toe nails and not some layabout in a Dubai hotel
"As I got out the shower tonight my wife asked if I'd like a you know what. Always, I replied, certain I was getting laid. I'll put the kettle on, she said."

I sometimes wonder if any of the middle-aged married men I used to catfish in chat rooms ever turned up to meet horny poor student Chloe at Leeds Station.
I absent mindedly told my landlord to look in a cupboard containing sex toys and then we both had to pretend that it didn't happen
"The wife thinks it's really sweet that I stroke her hair while she's asleep. Truth is, it seems like the least harsh way to wake her up from her relentless snoring. I haven't had a good nights sleep in 5 years."
"Whilst stacking and dressing shelves at a supermarket I work in, I make sure that the products that I really enjoy myself are the best presented as a thanks for high quality, tasty goods. The Yorkshire Tea bit is always immaculate on my watch. Immaculate. Tetley looks shit."
You often hear father's saying that being at the birth of their children was the most moving experience of their life. I was at the birth of all three of mine and always found the whole thing deeply unpleasant.
"I just submitted my PhD thesis, after 4 years of work. I didn't really work hard for it, I partied a lot, I slept with a few people at work, I called in sick when England lost and let others do my work, but I get to call myself a Dr now. Work smart, not hard."
"I told my husband that I enjoyed watching him wank off, to avoid having sex, now I regularly watch him, repulsed, with his stupid cum look and his unused left hand doing some twitchy thing like it doesn't want to be left out. Shoulda just had sex"
I've got some big shoes which I throw on when I can't be arsed cutting my toenails.
"My job frequently sees me attending events all over the country, often at weekends.It happens so often people don't question it. As a result I invent events I have to go to in order to avoid spending weekends visiting my girlfriend's revolting, abusive, neofascist father."
It's taken me to my 40's to realise how much better toilet duck is for getting skid marks off the bowl than pissing them off.
"Met a girl on Tinder who promised me blowjobs so good I would shit myself. Due to a series of unfortunate circumstances, I did shit myself in her company and I never got the blowjob."
"Planning on leaving my partner of 25 years because kids are grown and he is selfish, tight fisted, unsupportive, has poor personal hygiene and is dismal in bed. But his mum just died and left him close to £1m. Fucking going to milk that cash cow."
"My girlfriend will go out on the piss maybe twice a week when I'm at work, when she gets home she always rolls a joint and then falls asleep. She never remembers. I've been coming home and smoking the pre-rolled joints for months and she's totally oblivious."
I spend my evenings reporting my friends tweets and then act all sympathetic if any are upheld.
"With extremely stubborrn 'floaters', I flush manically while shouting Get Down, Shep! in a John Noakes Blue Peter voice."
I have convinced my wife that I like jazz. I only listen to it because she can't stand it. Those few hours of peace I get whilst I listen to some pretentious bollocks does wonders for my mental health as it means I don't have to answer or listen to her inane stories.

"Dated an Oxbridge graduate. Afraid of my inferior intellect, I Sky +'d University Challenge & learnt by heart the answers to all the questions of 1 episode. 3rd date was at my place & I put it on. Took the gamble she hadn't seen it. She hadn't, so I became a certified genius."
"Throughout the day I make a mental note of all the things in our house that are going straight in the fucking skip I am going to hire hire as soon as I get home from my partner's funeral, assuming they go first of course."
"I call Baileys Christmas Milk', as I make all my work coffees from it whilst WFH"
If someone ever sends me an email that requests a read receipt I make sure I refuse to send them a read receipt
We have our central heating on but my girlfriend insists on also using one of those electric fan heaters all day because she refuses to put on a jumper and walks around barefoot. I pay the bills and the rent and I'm one argument away from smashing that heater into tiny pieces.
Amazon don't pay their taxes. So I order stuff and say I haven't received it. Fuck you Amazon.
When I worked as an HCA in a hospital I was asked to remove a dressing from a diabetic gentlemen's foot. The bandage was a bit sticky so I gave it a small tug and his little toe came off with the dressing. He didn't notice so I put it in the bin.
"This cold weather I try to use the toilet after my wife, that way I get a pre warmed seat."
"I've been selling stuff on eBay for 4 years, and never paid a £ for P&P. Nick all the envelopes from the work stationary cupboard, put the address on and as long as Marketing Director is on there the post room just send it out for free no questions asked. Just hit 1000 sales."
My favourite part of the day is driving to and from work because its the only part of the day that I'm not at home or work.
"I made it to my early 30s before someone - my own daughter - corrected me on the pronunciation of sesame. The amount of times she just let me put 'See-same Street' on for her and said nothing, waiting until the opportune moment to shame me in public. She's gonna go far in life."
I always press the 'extra shot 45p' button on the coffee machines at Wild Bean Cafe. Haven't paid the 45p even once.
"Years ago we borrowed a thermos from family I don't much like. They're gammony and materialistic, but too polite to mention we didn't return it. I make sure it appears in a few FB pics each year on outings, because I know it will irritate the hell out of them if they see it."
"A stranger got the wrong number and sent me a filthy text. Of course I replied. For two years I'd get random filthy phone calls in the middle of the night, and they eventually stopped. I miss that."
"NYE 1999 party at our local pub. My then girlfriend, now wife, suggested having a quick shag in the toilets, so we snuck away close to midnight and did the dirty deed. Inadvertently walked in as the clock struck midnight, thought everyone in the whole pub knew what we were at."
"Every week at work we have a 50min team Zoom meeting. 50 mins = 1 episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I keep my camera on but mute the call. My manager just praised me for how engaged I always look, but I'm just gazing adoringly at James Marsters."

Back soon after I got married in 2001 I hid a CD-R with some very awful Japanese porn on it behind the DVD on some WW2 documentary DVD that I knew my wife would never watch. Completely forgot about this until about 2 weeks after we'd donated all our DVDs to a charity shop.
"I once dated a man who was actively dating several other women, as I discovered when he logged into his email on my laptop and forgot to log out. I also then discovered he liked to be pegged, so that pic went out to all his business contacts."
"Terry the consultant once called me 'just an administrator'. For the next 12 months his internet connection kept failing, just his, no one else in the company. He'd have to call me, but neither him or this administrator could figure how it kept randomly happening. Sorry Terry"
"I set up a fake account on a Spare Room website to wind my mate up. He was very excited, posting in our group chat about a very attractive polyamorous pole-dancer that wanted to move in with him. Of course it was me all along, and I'm none of those things."
"Work in recruitment. A fairly known paedophile ex teacher in the news resurfaced online looking for work in schools, his career gap said explain at interview which in reality was his time in prison. Sold this to the papers, got paid £750 for the pleasure. Still dont feel bad."
I'm a paramedic and one time I was driving and hit a speed bump at 40 mph. The patient in the back had been vomiting blood en route after a tonsillectomy. The bump catapulted the bowl into the air and showered her in her own blood and vomit. Looked like a scene from a horror film
"Circa 2002, I worked in a central London office. Microwaved popcorn for too long, forgot about it, and it caught fire. The entire 12-storey central London office block was evacuated. There was an investigation, the lost business cost hundreds of thousands. I never admitted it."
My husband died suddenly earlier this year. When England reached the final of the Euros this summer I really happy they lost because I didn't think it was fair that he would miss out on something that would have made him so happy if they had won.
I like to use the left of two urinals at work because it is slightly blocked. If I time my piss right and deliver maximum piss thrust whilst coordinating with the auto flush I can get it to overflow onto the floor.
Walked up to my wife and started holding her hand in Sainsbury's I looked at her to find a woman I'd never seen before looking amazed/horrified and then saw my wife pissing herself laughing at me. I'm still mortified 5 years later and my wife still takes the piss for it.
"I open Spotify and click on an obscure electronic track, then I switch to private session and listen to Adele."
Every morning I wake up to Chris Evans. Not because I like the little tossbag- far from it. The only thing that gets me out of bed is to turn him off.
"When we get chip shop chips, I squirt tomato sauce over mine to stop my wife pinching them."
"One of my friends attends the same gym as me. I saw him stood in the changing room naked, I walked towards him pointing at his genitals and said 'most have them in adult size'. It was at this moment I realised it wasn't him."
I now need a new gym.
"I was admin for a very large BitTorrent tracker/site back in the 00s, and the user donations helped me buy a house and ensured there was a constant supply of skunk and beer in the house. Oh, and it payed the hosting fees etc."
I worked at a large arts venue. They had touch screens for visitor feedback and postcodes! I used to enter outlandish postcodes every day on break. I did this for years until a marketing colleague proudly showed me the visitor stats from the Scillies and Orkney.

"I'm a dad of 2 young kids. When I'm tired of being bugged, I remind myself in about 10yrs, they will feel totally indifferent towards me at best.. no different to how I was. The thought almost brings me to tears. Now I never turn down a game of hide & seek and hug them too often"
"Despite having three kids, which is plenty enough, I don't want to get the snip just in case things go pear shaped with my wife and I meet someone who wants kids."
"I cut my lip licking a knife exactly as my mum said I would. I couldn't admit it so said I'd been beaten up at school which started a whole process of visiting the school, police and assembly warnings about violence. I'm 50 and never told anyone that I wasted all their time"
"In the 90s I was as mad fer it and stereotypical northern as they come. Full on Oasis type clothes & hair; the swagger, the patter, the banter. I secretly much preferred Blur to Oasis and still listen to them now."
3 years ago my colleagues threw me a little surprise party and I didn't have the heart to tell them my birthday was actually 2 months ago. Long story short I now have a real birthday and a 'work' birthday.
"I hate Apple and relish any opportunity to slag off their over-priced, over-styled, over-hyped buggy products. My new employer gave me a MacBook Air and I can never go back to a Windows machine. It's bloody glorious and I treat it better than my cats. I can never tell anyone."
I spend a long time choosing thoughtful vinyl for my dad for birthdays and Christmas because I know one day I'll be inheriting the collection
"I work in genetics, and still remember that XX is female and XY is male because XX looks like a pair of tits and the Y in XY looks like a hanging penis."
"I'm an aide to a government minister, and I can tell you that it's far, far worse than reported. He doesn't even have the most basic grasp of details, everything has to be spoon fed, and it's not some clever front. I should really resign, but I have no skills and huge debts."
"At 37, one of the small pleasures I take out of life is that I can buy overpriced babybel cheese and my mum can't do fuck all about it."
I've been sucking my stomach in all my waking hours for all my adult life. Unconsciously at this stage. There's no way I can stop now.
"I live near a school, when parents inevitably park in front of my drive or hang over it, I put their licence plate into the government's MOT checker to see if it's valid, I then create a reminder in my phone to report them on the day it expires."
I lied when filling in my rajar diary because I detest one of the presenters on the only radio station I actually listen to. Hopefully he'll lose his job.
"So I ordered a laptop for my sons birthday, got it delivered to my old address, went online and cancelled it and reordered it for my current address, they ended up delivering both, 1 to old address and 1 new address but only charged for 1, so I returned 1 and got a free laptop."
"I'm married, but started flirting with a woman at work, after a few weeks we met up at a hotel, got to the room, got naked, but then I couldn't go through with it, turns out I actually love my wife and only want her, not sure whether to be happy or sad about it"
Still not been back to the hairdressers since lockdown ended and can't imagine ever going back unless the mrs loses use of her hands

"Once got an 'after-pub' tube to Heathrow and in a carriage was just me and a drunk, sleeping business man with a really thick novel between his legs. Just before my stop I picked up his book, tore out the last page and carefully put it back. Still feel bad abut it 27yrs later."
"When at work, I often set up Google meetings just for me so I can use the webcam to check out how my hair is looking from multiple angles"
"If my football team loses, I don't use my football mug for at least three days. That shows them."
"I have a mental list of people who've fucked me off in the group chat. I bide my time - often years - until they mention a Netflix series they've started watching, then I google spoilers and bombard them with them."
"My cat had fleas so I bought her some kitty shampoo. It smells of peaches and tea tree. I tried some on myself, and my hair has never been so soft and beautiful. I plan on buying more."
We have courtesy umbrellas at work and I emptied a vast load of paper hole punches into one as a prank. Forgot about it and this week a VIP used one with the CEO when going for lunch. Big investigation ongoing. I'm keeping very quiet.
Opened all the Christmas presents one year to see what I was getting then blamed the dog. He spent Christmas Eve in the garden as punishment - sorry Henry.
"I am advertising a job at the moment. I've stipulated must be vaccinated. This isn't coming from a health perspective, it just feels like an effective way of deterring nutters and weirdos."
Made an embarrassing typo when sending a message on Grindr. Apparently I like my sick like I like my coffee. In someone else's mouth.
When driving home I leave my GPS on until the end even when I remember the way. After living alone for so long I know it's the only time anyone will ever say Welcome home to me.
"On the tube I pretend to play the piano in the air. I like passengers thinking I'm musically accomplished. I can't play the piano, can't even read music and live in fear an actual pianist will one day all me out"
"I fix iPhones for a living, at least 10 people a week come to me because their phone isn't charging properly, 99.9% of the time it's because there's fluff in the charging port."
I charge them £35 to scoop it out and have a sit down for 20mins to make it look like good value.
"I had a Blue Peter badge when I was younger, that I'm still convinced got stolen by someone at school. A year or so ago, I wrote to Blue Peter pretending to be 8 y/o, wrote a shitty poem that took 10 minutes to write and got a replacement badge. I'm 26."
If I'm making both tea and toast I like to remove the tea bag from mug with a knife to ease the butter spreading and accelerate the melty goodness.
I once did too much poppers at a rave and ended up with a horrible Hitler style scabby moustache.
My mom was an X-Ray technician. I remember her telling me about a drunk guy who fell out a second floor window and me wondering how did that happen. Now I know exactly how it happened since I don't have a bathroom on the second floor of my house.

I sit at my office desk wearing wired 'in the ear' headphones so the chap that sits opposite doesn't engage me in conversation.Sometimes I even plug them into my phone and listen to something.He is without exception the most dull and monotonous human I have ever encountered.
I often jet my wife's skidmarks off the toilet pan when I piss and NEVER ask for thanks. That's what you call unconditional love.
Saw a Black Friday deal on a big pack of condoms. It was about £8 for 30. Didn't bother as I'm not sure I'd use them all before I die. I'm 44 and married.
"Aged 14 I blew a fiver down the arcades. Rather than fess up to my mum, I beat myself up, quite severely, and said I'd been mugged. Spent a night in hospital, got interviewed by the police and even had a story published in the local paper."
Girl upstairs has a new bloke. They were noisily shagging constantly. Now whenever the start I play Marvin Gayes 'let's get it on'. They are at it a lot less now.
"Each time I'm pregnant I develop long, thick dark hair behind my knees. Like armpit hair, but on my kneepits. "
It's disgusting and it can get up to 5cm in length but I'm so proud of it. My normal leg hair is blonde. 
No other pregnant woman I know gets this.
"An eBay selller put an item for Buy it now at £1 by mistake, he asked if he could cancel, I said it was for my sons birthday, as I'd lost my job, I have no kids, still worked and re-sold it for £50"
In a music shop as a teenager I noticed a large bin of TDK D90s with a sign that said 'Free Tape.' I took one and walked out. At home I realised you were meant to send away for it.
Now that I'm working from home I can check the laundry basket for items that look clean and still smell of detergent from the last wash. My wife still has no idea the boy's been wearing the same school clothes several days in a row.
Been seeing a new guy and last time I saw him I noticed he had a huge spot on his back. I did everything in my power not to pop it while he was asleep. Desperate to see him again just to see THE ZIT.
My partner turns on the shower in the morning and pretends he's having a dump while playing on his phone. He thinks the noise of the shower drowns out his activities. It doesn't. I can hear him cracking one out. Just wish he had this much sexdrive for me.
"When I was 7, I spilled a cola drink on the remote for our brand new TV. In my panic, I figured the microwave might save me. I buried the molten goo in the garden and thereafter refused anything cooked in that microwave without explanation."
"When I first discovered wanking I was worried my room would smell of it if I did it there, so I would sneak out of the house with a copy of zoo in my trouser leg and do it behind the shed."
I've given up drinking as part of a diet that I'm on. I'm looking/feeling better and I know my mental health is improving but I'm fucking bored and that's getting me down.
"My first romantic + sexual relationship was aged 23 with a woman from Brazil. I still get a furious hard-on every time I hear Portuguese being spoken, 20 years on."
I am an academic at a prestigious university and I cannot spell the name of my field of research without looking it up.

Once had a walk to a puberty leaflet. Kids don't know how good they have it with easy access online porn.
"Chose to have a danger wank in the sitting room while staying at my great aunts house as a teenager. She walked in on me, said a brief embarrassed 'oh' and made a swift exit. She died a couple of months later, and I've always worried that it was the wanky shock that did it"
"When I worked in an old peoples home at Uni, I once did a shit so big I had to lift it out of the bowl with several paper towels and throw it of the bathroom window onto a flat roof outside. The seaguls feasted on it for a good week."
"My boyfriend is awful at sex but I'm trying to improve his confidence. The other day, he was in the mood and pinned me to the fridge to kiss me, holding both of my ears. I honestly had to pinch my thigh not to burst out laughing as I felt like a football trophy."
"On a school trip to Rome as a Catholic teenager, I was an enthusiastic shoplifter who stole loads of stuff. Then, in a ceremony at the Vatican, the Pope blessed all the gifts I subsequently gave to pious grandparents, so that's all right, isn't it?"
"My neighbour and I aren't really into each other, but we're fucking, basically only because my wife and her husband like to get together and bitch about about how we fold towels and such trivial shit."
I watched the news in amazement when people were emptying the shelves of loo rolls in the supermarkets at the beginning of lockdown in 2020 I said people doing it were nutters. Today I have purchased my first packet of loo roll since March 2020. I had it stashed everywhere.
"The other day, I had to pretend to my Manager that I'd twisted my ankle at home, as he asked why I was limping."
Truth was I'd just emerged from spending too long hiding on the toilet at work and my leg had gone numb
I just put a log on my fire. As I put it in I realized to my horror that it had a beautiful red admiral butterfly clinging to it. It was instantly incinerated. I feel so guilty.
I've tried to quit porn a few times unsuccessfully in last two years in the hope that I would gain some extra confidence/motivation in the dating world. I've just relapsed again and I'm now starting to think I might just be destined to be a single wanker all my life.
Wife and I broke the bed with sex. After repairing it we broke it again following week. I feel incredibly smug about it. At least I did until I looked up the price of a new bed frame.

My wife tolerates me keeping chickens as long as they are regularly laying eggs. Three of the elder girls stopped about 9 months ago but I couldn't even think about getting rid of them. Instead they have been 'laying' Lidl free range eggs every day and she doesn't have a clue.
Whenever I crouch down to bang a load of clothes in the washing machine I pretend I'm in a heist moving cracking a safe when I'm slowly clicking the dial to cotton wash.
I used to change all the ones to fours on my colleague's Suduko when his back was turned at work. The way he used to scratch his head with his pen in confusion still makes me titter in bed at night. He's a rather nice chap and still my Facebook friend. Sorry Pete.
"I am 48, well educated, cultured with an appreciation for the arts. But I still don't believe a conductor - the orchestra type, not bus - actually does anything."

I won't spend money at a Wetherspoons but I will always find one if I'm out in town and need a shite. That's my silent protest
I needed a shit when I was out with my six month old. Popped into the nearest baby changing loo only to discover too late there was no toilet paper and I was all out of baby wipes. I'll never forget my kid looking me in the eye as I wiped my arse with a spare nappy.
"I go through the racists who react with laughing emojis on migrant news stories on Facebook, find the ones with employers on their profiles and report them. No regrets."
"I am a 50 year old male who works in IT. I regularly post questions to tech forums using a 20 something female persona, as I get better quality responses. It's amazing how many older male forum users Inbox me with indecent proposals. Stop it chaps, Kitty is not that kinda girl."
"I'm a manager in a bar that does lots of coffees I have never been shown how to properly make different coffees so I don't know how to make a cappuccino I always just make a latte, it's been 5 years and no one has ever complained"

"Currently in the depths of a crippling manflu. Every time I blow my nose, I open the tissue to examine the patterns like a snotty Rorschach test. It's always a roadkill flying squirrel."
"My garden backs onto a primary school playground. Every time a ball gets kicked over my dog goes mental, plays with it for a bit, then bursts it. In the past year he must have burst about 30 footballs. I love throwing the burst balls back over the fence."
"I have a partner but I am seeing someone on the side, the best thing about this situation is occasionally I get to have two dinners in the evening."
"Late one eve I was found unconscious & bleeding from the head by a nice couple. Upon waking, I told them I had been assaulted, because I was too embarrassed to admit I was drunk, had been walking with my eyes closed & into a lamp post. Smashed my phone in my pocket too"
I'm 6'3 but when people ask me how tall I am I say 6'. It causes a lot of funny arguments with tall and short people alike
"Walking home late one night I dropped a full glass bottle of beer in a street and it shattered. Drunk, I panicked and ran off, then circled back on myself pretending I was someone else and tried to clean it up with a show of mock outrage. I doubt anyone had even seen me do it."
"When I was a kid, I used to ask for a Steve Bull haircut at the barbers. Went in yesterday and had to ask for a Conor Coady. Appreciate this won't resonate with the majority who aren't Wolves fans."
I can tell how hard I have worked each week by doing the BBC news quiz. If I score under 4 I've been working hard. 4 or more usually means I've been a lazy cunt.
"I bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend six months into our relationship.Then I met her batshit crazy family and I don't know if I want them in my life forever. The ring lives in my top drawer at the office, my girlfriend and I have been together for four years now."

I have to cut the picture of the duracell bunny from the packet because if I see him looking at me when I'm changing batteries in my vibrator it totally puts me off.
My girlfriend calls beans on toast with a bit of cheese through it cheesy beanos. Each and every time she says it aloud I love her a little less. Cheesy beanos? Fucking hell.
"Five years ago I saved a boy's life in a Norwich park when he wandered off & fell in a pond. I jumped in, saved him & magnanimously left once he was safe. There was no news article, no Who was the mysterious hero? FB appeal nothing.I've been fucking furious about it ever since."
My son saw me walking into the bathroom naked for a shower and told me I had a six pack on my back. 
Wish it was and not just back fat.
"As a recording studio engineer, I've lost count how many times bands/producers have asked for more of whatever on their track. I just turn a knob that does absolutely nothing until they say that sounds perfect. Twats."
From an early age my kids were trained to alternate their routes walking up and down the stairs to preserve the life of the carpet pile. 7 years on and it's in immaculate condition! I worry I've damaged them forever.
Many years ago when watching Oldboy for the first time I didn't know the ending and I was hungover and incredibly horny. Knocked one out to the sex scene. Now every time I even think about that film I remember I wanked to a father and daughter shagging. Bleak.
"Circa 2000 I joined a group cracking satellite TV codes, a bit like Bitcoin mining. They were finding about 4 per year. I ran a big office network so was able to use 1000 PCs all night to find 6 codes a week. I could have folded proteins for medical science but I wanted free TV."
Sometimes I tell my husband we have mice so he'll clean up more. I've even made fake mouse poo with chocolate to make him more concerned. He has put poison down and wonders why it's not working. Only when he diligently cleans more is our mouse problem is 'resolved'.
I realised my kids were watching too much tv when I was wanking and found myself humming the theme song from Postman Pat.
I have a senior job in a leading Shakespearean theatre company but find all Shakespeare plays boring as fuck and actively avoid going to watch them.
"On holiday visited a monastery with an icon of Virgin Mary. Legend says anyone who looks into her eyes goes blind so her face is covered. Definitely had a look, didn't go blind."
While working from home I have blocked out a two-hour slot every day with fake meetings so I can just watch a movie or some TV. I will name the meeting something related to what I intend to watch and have the other meeting participants named after the characters in it.
On a bus once a lady pressed the bell but it didn't ring. So I pressed the one near me for her. She then realised it wasn't her stop so stayed on. But I'd rung the bell and everyone saw me do it. So I had to get off rather than be embarrassed at having wasted everyone's time.

"I have Long Covid and every time I have a wank it sends me into a crash that completely destroys me for 3-4 days with fatigue, muscle pain and appalling headaches. Wear a mask and get jabbed or risk missing out on your daily dose of plonk-pulling you cunts."
"Over 25 years ago, aged 16 I had a Saturday job at Tesco and worked the frozen food section. My friend and I thought we were criminal masterminds sneaking in to the walk-in freezer out the back and standing in there, - 20°c, eating 'free' ice creams, shivering our balls off."
"I'm so lazy that, if I go to the dishwasher and find that it needs emptying, I just add my dirty plate and start the wash again so that someone else will have to empty it later."

Mrs asked if I wanted her mother staying with us over Xmas. Of course I don't. Will be desperately trying to catch Covid to keep her away.
I've recently landed a role with a faith-based organisation. I was asked about my faith / beliefs at interview and bull-shitted due to being a massive atheist but also wanting the massive pay rise. I've now keep being asked to lead daily prayers. Fuck.
Many years ago I left a job where I put prawns behind the radiator. They did not discover the prawns for three weeks and when they did blamed someone who went on sick leave after a row with the manager.

When the hairdressers ask if I'd like a head massage during the shampooing I've always said no because I don't know how to react. Should I smile and sigh slightly or blankly stare straight ahead? It's a social etiquette nightmare. Most of the time I'd actually quite like one.

When I was 13 I had two gerbil's. One of them killed and ate the face of the other one. Horrified I threw the cannibal gerbil over the back garden wall and told my mum that I took it to the vets to be put down. I still wonder if it survived.
We are happy to be in your lives making you vomit https://t.co/vDu3kaCApd
I spend all day at work silently judging people by how dated their email address domains are.

I always use the childrens urinal if there is one. I pretend I'm a giant with a massive willy.
"I am a teacher, and almost all major batches of marking are powered by me promising myself i can go and have a wank when I've finished. This is also how I used to get myself to complete my homework as a teenager. It's a wank circle of life."
"When I use the walk up atm at the bank, people always leave their bank receipts on the floor. I occasionally pick one up to make sure I have more money in my account than the fellow person"
I watch the full adverts for a few selected YouTubers I like as a way of saying thank you.
"I've been an accountant for 15 years + handling accounts for multimillion pound companies, I still have to google the difference between net and gross amounts just to check I've got it right"
Our cat really obviously prefers me to my wife. She pretends not to mind but I wish he'd be a bit more subtle about it.
Whenever I rent a van I go through all the shitty preset commercial radio stations and change every single one to Radio 4.
"My bf said he wanted to eat various foods off my body and from inside me. It was hot and the sex was great. He's keen to do it again, but the sheets were a state and I'm still finding jam up my arsehole a week later, so I'm not sure it will be worth the effort."
"I used to think the phrase horses for courses referred to someone eating horse for starter, main and dessert."
I was shagging a married man who gave me an STI. I told him he had to tell his wife and he refused. So I sent a glitter birthday card to their house telling her to get checked for chlamydia.
"I live in a semi0detached new build, my neighbour has the exact same layout of their house but mirrored, and we both have a home office in which is on the other side of the wall from each other. Every day without fail, I hear him watching porn through the wall, and I'm not sur..."
"Before I got married I didn't consider myself attractive and lacked confidence with women. Since my divorce, I just can't fail. Must have slept with upwards of 40 women in four years. Randoms, old friends, married, the lot. I don't get it. I'm not even trying. And I'm exhausted."
My husband thinks we have Amazon Prime because of the speedy delivery times. 
"I'm actually obsessed by the cheesy romance films, especially the saccharine sweet Christmas ones. I sometimes watch two in a day."
One of the best things about having sons is that when you pee on the toilet seat and just can't be arsed to clean it up you've got more likely culprits in your household to blame it on.
Guy at work found out I invest in crypto and kept asking me tips on coins to buy. I said I couldn't help him. He kept doing my tits in asking so jokingly suggested he buy some POOCOIN taking the piss. He actually did it. Fucking dickheads made better returns than me this month
I have a strict six-wipe rule after using the toilet. If the paper still isn't clean I'm calling it quits anyway. Literally don't have time for this shit.

"I love my husband very much, but once a month I would love to have an entire week without him being at home. It's exhausting living/working so close with someone all the time."
I split my with my wife after ten years and the main difference I notice between dating pre- and post-marriage is the almost-complete disappearance of the full bush
"Once worked as a tiler in a swimming baths, the tile design was blue and yellow, and in a weird staggered Z pattern, however the design didn't account for existing wall beams meaning it looked like Nazi symbols when we had finished no one said anything however"
"Worked for social housing years ago- went to a house which had seen someone murdered, to cut corners we replaced the blood stained bits of the floor - however the new colours didn't align exactly meaning the outline of the body was visible once we relaid the floor"
Being a lonely only child I always knew I wanted more than one myself. What I wasn't prepared for was 2 children that can't stand each other. They have nothing in common and barely say a word to each other. Now think my parents were actually on to something.
"If someone leaves the room while on work video call I shout out Alexa, set an alarm for 3am. Hasn't worked yet, but one day."
"I am a journalist of many years' experience, but have only just realised it is fiery and not firey. I would like to apologise to the subs desk for the minor inconvenience."
Fooled around with a well known Irish comedian in our early teens. Keep waiting for her to use the anecdote somehow to confirm it to my partner. I'd even take a derogatory mention at this point.
"During a secret affair with a housemate, me and my mate stayed at her folks house. When everyone has gone to bed I went to get some action, not realising she had swapped rooms with her dad. I got to millimetres of kissing her dad who stirred but didn't wake. Almost very tricky."
"At a uni halls party we went out to get some nitrous oxide only to come back and find ourselves locked out of the kitchen where we left the balloons. Rather than buy some more, in our nitty desperation we preceded to use condoms. Very slimy. Wouldn't recommend."
I've just moved in with my girlfriend and all was going well until we ordered a chinese takeaway and she put the rice and curry on slices of bread .. it's the most disgusting thing I've ever witnessed and I'm afraid of the next secret I find out about her
"Sometimes when I'm shopping with my mask on I pop a custard cream in there and pretend I'm a horse in a slow western, ambling around while nibbling from my nosebag."
"As a prematurely balding man, I wish I hadn't wasted my youth on awful and bland haircuts. If you are considering something outlandish, do it now. Before it's too late."
When trimming my nails I always leave an index finger nail untouched so it can be used as a dedicated nose picker. I alternate between left and right index fingers at each trim.
"Years ago I taught English as a foreign language in Russia. My class of teenagers pestered me all year to teach them the most obscene swear words. As a result, there are likely businessmen walking round Moscow today who think they're really racy for saying zooterkins."
"Parents of newborns: if you think having a new baby is bad for your sex life, wait until you've got teens roaming the hallway at all hours. You're currently still in your honeymoon period, and it's very much downhill from here…"

"When I got married in 2007, Harry Potter: The Deathly Hallows had just been released. On my wedding day morning I was reading it so much, my prospective - and amazingly still - Father-in-Law took it away and put it on a high shelf."
"I bought a house in Spain at a ridiculous price, but I never told my wife it was so cheap because the last owner murdered his wife and children and hung himself in it, and none of the locals would touch it with a ten foot pole. We're moving there in a month."
"My wife has a strict no number twos in the downstairs loo policy. She's away this weekend and last night I had to go urgently and delivered one of the foulest, most rancid, messiest shits of my life into the downstairs loo. She'll never know."
There is a smell coming from the cupboard we keep our potatoes in that in too scared to investigate.
"As a boy I was so embarrassed by my slightly pixie, feminine nose that I tried sleeping with elastic bands wrapped around my head and over my nose to make it flatter and more masculine. But the bands just pinged off in the night and woke me up. And I still have a girl's nose."
"I finally shagged a girl I really fancied from college at a music festival. I regretted it because the smell of her turned my stomach after 2 hot, sweaty, alcohol filled days without showering. Still did her like a trooper, but never again."
"I'm currently out on a 50 mile cycle. But I'm not, I'm currently 15 miles away enjoying a fry up in a cafe, then I'll cycle back."
When supermarket shopping I like to get freezer stuff in the trolley early doors do so can tell my wife we're 'On the clock' and avoid the expensive toiletries aisle.
Today I was driving out of a busy car park. As I had 40 minutes left on my ticket I gave it to the nice lady taking my space. The only problem was that the ticket I gave her was from last week. Today's was still on the dashboard. I'll never recover from the guilt.
"My 10 year old son asked me what's the best thing about being a grown up, as a 41 year old man I could honestly say it's being able to buy a console game whenever I want."
"We have cups with animals on at home. When my girlfriend has been nice I'll make her tea in the deer cup, because she's been a dear. When she's been a cow I give her the cow cup. She doesn't know I do this."
"Changed number of local Indian Restaurant in mates phone to my work mobile, he only orders when drunk and never recognises my dodgy voice and continues to complain how they never deliver."
My husband is beginning to look more and more like his mother. I am not OK with this.
"I went away for the weekend and lost my keys. My partner has made me suffer for weeks about this, talking to me like I'm a fucking child. So I cancelled his expensive birthday present and he can just make do with the shitty home-made gifts from the kids"
I secretly log into my partners account and unfollow women I know he has a crush on.
I put my soft cock in the hole of my wife's Dyson hair dryer. Then watched porn to make my cock hard so I could shag it. It was rubbish. 
I have done this so you don't have to.

"When I was 18 I worked in a carpet shop, the owner would bark at me every 20 minutes to make his coffee. I had a cold saw at the time , I picked the scab and rubbed the moist underside of it around the rim of his mug."
My son keeps telling people in school we are rich- we certainly aren't me and my wife's salary is 48k combined pre tax- but then his friend came for tea and was shocked we weren't wearing coats at the table as his parents can't afford to heat the house and it made me realise
"I've been with my wife for 15 years and still have no idea what her phone number is. If I lost my phone and had an emergency, I'd have to borrow a phone and call my parents - or TalkSport"
Woke up with a love bite after a night out and had a right go at my boyfriend for leaving such a hideous thing. Turned out to be dried on ketchup. Sorry mate
"My friend keeps sending me pics of his ugly baby. He knows it annoys me. I've changed the settings it my messaging app so pictures don't auto download. Take that, you prick."
I download films to my hard drive instead of watching them on Amazon or Netflix. That way my wife doesn't know how little work I do each day. I often watch 10 films per week

"Many years ago, I phoned a charity telethon which had just interviewed Frank Bruno and said I'd donate £50 if they could ask Frank to spell 'chrysanthemum' on air. Understandably they declined, but the shame lives with me still."
"I spent so much time at work posting on a football forum that I worked out in one year I got paid about £18,000 before tax for doing so."
"When there's news about some ordinary person who died tragically, I find them om facebook and read their wall of grieving friends as some kind of real-life horror entertainment."
I often eat chocolate and biscuits etc and put the wrappers in the kids bedrooms so I'm not blamed. Never been caught and Mrs regularly bollocks them. Sorry kids but your Dad is a greedy guilty fat bastard.
"I'm 47. Was telling a young colleague about Brass Eye and The Day Today, and said I can lend you the DVDs if you like. His derisory snort made me realise what a dreadfully sad old donkey I have become. Never felt so old."
"I found a little ziplock bag of what I assumed was coke, left accidentally in the toilet of a restaurant in Edinburgh. It turns out that it was, the best I've ever had, disappointed I won't be able to get more."
"I've been wearing the same blue fabric facemask since March 2020. It's disgusting, but I'm attached to it."
"When listening to a guitar riff I picture myself on stage at our works Xmas do smashing a solo with Jenny from sales looking on in awe and blowing me afterwards. Then I take out my headphones, look at the unused guitar I can't play in the corner of my room and have a sad wank."
"A company promised to sponsor a charity event early in Covid times, but despite me putting their logo on everything they ghosted us. So: I embarked on an 18-month word-of-mouth campaign against them, several of their biggest clients cut ties, and today they've gone under. Ta ra"
Since having kids I don't think about how old I'll be when I die but how old they'll be when I die and it makes me so sad to think that when they're my age now I'll almost certainly be dead.

"Whilst wanking using my phone, whatsapp popped up from a family chat announcing my aunt's cancer had spread and she had weeks to live. Pings followed from grief-stricken family members. Past the point of no return, it was difficult but I achieved to most sombrest of ejaculations"
Had a vasectomy before I met my wife. Didn't tell her. We've been married four years and she's now seven months pregnant. Sneaky tests confirm I am still shooting blanks. Karma.
"I've been home working alone since the start of the pandemic. Two months ago I started skiving off Friday afternoons to watch a DVD instead. My wife and child have no idea I do this, and I look forward to Movie Club all week. I've got movies planned right up to Christmas."
I can't listen to Tears For Fears' Everybody Wants To Rule The World without singing the Fireman Sam theme tune to myself.
I once stole a whole box of pens from work. Jokes on me though because during lockdown I've used them all for work purposes.
Years ago I was a waiter at a wedding venue and quite often they would serve molten hot soup as a starter. Some days I'd be hungover and have to dodge guests' baby carriers on the floor while serving it. The anxiety of spilling it on to a baby still makes me shudder to this day.
"My wife, her mum & the rest of her family cut their entire meal into bite sized pieces before they start eating, like you would do for toddlers, & just shovel it down using just the fork. It takes me all my strength not to shout eat like human beings you animals at every meal."
We paid a princely sum for our washing machine and dishwasher because of all their fancy features and programmesYet we only ever use the same programme on each and have little idea what the others do
"When I'm flying I switch on my phone's hotspot and set the hotspot name to Free  WiFi it's fun watching the other passengers calling the flight attendants, looking for the password."
Didn't like a kid in year 1. We were told we had to make him birthday cards. Didn't say what kind. I drew a sad birthday card with him in a coffin and his family crying around him.
I spent most of the summer crying over a guy who has five sweeteners in his tea
When I worked in town I used to deliberately photobomb tourists during my lunchtime runs on the South Bank. I like the idea of my sweaty stupid face ruining their holiday snaps.
Found a massage shop next to my therapist's office that gives happy endings and have stopped seeing my therapist. Doing better than ever.
I have had the same network user name for 17 years. I have to press 9 separate keys to enter it. I do it to the tune and rhythm of the Countdown clock running out. Every time.
A teacher said I shouldn't go to Oxbridge because I was too lazy. I was angry and determined to prove him wrong. Turns out he was absolutely right and I'm still paying for it 15 years later.
"Whenever we change the bed, I always put the duvet cover over my head and pretend to be a really gropey ghost, grabbing my wife's boobs instead of the corners of the duvet and going whooooooooo. I will never grow up, you can't make me"

My wife asked me the other day if I had any regrets. I said i wished I'd said a better goodbye to my mum when she was dying from cancer. Actually my biggest regret is missing the huge explosion of pus from a spot on my cock I squeezed under the covers one night.
I remember excitedly spotting that Maureen Lipman's 'Beattie' character in the British Telecom adverts sounded like BT when spoken. I rushed to point this out to my family and still wince at the memory of their pitiful expressions.
My wife eats burgers upside down. It infuriates me. She doesn't see the problem
My piece of shit ex who I have a restraining order against dodges child maintenance like it is the plague by lying through his teeth and avoiding paying tax. He is also the single biggest buyer of my soiled underwear from my anonymous social media accounts.
15 years ago I emigrated to Australia from the UK. Before I left I maxed out all my credit cards and took out a personal loan to start my new life down under. Knowing full well I wouldn't pay any of it back. Probably bankrupt in the UK but have perfect credit here.
"I live with my partner, their lazy grown up son and their dog. I love my partner dearly but detest the son and the dog. It's getting harder and harder to hide this and I'm genuinely concerned that I'm going to lose the best thing that's ever happened to me when they realise."
My elderly father in law thinks that when he rings the local Chinese takeaway they know who it is because he has a lot of takeaways and is very proud of it. Don't have the heart to tell him they have a database system where his name comes up when he calls.
I check an ancient yahoo account daily just in case this bloke who ghosted me 13 years ago wants to get back in touch. Inbox and spam.
"Despite being straight I've started to notice I have a type of male porn star, no beards, decent physique, not overly tattooed, hate the noisy grunters."
In encouraging her to embrace her passions I've just accidentally convinced the woman I have a crush on to take up escorting. I feel like that stupid coyote holding a broken cliff edge.
I once secretly served my husband a pie made from dog food because he refused to believe that dog food was tested on humans. He never suspected and complimented me on the pie. We are divorced now by the way.
"In my teens and 20s I could suck my own dick, I'm getting myself back in shape so I can hopefully do it again 20 years later."
"I've slept with 30+ men and the only one who has made me orgasm during sex is my current & probably forever partner. Before it was only vibrators. I can't tell him why I know this means he's the one, cos it only happened after a year together, he will know I was faking until then"
"FROM @robmanuel: Fesshole takes a stupid amount of my time, reading and picking your confessions. If you fancy bunging me some pennies for my efforts it would be greatly appreciated. If you don't that's fine too - I'm not stopping you reading it. Thanks https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
My dog used to go to doggy daycare. The place always had a faint smell of dog shit but the girl who ran it was really hot. Now when I smell dog shit I sometimes get a semi.
"Desperately in love with a school friend, and unable to actually talk to her about that, I faked an accident for her to witness. At 11, I bizarrely thought this might make her see me as a love interest, not just a weird fat kid who very unconvincingly 'fell' out of a tree."
These are the best public confessions for November. A bumper crop - do follow and share @fesshole as it helps keep the great confessions coming in. Thank you. https://t.co/gRz7Ev8Ed3
As the office manager of an advertising agency full of absolute knobs I secretly switched the coffee supply to decaf for over a year. The snugness of knowing how much shit they used to spout about the power of an espresso was the only thing that got me through the day. Wankers.
"I drive a hybrid car. When driving through areas I dislike or past houses of exes, I use the petrol engine to add extra pollution. Then I switch over to electric mode going through nice towns or places I'd like to live."
"Every morning since 1st January this year, I have been throwing a teabag into my cup from a distance of about 2 metres. It's not that far, but I haven't missed yet. Every morning the pressure builds as I try to make it a calendar year without missing. It's getting very tense."
"As a yoof working in a supermarket, I got a small box put 2 wires out the top, wrote bomb on it and put it in an aisle. The shop was evacuated by police whilst the Bomb Squad made the device safe and I spent 15 mins trying to erase my fingerprints by rubbing them on a wall."
Every Tuesday night I tell my family I'm going to AA meetings. Instead I just go to my local bar and have a few drinks. It's really nice that I don't have to invent a reason to leave the house to drink like other nights. They even encourage it.
Dorset Wildlife Trust's live stream of their owl nesting box really gets me through tough days at work. If I feel stressed out I watch an owl sleeping in real time. Sometimes it preens itself.
Went on a trip to Scotland with my ex and his single friend. We drank on the first night and my ex initiated a threesome but quickly fell asleep. We were still screwing when he woke hours later. I couldn't walk the next day or the day after. It was supposed to be walking holiday.
"My workplace has quite a relaxed approach to listening to music while working. I tend not to bother unless one particular colleague is in the office, I put my earphones in without music playing just so I don't have to engage with them."
Whenever I get a parking ticket I formally appeal with the most elaborate petty reasons I can think of fully in the knowledge that the appeal won't be successful. I get massive satisfaction from the thought that the appeals department waste hours reading and responding
"On the way home from a half day at work, I just bought a giant box of Malteser Teasers which I fully intend to devour alone for lunch. I also bought a redundant birthday card to indicate to the assistant that I am definitely not a greedy gutbucket."
Our work used to get free tea and coffee. When working late one evening I took one of the bags of PG Tips home. 1100 tea bags. Didn't have to buy tea for about 18 months
"If I see someone driving too fast the other way, I give a quick flash of the headlights to warn them they're heading towards a police speed trap. They usually wave to thank me as they slow down. There are no police."
I've got a shower with glass sliding doors and whenever I come out of it I pretend I'm Alan Sugar entering the boardroom.
"As a child I saw what I thought was a Cadburys mini egg on the floor and proceeded to stamp on it as hard as I could, only to realise it was an actual bird egg that had fallen out of a nest, I still feel guilty 30 years on."
My flat overlooks a car park for the block. Sometimes when I'm bored I will post on Nextdoor and inform the neighbours that the convicted shoplifter from flat 2 has been checking car doors again. The car park instantly becomes a disco.
I was desperate for a pre-gym snack so grabbed a bag of something in a rush en route from the garage. Gobbled them up in the dark during the drive. Only when I checked the next morning did I find I'd worked my way through a bag of dog treats
"When cooking, I don't put offcuts of chilli or bits of left over jarred jalapeños in the compost bin as I'm not sure how bugs and worms are with the Scoville scale."
"Every morning I bring my partner a coffee in bed, I have done so since the day she first stayed over. She thinks it's so sweet but it's actually because I need to be out the room for my extra loud morning fart."
"My mum had a holiday photo from Mallorca in the early 80's. One of her pals looked really hot in a bikini.It was often used as a bit of wank material. I had to put my thumb over my mum's face on the go-to picture, as I felt guilty that she was visible."
I have started to use my in-ear speakers as an invisible means to clean my ears in the office. I twist and turn them around so that they literally scrape out the earwax which I then roll into a little ball that I surreptitiously drop under the desk.
I have a document on my computer with my desert island discs and talking points about my largely mundane life. I know I will never be invited on the programme.
"After 28 years, cheating ex left for a younger woman. That Xmas the kids wanted him at the house. When cooking I put on a latex glove. Stuck one finger up each of the dogs bums and wiped them across his plate and let it dry on. Watching him mop up the gravy was pure pleasure."
"I used to work for a car company that collected and delivered very high end cars: Mercedes, Porsche, Ferrari etc. I always made sure I picked my nose and left a little bit under every seat."
"After stumbling onto a naked beach, I am terrified about what aging will do to my balls"
"My wife has no ability to financially plan - no pension,saving or anything. She will die in poverty as she spends everything. I save and know she will be entirely dependent on me. I'm considering a divorce because losing 50% now is just cheaper."
I seriously applied for a retail job in my local shopping centre because it was at a great location for Pokemon Go
"A very stylish man in a noisy bar complimented me on my shirt and asked where it was from. When I told him he said 'New York you say? Love it there, been a few times'. Rather than talk with him about fashion, I left the bar immediately. I had said 'New Look' and he misheard me."
"At uni I went to see Shed 7. They were sleeping on a tour bus. Post gig I went out, but stopped by the bus on the way home at 3am. Rick Witter, reasonably, refused to come and say hello, so I stuffed a bottle & kebab up the exhaust. Bus was still there 3pm next day. Sorry Rick."
"To the gay couple in the rural welsh village who stopped holding hands when I kept looking. I'm sorry! I was only looking because it was so cute! Sincerely, another gay man."
I bought a sanwhich today from M&S. I ate it in Costa.
"My girlfriend is stunning, I'm not even being bias as her boyfriend she's beautiful and models regularly has over 15k insta followers etc- but fuck me going anywhere is a nightmare constantly wanting videos/photos for 'the gram' we take hours to do anything if theres 'good light'"
"One drunken night I stayed in a strange house and around 4am I needed a poo, but all the doors were closed and I didnt know which was the toilet. One door took me to the kitchen, which led outside, and in desperation I took a shit in the back garden."
"Sometimes I'll wake my wife in the middle of the night with tender touching of her body, moving slowly from the affectionate to the erotic to full blown passionate lovemaking. This is normally because her snoring is annoying me."

"One night in a large hotel I woke up naked realising I'd locked myself out of my room while sleepwalking. I looked round to see a guard running down the hall toward me, I panicked, banged on the door hoping my GF would open the door and save me. It opened, it wasn't my door."
"Just won £81 on the lottery. Given I pay for the tickets every month, I have judged this amount to be below the reportable limit needed to inform my wife. I will therefore be spending it on records and craft beer. Not sorry."
I'm a 50yr old guy with a strong science & technology background but whenever I type in a password I always think about random nonsense words to try and mislead anyone attempting to read my mind
"When I take a minicab, at the end of the ride, I tell the drive I'm a senior driving test examiner and you indicated 6 out of 14 times - depending on the length of the journey - and you should drive better. I'm not. In fact it took me 3 attempts to pass my test."
"Since lockdown started, I've watched 1,700 episodes of The Bill during work hours and no one has noticed. Hopefully I'll see all of them before I'm back full time."
"It takes around 20mins to mow our lawn but my wife has never used a lawnmower, so she doesn't know this. I always do it when she's out and report back that it took a couple of hours, freeing up significant 'me' time that'd otherwise have additional tasks allocated to it."
"I wanted to get into bird watching so I spent £1,500 on a pair of Swarovski binoculars. On my first trip out I only saw two pigeons."
"My brother is an absolute cock end. When he comes to stay I will always wait until he takes a shower, then flush the downstairs bog and run a couple of cold taps. I then listen out so I can hear him moaning about being boiled/frozen alive. It's one of my greatest pleasures."
I'm a postman and there was a guy on my delivery who died of covid last winter. His car still sits on his driveway. On the back seat sits his work bag stuffed with his flask and uniform ready for work. It brings a lump to my throat everytime I walk past it.
"I struggle with basic math, sometimes having to use my fingers to do sums. As part of my job I oversee the payroll for an employer with over 150 staff"
"I always offer to make drinks in the office. People think it's because I'm caring and friendly but the truth is, all the others make tea/coffee that tastes like shit."
"I'm sure it was annoying that ebay didn't side with you in the dispute over the £5 purchase in 2014, but if I have to hear you furiously recount the story once more I swear I will leave you."
Our kid goes into a trance for an hour watching an old dvd compilation of kid's tv shows. It's become her daily routine. So it's also the daily routine for my fiancé and I to go downstairs and have sex. So much so that I'm starting to get turned on by the pingu theme tune.
"When I met my wife I'd just lost 1.5 stone & was almost back into my fav shirt. 5 years later I'm nearly 4 stone heavier & every attempt to lose weight, including one to make my tight fitting wedding suit comfortable, has failed. She also put on 2 stone. We both look shocking."
"When I was 5, mum let me design my own Guy for the bonfire. I made one that looked like my reception class arch-enemy and called him his name."
"In 1996 I was ghosted by a frankly mediocre lad I'd been dating. In revenge I sent a postcard to his shared flat, the message was a limerick which started: There is a young man called Paul/ Whose penis is terribly small. "
Still makes me giggle.

After eating my partner makes at least 2 hours of old person clearing throat noises & coughing because food gets stuck in his throat. The GP & hospital says nothing wrong & probably all in his head. The routine after eating is so annoying I'm considering serving him pureed food.
"I played Dungeons & Dragons as a teen, and for a while in college. I've never told my wife. For 2 years before the pandemic I started playing again with a few blokes from work. My wife thought I was doing night classes. I'll need a new excuse when we start again. I'm 48."
"As an 11 year old gifted an air rifle for Christmas, I shot a blue tit on a whim at my grandparent's house. I covered it with an old bucket, thinking I shouldn't have done that. Next time I went up my granddad asked me not to do it again. Still embarrassed 30 years later."
"I'm 40 and living on past glories. I have a great job because I was sharp in my early 30s, but now scrape by on past reputation. I got with my wife in our 20s when she was the one punching above her weight, now she's way above my league. Can't be long before I lose it all."
"I've gotten into the habit of saying oof, that's better out loud after a wank."
"Watching my fiftysomething contemporaries struggling with their parents' ill health makes me glad mine died when I was young. It was horrific at the time, but thank god it's behind me, not ahead of me."
"At a sex party, I overshot my partner and spunked on a French guy's leg. Just saw him again at another party. I was with a different partner. Got her to give him a handjob. She had no idea why, but it was my way of saying sorry."
"The Daily Mail taught me to wank. Aged 10, read a story in it about some MPs who watched strippers perform 'simulated masturbation'. Didn't know what that meant, looked it up in the dictionary. Years of pleasure followed. Thanks, Daily Mail!"
"I am a 40 year old man, 100% hetero all my life, but due to their uncanny resemblance to a barmaid I once had a dabble with many years ago, I now quite fancy Baga Chipz"
"'The Book People', once a month would leave a pile of new books and an order form in our offices. I used to use the photocopier to make copies of all the best recipes from the cook books."
If the food waste bin is getting full I'll just flush the food straight down the toilet. I feel this is acceptable because I'm just cutting out the middleman.
"Work has powerbanks at every desk in case of powercut. I once went round at the of the day switching them all off thinking they were CPUs, in an effort to save energy. The number of disasters the next day as terminals suddenly logged off mid-job was horrifying. I was off that day"
"I have my own special code when I sign off emails. Just my name means we're okay. Thanks, mildly annoyed. Regards, I'm not happy. Kind Regards, I hate your face and hope bad things happen to you. I find this quietly empowering."
"My boyfriend's big toe is thicker than his willy, when he put it inside me I came almost instantly. I didn't tell him out of embarrassment"
I've moved to a city 150 miles away. I say it's for the family but in fact I fell in love with a colleague 6 years ago and I just can't be even in the same town as her any more.
"I never get sick, but I make sure I have a couple of sick days every year just to mentally decompress."

"When doing A Levels, a mate and I qualified for small loan of £80 each for art materials,we bought a sheet of Dancing Testube 'tabs' sold enough to recoup our cash and tripped the light fantastic free for 3 months."
My wife sings harmonies to the 'Friends' theme and its honestly cringeworthy. Whenever I hear her murder 'I'll be there for you' I die a little inside. I'm no fan of Friends and she's not a bad singer but this is a real blind spot of hers. I wish I could tell her.
My wife recently bought me a mug for a significant birthday. In some ways I feel it justifies my affair
"I have 2 broken teeth causing me severe pain, but because of my poor dental hygiene growing up, I can't face a dentist to get the pulled due to the fact they'll ridicule me making me feel worse. I'll soon turn 30 knowing I'll have to deal with the pain forever."
"Worked with this lad once, I opted to do the run for our lunch. Bacon butties, I'd nick a rasher or 2 from his & place it in mine, the silly bastard would complain how my sandwich was packed compared to his which he accepted was because the lady at cafe must fancy me. Sorry Dave"
My partner just shouted loudly in the bathroom. Seems he dropped his phone down the loo. I could not feel more glee! Serves him right for never putting it down.
My dad got a 286 computer for his business when I was at the right age to be into every bit of it. I got into the BIOS and changed the hard drive settings turning it into a £3k brick. I never admitted it to him.
"Teacher here - I got into school one day so hideously hungover that, desperate for carbohydrates, I stole a load of sandwiches from the kids' lunchboxes when they were out at playtime."
For over a week I've been enjoying the best toast ever for breakfast. Having real butter makes so much difference. It's far better than the spreadable shite we normally have. Then my wife asked where the Lard she bought to make seed balls for the birds had gone. I said nothing.
"Mid 90s. Finally got with a girl I'd been after at a party, gave her a good noshing. Back downstairs, mates started chanting 'porridge stirrer' as one of them had shagged her earlier. Didn't argue, rather be known as a stirrer than an eater."
The best thing about working from home is when your partner goes into the office and you can spend all day wanking between calls. I'm reminded of this when I see a stray pube on my keyboard
"I grew up poor and we couldn't afford video games/toys. I now have a well paid job and when I visit video game stores I always come out with a new game or figurine. The cashiers often say my kids must adore me since I always get them new stuff. I'm 36, divorced, and have no kids"
"I attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace to celebrate British world champions. Walking around I spied Frank Bruno, and quietly asked for his autograph. All I could find was a stray KingSize Rizla, which he signed in good humour and sent me on my way! Smoked it years later!"

"I'm a very bored professional artist, who like so many others have had to compromise what I want to paint to make sales to pretentious second home owners. All my paintings have a cock hidden in them like where's wally."
"I have set up multiple monthly charitable donations made via mobile phone to be charged to my work mobile. The bills aren't itemized so nobody's ever noticed. They're a huge multinational, £50 a month is totally inconsequential to them."
Primary school around 1986. Oldest children were allowed to help sell the sweets at the school run tuck shop during break. I stole my body weight in fizzy cola bottles before they decided to stopped and just had teachers doing it.
One time while drunk me and a mate got a UV pen and wrote who's the cunt with the UV light then over everything in sight. It started with the work laptop and ended with the magnolia walls of the rented flat we were about to move out of. Still chuckle whenever I think about it.
"My girlfriend in university used to give me hand jobs and shoot the cum across the carpet of our rented accommodation as she was fascinated by how far it went. We did this, often, for the years we rented the property. She's now my wife and we don't do that to our own carpet."
I don't like people to the point I've become ridiculously good at DIY to avoid having strangers come into my house to fix things. I've probably wasted quite a lot of money on mistakes though.
"I lament the days when tradesmen had their home phone numbers on their vans. When they cut you up on the road, you could ring up their Mrs at home, say you were the police and make up some shit you need to speak to their husband about. Cause him a load of shit when he got home."
"I left my Scout group knowing it would be shut down if it lost one more member. Others approached me at school begging I return on the leader's behalf, even if just until they pass annual appraisal. I refused. It got shut down. I didn't dislike Scouts, I was just drunk on power."
One April fools day when i was 12. I put a drawing pin on a teachers chair and she sat on it. A guy in my year got the blame because he was seen beside her chair. That was the final straw and he got expelled. Never told anyone that before
"I work as a recruitment consultant and for years whenever someone applies for a job who works for a letting agent i reject them straight away. Those fuckers have ruined my life down the years, they can stay miserable in their jobs."
"Whenever we're watching Netflix on a laptop, my girlfriend moves the mouse to the side of the screen, so a slither of white shows over the full screen show we're watching. It's unbelievably medial but I feel like throwing the laptop out of the window every time she does it"
In the late 90s I worked 12 hour shifts in a dark factory that made the foam chips used in packaging to protect things like your new stereo. Kept myself entertained by dropping pornographic playing cards into random bags - hope you were one of the lucky blighters who found one.
"If I'm close to a cash machine and see someone heading quickly towards it, I'll swoop in first and spend ages checking my balance, just to piss them off."
I constantly slag off board game enthusiasts but I'm secretly jealous that they have a group of friends that they can hang out with over a shared interest
"I frequent two branches of Caffè Nero, and always order one of two things. If the staff ever try to pre-empt my order, I always ask for the other one, to avoid becoming enslaved to the tyranny of the usual."
I recently had a wank and the only thing I had to wipe it off was an FFP2 mask lying around on my desk. A few days later I was wondering why it smells like cum in public transport. The mask even had visible yellow stains on the outside.

"As a very minor elected politician I get my share of angry / obnoxious messages. The calculation we all make is would this person vote for me anyway. Mainly the answer is no and their message is ignored. If you want help with your issue, be kind to the person you are asking."
I live in a tower block opposite a big hotel. No need for internet porn just have to watch the various sex lives of people who don't close the curtains.
"Put my vibrators, butt plugs etc in the dishwasher on a Sunday night for a deep clean. My cleaners came a day early and I came home to find them arranged neatly on my bed. Absolutely mortifying."
"One of the first things I did in my new job was to set the clocks to the correct time on the microwaves in the staff kitchen. Don't know if anyone else cares, but it made me happy"
When moving house a family friend helped us clean our old house. Upon moving the sofa she declared oh my god there's mouse droppings . They weren't. They were years of my roled up bogies. Never told her the truth though
"Had to have one of my balls removed - I tell you what, there's a lot more room down there now. You should consider it even if you don't have cancer."
"I've just woken up seemingly halfway through a phone call with my line manager. I think I managed to blag my way through the call, but have no idea what I've agreed to."
"I trimmed my pubes yesterday while at my computer desk and left them in a tissue. Put that in the bin, I thought. I didn't. What I did do was sit down at my desk just now, feel a sneeze coming, grab that pube filled tissue and-- inhale so fucking many of my own pubes."
"I saw a poem I liked when I was 9 and palmed it off as my own, my mum was so proud she showed my teacher and it was entered into a national competition and I won and had to read it out in a huge assembly knowing I was stood on a stage of lies."
Everytime I go my parent's home my asthma flares up badly due to the dust and aging plaster. I now realise all my endless childhood lung issues were mainly down to being allergic to our house.
I often run a VPN before downloading podcasts. On at least three occasions I've heard someone comment on how they didn't expect to have so many fans in Mongolia; you don't.
"Aged 14, my friends and I were photographed in the local rag turning our backs on Prince Andrew who was opening a new building in town. The paper was full of letters complaining about the disrespectful youth of today. I think that we were genuinely ahead of the curve."
"Whilst studying at Hertfordhsire Uni in 2004 we would occasionally roam the student halls throwing water balloons through any open windows we spotted. Only occurred to me later that we might have ruined a few laptops, still feel guilty."
When I use cut & paste on my phone touchscreen I think what I have just cut is stored in my finger and I can't use that finger to touch anything else until I've pasted what I cut where I need it.
"In school hours our local Shell had door security to stop us nicking. I adapted and took products to the video rental aisle and hid them in empty cases, returning at night to safely retrieve my stash. Once saw a guy renting a porno, the lady opened the box to reveal a Twix."
"The only reason I'm really coping with my boyfriends drug addiction, is that every few days when he finally crashes and burns, I get to spend the whole day cuddling him and looking after him. Recently, It's the only time it feels like he allows me to love him."

"I like to go to websites where women take their clothes off for money, and pay them to draw pictures of what they think their viewers look like. None of them have quite captured me yet but some of the efforts have been genuinely wonderful."
"My partner likes to have the TV volume on an even number. When he's not looking I change it to an odd number and sit there feeling smug at the idea that if he knew it was an odd number he'd flip his shit. Don't even know why I do it, but it satisfies me."
My ex husband is marrying a woman with the same name as me. The urge to regift the framed personalised wedding day cross-stitch that my sister made us is almost too strong. I'd have to unpick the date though.
One Halloween we found an old lady who couldn't speak English but knew to give us 50p each. We were still knocking the door in December saying trick or treat and the 50ps kept on coming.
"Sometimes I travel via train for work, if a train is delayed I claim and keep the money. I also claim the time back for the delay from work."
The official photo used by our local mayor has the word CUNT written across his forehead in a colour barely distinguishable from his skin tone. This is why you don't scream abuse at members of your own PR team.
"I'm a waitress at a venue that does at least 2 weddings a month. Over 4 years of working there, I shagged, 8 best men, 2 bridesmaids, a groom and multiple times was offered a threesome with the married couple but they always backed out from after having a chance to sober up a bit"
"Having become jaded to all other pornography, I'm recreating my teenage jazzmag collection. I trawl eBay and specialist dealer sites for hours trying to spot familiar covers. It's costing £100s."
"Up until extremely recently, I believed spring water was only bottled in springtime"
"A random cheery stranger once jumped into my car and greeted me with a hearty ALRIGHT DICKHEAD? to which I replied I've no idea who you are mate. He immediately apologised and left. This should really be his confession, but I couldn't be bothered waiting any longer."
I had the hots for my friend's husband. At a dinner party I hosted he was flirting with me like hell & got me so horny I jumped on my hubby as soon as they left. I fell pregnant with my daughter that night. I often want to thank him.
"Back in medieval times when men were men, they would wee sitting down because standing up for a wee leaves you vulnerable to attackers who can surprise you behind. I have no proof of this - it's just the reason I give for not using urinals. I get terrible stage fright."
"My life is so boring now, to mix it up this Friday I turned my work pc off rather than putting it in Power save mode. Christ almighty I need a life."
Just swept through the bookshop with my phone camera finding books to order from the library.
When I'm alone in the house I like to vape in front of the mirror and walk through the cloud like I'm in Stars in their Eyes.
A few years ago I unfortunately ran over and killed the family cat as she was asleep under my car. To this day the family think she was hit by someone else on the road. The truth would really upset my kids.

When my stepdad tragically died in a motorcycle accident at the age of 38. My mum asked me to go through his phone to delete his social accounts. Found out he had been having an affair for at least a year. Haven't told a soul.
"30 years ago I was 19, me and a pal took ecstasy in a club. It was quiet and sat in the loos I knocked over and broke a glass. The sound was ace. We got a load of glasses and kept smashing them, launching them at the wall full force in sheer delight at the noise. I still feel bad"
"With the launch of Metaverse, this reminds me that I was fired once because I spent too long having sex in Second Life whilst pretending to be a man-sized fox. I told my wife it was because of the recession."
I have absolutely zero idea what to get my wife for Xmas.
"Years ago promotion boards were held in the same room. I bought a 'spy' microphone hidden in a plug extension, put it in a socket and sat in a discreet spot outside in the car listening in to the candidates before me. Got all the questions and formulated my answers in advance!"
I am a secret knitter. My girlfriend is pregnant and I've had to invent an old lady at work who I attribute all the knitted garments to. I've even called her Nora. I fucking love knitting.
"I was in the Army for 24 years and the only things I learned was righty righty, lefty loosey when undoing bolts and how to open beer bottles with a belt buckle."
I thought my fridge had stopped working as there was a funny smell coming from it. So I threw it out and bought a new one. Turns out it was just the expensive cheese my gf had given me. The cheese stank out my new fridge too.
"I once masturbated by using a 'never ending grind' cheat whilst playing a popular skateboarding video game, which in turn makes the controller vibrate constantly."
"I often play a mental game on country roads, where I overtake an imaginary, slow moving vehicle on a blind bend that was delaying me. 9 out of 10 times there is a truck, car or tractor coming the other way. Don't do it for real."
I always take my wife's car to pick up fish and chips as I hate the stale smell of fried food and vinegar in my car
"Every time I recieve a fine from my local council for some tiny traffic infraction, I exact my revenge by sending them at least 10 random FOI requests. If they want my £60, I'll take up some of their time in exchange."
"Since hardly anyone's in my office building now, when I go to the bathroom I kick the stall door open like I'm SAS. This morning someone was doing his business in there. Sorry if I scared the piss out of you, but you REALLY should have made sure the door was locked."
"I've started learning Welsh. Never been there and no desire to go, just really want to know what Super Furry Animals are singing about."
When I was 15 I gave my money to a stranger in Harrow HMV & asked him to buy GTA San Andreas for me. Barely exchanged a word or a look. He just did it. I felt guilty. I hope he didn't feel guilty. Thanks mate. Loved that game & I didn't grow up to be a violent car thief.
"Our internet drops out when we use the microwave, sometimes if my partner is being particularly cunty and won't listen to reason I'll just microwave things while he's trying to game or watch Netflix. It doesn't achieve anything but it makes me feel better momentarily"

I am married with 2 kids. I love them all but I regularly search for houses online that I can live in by myself. Spend time planning the renovations I would do within my personal budget and then imagine my life as I live there in peace by myself
I bought my mother-in-law a mug which says 'If you were a flower I'd pick you' which she loves. Truth be told it's because a picked flower will most likely die in a week or so.
My ex released an album of unlistenable self indulgent crap. Anyway I've just smashed it to pieces. I had no idea it would be this satisfying.
Just had my 1st VR wank. Can't look my wife in the eye now. Feels like i cheated on her. Unreal.
In the 90's I worked on the YTS in a sports shop at a local shopping center. On my break I would go into the stock room and put on football socks and shorts under my clothes. Over the space of 3 months I kitted out my football team.
"In the early 00s me and my friends used to take turns buying a weekly bus pass, then rest of us then photocopied. They where kept in a little plastic wallet that you just flashed the driver so they never noticed it was on normal paper rather than a ticket."
"FROM ADMIN: Today is @robmanuel, the creator of Fesshole's birthday. And if you fancy buying him a sausage for his (my) hard work then it would make his (my) birthday that bit more sweet and sausage-y. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"At my old job, there was a witchhunt by my manager to find who got tomato sauce on a chair in the canteen, because he had sat there and ruined his favourite cashmere sweater. He quizzed over 40 people about where they sat at lunch. I can tell you, it was actually BBQ sauce."
"We had a school trip to the Houses of Parliament and at lunch ate in the canteen. Chose a panini and handed it over to be warmed up, lady handed it back and I was never charged. Spent the rest of the day worrying about it but now see myself as a modern day Guy Fawkes"
"I have an impressive looking large scar on my hand, and many people have heard about how I acquired it while disarming a crazy guy with a machete. The reality is that it was due to a cack-handed attempt at opening a can of paint with a kitchen knife."
"I used to work with someone who was so catastrophically shit at their job that much of my time was spent fixing basic fuckups caused by their laziness and ineptitude. When they left, the office had a whip round and I pretended to put in some money but I actually took out £20."
There is a road safety sign nearby that says 30 for a reason. Whenever I see. It I can't stop myself from singing let the reason be love and I hate myself for it.
"I'm in my late forties and set up a WhatsApp group for me, my brother's and cousins to arrange night's out etc."
It's only gone and been hijacked by my mum and aunties. It's now a nightmare and when I left I was berated by my mum for lack of family loyalty.

"When I was 12-13, my best friend and I stole packs of Pokemon cards from local shops and sold the shinies at school, making hundreds of pounds. We never got caught."
"I despise my neighbour. So when he was away this summer, rather than just throwing snails over the fence into their garden like I normally do, I put them in a bucket, nudged open their back gate and went round attaching each hungry snail directly to one of their new plants."
"Back in the 00's I used to work in the atm section in the bank. It was a 24hr operation. If I was out on a Saturday night and queues were big at an ATM. I would ring my friends in the office and ask them to close it. The queue would disperse, then ask him to turn it on again"

When my girlfriend isn't here at night I can only sleep if I put all the spare pillows along her side of the bed against me
"Our 16 yr old went to an overnight party, except he came home at 10pm instead of staying the night. We thought we had the house to ourselves, we were so very, very wrong. He caught us in the middle of an intense BDSM session, Dad was sub. We're currently not making eye contact."
"In Airbnbs, if there is a guestbook I look for gaps in timeline and add in fake reviews for the missing dates. Generally I add fairly vague comments relating to paranormal activity mixed in with your usual review stuff."
I used to wipe snots all over the chairs in my workplace. Everyone in the office was angry and had no clue who was doing it. People had started to suspect it was a fairly scruffy colleague. When he left for a new job I made myself stop to confirm to everyone else it had been him.
"I was given some lint rollers. I couldn't work out why they only removed cat hair from about half a jumper before they stopped working and I had to throw them in the bin. About six months later, I saw my new gf peel the top layer from one and carry on rolling...."
"In order to ensure my socks are used equally, there is a particular order of wearing that I've established by not having any pair the same as another and I know the order they must be worn in. It's the one secret I keep from my partner."
"I tell the students I teach at school that the button that makes the bell ring is in my stock cupboard. When it is about to ring I tell them I've decided it's time and go into the cupboard. It rings when I'm in the cupboard. It fools Year 7 but, worryingly, the Y13 too."
"I'm wondering if the work colleague who's been pinching my dilute orange juice will ever realise that I've spotted it happening and they have, for 3 months now, been drinking orange juice and urine."
Around 10 years ago I would now and again see a well-known Hollywood action movie star at my gym. I would often try to get on the treadmill right next to him and pretend we were in a movie running away or towards something.
"I get into work early so I can leave early, the only reason I do this is to be able to have a large scotch before my wife gets home. My life is great but I can't function with it."
"As a middle manager, lockdown homeworking was a triumph. As I was less available to my minions they had to sort their own shit instead of running to me. So I now have more capable minions, and get more praise for working less hard, since I can focus more on headline-grabbing shit"
There was a way you could send a contact to early 2000s Nokia phones over Bluetooth and the name would just pop up on screen. I used to send free pint when you show this at the bar in pubs and sit back and watch the arguments when they couldn't redeem.
"At comprehensive school, i would go into town at lunch time and steal books from WH Smith. I'd then go to a second hand book stall in the local market and sell them on. Did this for years and it funded my underage drinking."
"A relative doesn't let her child have anything unicorn related, as unicorns are not real. I let her daughter pick out the My Little Pony that looked like a unicorn, and pretended I didn't notice it had a horn. She was fuming."
I'm a 48 year old happily married man and I'm pretty sure that I'm not alone amongst my peers in that: all anyone has to do to engage me in a sexual act is convince me that it will remain our secret.
"Just had to cut a paracetamol tablet in two for my daughter and snorted the left over powder, as I have a bit of a cold and it made me feel like I was in my twenties again. I'm 51 and haven't had any cocaine for 25 years."

I've only just gotten over the impulse to look at the face of every single Magic Star before eating them. Feel like I've really matured.
I told my family I got pinged by the track and trace app to blag out of a wedding I really didn't want to go to.
A mate cheated on his wife on a stag do. One of the other lads texted him next day pretending to be the girl. He said we were all boring and he had a rampant foot fetish. We all cut him out when he got back and he has no idea why.
"I run a Twitter account where I claim to be a rich woman, with multiple children and a penchant for horses. So many people just accept it. I'm a 42 year old man who lives with his mum. It's got out of hand."
I like to make up elaborate life back stories whenever I get in a taxi because my actual life is dull AF.
"I make mean faces at the cat when my wife's not looking. The cat's not bothered but it makes me feel better as it's a little bastard. One day my wife will catch me at it though, and I'll be for the high jump."
"Not long after we broke up, my ex and a friend of hers both blocked me at the same time. It's now several months later so can I say: Dave, I know you shagged her and I know it went nowhere. But you're ruining the threading on my timeline, just grow up and unblock me"
"I've been a professional software developer for more than a decade and have so far never written a single unit test. Never even run a test, in fact. It's got to the point where it would be too embarrassing to ask how they work."
"Engineer here. When we say leave it with me we generally mean: I don't give a shit about this right now, if you're lucky I'll look at it in a week and get round to it if I can be fucked"
I like to wee the shit stains off of public toilets. It's my little way of giving back to the community. I'm just a skid-mark vigilante.
"Whenever I pick off my dog's crusty eye boogers from the corner of his eyes, he eats them - he goes mad for them, it's now at the stage where he's salivating when I go to clean his eyes. Tempted to give them a taste to see what the fuss is all about."
"Once got a petty negative Google review from a guy who didn't want to pay our reasonable prices to get his laptop repaired. Went onto FB, found his girlfriend and sent her an anon tip-off to check the contents of his Recycle Bin. No regrets."
"I used to have crippling imposter syndrome, leading to constant anxiety about my well paid job. Since Boris Johnson somehow became PM, I realised people don't give a shit about incompetence and am genuinely much happier coasting along caring and doing the bare minimum."
"I have a friendship that is sustained purely by our mutual love of cheese. Any time something cheese related happens, we go together. Cheese markets, a restaurant with a super cheesey burger, etc.Truth is; I'm not THAT in to cheese. I just fancy the pants off of her."

"I occasionally go to drink from my cup, not realising I've already finished it. Rather than just putting my cup down and risk looking a bit silly, I take an imaginary gulp, then put it down."
"I'm 24 and tried staying a virgin till I found the right person for me, even held back kissing so that I can have a special memory of the first time. All for nothing as I lost my virginity at an ecstasy-fueled party yesterday and I honestly regret having waited this long."
"When I was 7-8, when my dad would piss me off by telling me off when I hadn't done anything wrong, I would purposely scratch his Xbox game discs. He'd always be confused why his games wouldn't work and wasted around £50 replacing them"
"I'm a 47 year old man. When I walk my dog late at night and there's nobody else around, I skip along the road."
"I lost my father this year. I still have our last conversation saved on WhatsApp. For a while I would open it and it would continue to say his last online presence. I still open it, hoping one day it'll change and it was all a dream."
I take my wedding ring off when I have a wank partly because I feel it would be disrespecting my wife to keep it on during.
"Now I've turned 60, I have no interest in going to the gym, dying my hair or whitening my teeth, but I have started plucking my eyebrows. No way am I going into my golden years looking like Dennis Fucking Healey."
"Every time I get a birthday reminder in Facebook, I use it as an opportunity to delete friends I don't really know that well. Occasionally I think, oh what if they realise I've unfriended them on their birthday? But then I think, fuck it"
I had a really vivid dream that Ricky Gervais was bumming the arse off me while dressed as the devil. It was fucking amazing and I'd probably let him do it irl if he asked.
"Went to my son's parents' evening at primary school, realised I had shagged his teacher many years ago, she realised it as well judging by her expression. Awkward but funny, never told my wife why the atmosphere was strange."
"A couple of months ago I spent £650 on a robotic hoover - my wife went nuclear!! It's utter shite tbh, but to save face I wait until she's gone out and then I get our vax out and let the robotic one take the credit."
"Even though I've never stolen anything, I always get very anxious when leaving a shop with electronic security gates"
My Mum died recently. My Dad 20 yrs ago. It is sad and they were good parents. When looking through old photos however it was those of our old dog that really pulled at my heart strings
"I never wipe my arse until its clean, just until I'm bored. Maybe 3-4 wipes tops."
I have just learned the hard way not to squat for a piss in the shower unless you're absolutely certain you don't also need a shit.
Facebook keeps serving up memories of my son when he was cute and happy. Now he's just a miserable slouching teen impressed by nothing. I miss my little boy so badly

I used to bunk off school with mates in the 80s go back to mine and call random people telling them I was a telephone engineer and their phone was dangerously overheating. Managed to get a sweet sounding old lady to unscrew the mouthpiece and cut a wire. What a little cunt I was
I like to flick through boxes of After Eight Mints imagining that I'm a giant DJ
I ate an entire box of peppermint creams last night. I didn't know that peppermint was a laxative. Now I know.
"My 1.5 year old son ate a cialis I inadvertently left on the bedside table. He had rosy cheeks for hours and never looked cuter. He also had a solid erection whenever we changed his nappy, which my wife found weird but she didn't know he'd been dosed with 20mg of blue pill."
"Ex has one of these smart home heating boilers, controlled by an app connected to Alexa. I still have it on my phone. I set it to come on full blast at regular intervals. Their energy bill must be huge."
My husband has been cheating on me & downright denied it when confronted. He gaslighted me but doesn't know that I know his phone PIN and have pictures of his messaging history. I'm now just playing along short term until I can inflict the most reputational & financial damage.
It's the best public confessions for October 2021 - a bumper month for amusement. Do share and follow @fesshole if you don't already - it all helps keep the material coming in https://t.co/IDqe2hiuyC
"I was once so lonely that I paid a sex worker to build lego sets with me. She did it dressed in lace and heels the whole time, which was impressive"
The only thing my siblings and I agree on is not wanting to have kids. It makes me sad to think that this line of the family ends here. My mother wants to be a grandmother but it will never be. It's the right thing to do. Life is painful pyramid scheme.
"Every time I'm out and go to the toilet, I fill the toilet brush holder up with piss. Started when I was young and still filling up to this day"
"I have a really honest relationship with my partner, I feel like I almost tell them everything. Apart from the fact I cheat at words with friends regularly. I sometimes feel guilty but playing an 8 letter word is a rush like no other."
"As a delivery guy, when I get to 69 I always look and think would I? Most of the time it's an old bloke waiting for his meds"
I got busted and taken home by the police for buying 6 bottles of vodka when I was 14. They handed over the booze to my folks and I slowly drank it and replaced it with water. My mother then donated the bottles to the church sale a few months later
"I frequently Google companies I hate and click on their ads, just to cost them a couple of quid. If enough of us do it, it will fuck their marketing funnel as well, so that they can't even figure out what to spend their money on. JOIN ME."
"My mother died in 2019, in awful pain from cancer in windowless room, in hospital. She asked me to help her die. My only regret, and a regret that haunts me, is that I didn't."
"Since getting an Echo Show 8, every visitor to the house can see I mostly play songs by Kunt And The Gang."
I've been with my wife for 11 years and I have ex's that would recognise the same 3 sets of bedding I've had in rotation. One set I had as a teenager living at my parents. Might be time to invest.

"After a three dates with a very nice guy, we booked a night away in London. He texted me on a couple of days before and said I can't wait to get my tongue in your dirt box. I dumped him and didn't do the trip."
"When I was 14 my Dad left us for a waitress at his restaurant. A few months later I found his camcorder and a video of them at it. I also found £5k of his savings in an envelope. Spent the lot. Fuck you, Dad."
"My best mate broke his hand and I was asked to act as a scribe in his GCSEs. He spoke answers, I'd write them down. We had a code: if he lifted his finger, he didn't know the answer and I would write my answer. I passed 6 GCSEs for him."
I once cancelled a second date with girl I met on a dating app at very short notice because it was really cold. She didn't want to see me again. A year later I saw on her FB that she had got married. It haunts me and I'm still single.
"Glastonbury 2013, I forced my way to the front of the pyramid stage for Arctic Monkeys' headline slot holding a cheap DSLR camera aloft and claiming to be the 'man at the front' for NME. Sorry to everyone I snapped that night, no, you'll never be appearing in the mag."
I'm a reasonably well-known author. I like nothing more than buying my own books for £2 on eBay so I can autograph them and sell them at a profit.
"When my wife is lecturing me I pay close attention to find words with each letter of the alphabet in alphabetic order. I end up listening intently and she seems to think it has gone in, it rarely does, but her saying 'zealous' just made me fist pump."
There's a play in which dead people get to pick one memory in which they'll live for all eternity. My wife asked me what I'd choose. I said a day at the beach with our kids. But really it'd be a night I once spent in a hotel with a gorgeous redhead who loved to be spanked.
"I once met Aphex Twin in a club, and told him I was a big fan. He then asked which album I liked and I couldn't name any."
As a child I was always told by my parents that my shoes should have lots of extra room for my toes. I continued to buy shoes on this basis for most of my life. I had my feet measured recently and realised I had been buying shoes that were two sizes too large. I am 51 years old.
Phones face recognition stopped working for 12hrs after a weekend on ket
"My wife has completely gone off sex in her late thirties. We've talked about it and she doesn't think it's a big deal. I'm beginning to really resent her, but I can't bear that he thought of not waking up in the same house as my kids. Feeling lost."
"Every party I went to, I'd use their landline and place a wake-up call at 5am the next day. Did this for 10+ years. Only quit because people quit using landlines."
"During lockdown I've started sticking my hand down my pants and holding my penis during Zoom calls: not sexual, just feels comforting, and nobody can see it on camera. Yesterday I found myself doing it unconsciously once back in the office. Hoping nobody noticed."
"I'm 45, and I've given up wanking. Since doing so, I have the best sex with my wife, with orgasms that blow my mind. The sweet spot is about a week between sessions."
I've left a someone on unread for three years. The constant WhatsApp notification is incredibly annoying but at least I can say I didn't see your message if I bump into them

"The only reason I am still with my partner is because I simply cannot be bothered dealing with and moving all my crap out, it just seems too hard."
I have £45k sitting in my bank account and can't do anything with it. I won it on a betting site. My wife and family hate gambling and would divorce and disown me if they knew I gambled.
"When holidaying in Palma Nova as a child, I made friends with other kids in the hotel. As a prank we put DO NOT DISTURB signs on a few door handles, so the maids wouldn't clean the rooms.An old man had passed away in one of the rooms and his body wasn't discovered for days."
I love lost lager by Brewdog which claims to be the first carbon negative beer. I question that claim as it makes me fart a great deal and there is no way I'm planting fucking trees to offset my foul stench.
My boyfriend and I wanted to recreate 9 and a half weeks by eating food off each other. The other day I found a bit of donut up my vagina that had been there a while the name Krispy Kreme is going to haunt me forever.
"When shopping I furtively grab plastic carrier bags from under the till at Lidl or Aldi, crumple them up in my hands as I wait, and as it looks like they aren't new, I don't have to pay for them."
When my wife isn't in earshot I skip pages in the children's bedtime stories. I find it so utterly boring and if they don't notice me skipping pages then they clearly aren't following the storyline.
"Like most people during lockdown, me and the wife set up an OnlyFans for her. Waste of time. Spent 4 months of every evening and weekend dedicated to pics and promoting on Twitter to get around £500. Couldn't quit our jobs but had a nice weekend in London."
"I always grill my bacon as it's 'healthier'. However, if I'm on my own or no one is looking, I'll lick up the fat left in the grill pan."
"I have had the same bank card PIN since 1992, same for all my cards, never changed it since the first card I owned"
Had to go to A&E after I tore off a whole fingernail at work. Told my colleagues it got trapped in a closing door as I was too embarrassed to tell them it actually happened when I tried peeling a particularly thick-skinned orange.
"My manager asked me to help out on another project, I did and that project finished about a month ago and I've not told anyone. I watch YouTube videos for 8 hours a day and no one's said anything yet."
"Over lockdown I lost a considerable amount of weight. I wish I hadn't. If I bang an arm or something it hurts without my layer of protection, sitting on a bony arse is uncomfortable and non of my clothes fit."
"I sincerely hope that, if anything happens to me, nobody discovers the 188 farts I've recorded on my phone. This includes 33 I favourited because I particularly enjoyed them."
Had my bum cheeks and crack waxed for the first time recently. I'm enjoying the feeling but my farts are now noisier. Seems the hair acted as a diffuser.
When I'm on the train I look around and judge everyone to determine what role they would play in a post apocalyptic world in case a real life version of the 90s tv drama 'The Last Train' happens

"Mistakenly gave the wrong date of my mother's death to be carved on my father's headstone. Saw the mistake as soon as I visited the grave. It will cost £1,000 to fix it. Next year, the family is gathering to inter her ashes and I plan to say nothing and hope they don't notice."
"I let a well dressed gentleman carrying a briefcase into the office as I was leaving for home He said he was there to fix a computer upstairs, I just wanted to go home so let him in. He nicked several laptops and spent £1000s on the company credit card. I never told a soul."
There is a cum stain on my vintage leather sofa that is from when my daughter was conceived 10 years ago. Sometimes I will stare at it for hours morning her millions of brothers and sisters that didn't make it and are now mummified on my couch for eternity.
"Rather than plagiarise my undergrad dissertation and risk getting caught, I simply invented half my bibliography and quoted from it at length. Seemed more elegant."
I've just been reliably informed that the small spare towel I used to dry my arse and balls - and occasionally wipe my dribbly cock on - is in fact a hand towel. Sorry to anyone who's ever stayed at our house!
I do doggy daycare and I look after the hounds as if they were my own…including the occasional day when I'm so hungover they only get 30 mins walk and we spend all day sleeping on the sofa.
"I once walked round a corner too fast in Tesco and bumped into a little old lady, she was mildly jostled but unhurt. Trouble is, in my panic I went to say both I'm so sorry! and are you ok? at the same time, resulting in it coming out as ARE YOU SORRY?!"
For our first weekend together at my girlfriends flat I took 3 Imodium so I wouldn't need a shit. On Sunday night in bed I squeezed out a little fart only for it to be followed by a massive foul smelling cable. Sorry Jane.
Had a beer with a mate from years back who reminded me that somewhere in my mum's garden is the vibrating vagina I buried there in 1990.
"I've spent the last few years pretending to colleagues that I'm a few years younger than I really am, but after 18 months of not seeing any colleagues I can't remember how old I said I was just before lockdown. What if I end up even younger?"
"Started using my wife's Vagiwash stuff to take care of my own bumhole and I can tell you my ringpiece has never felt so clean. Get onto it chaps, it's a new world down there"
"At the peak of the Irish troubles I phoned my local department store and, in my best Irish accent, informed them there's a bomb. My grinning preteen friends and I rode round on our BMX bikes to find the police rushing in and the staff rushing out. We never spoke about it again."
My wife is convinced salt is evil and you don't need seasoning to make food taste great. She has no idea that every time she cooks I add the salt and pepper her cooking is crying out for whilst she's out the room. She cooks most nights and we've been married 12 years.
"One Xmas Day I received a text message from a number I didn't recognise, saying 'Happy Christmas, I love you'. I was in a relationship at the time so ignored it. Have wondered ever since if it was a wrong number or a secret admirer, and how different my life could have been."
I inadvertently sat on my mum's favourite wooden chair and created at crack. The wood was a Nutella brown. You can work out the rest. I only got caught out weeks later when the dog started licking the chair every night.
In 6th form me & my mate spent a few months bunking off PE and raiding people's pockets in the changing rooms for cash which was spent on fags/weed/cans. We also raided the tuck shop kitty. Looking back im ashamed of that period but at the time we felt like absolute gangsters.

"My wife is a bit cheap and she buys the cheapest washing-up liquid. Whenever I'm washing up I use shitloads more than I should, just to get to the bottom of the bottle quickly. I can then go and buy proper Fairy Liquid and I also get proven right about how poor her choices are"
At school I used to take those little packets of butter and eat them on their own. Butter just tastes so damn good.
"When I was at boarding school, I sawed 3/4 the way through the back legs of the headmaster's chair in the dining hall. When he sat down, he smashed backward into the trophy cabinet. Piping hot soup poured onto his dog, which subsequently attacked him. I still feel bad."
"Half way through having covid, and during the illest I felt, I still could muster up the energy to have a wank. The orgasm felt very weird, almost like my body said 'bro, ffs'"
Since working from home I keep a roll of aluminium foil next to my desk. Any boring Zoom or Teams meetings and I stealthily wrap it over the wireless headset receiver and blame internet connection issues before a 15 minute laptop restart while I make a coffee and have a smoke
My husband has just called me fat. I've just googled an ex-love in retaliation. Just found ex has a good-reads account. I'm going to buy my husband some books my ex recommends and sit smugly as I watch him read them. If I didn't have kids I would get a divorce.
My fiancée looks truly awful in his new glasses. I'm not sure I can get married to him if he continues to wear them. I feel awful.
"I like to find email addresses of random people in companies and add it to any outstanding invoices that I send over if I'm getting no response from the client. Randomly shaming someone to a colleague, not even in the same dept., for not paying yields great results."
"I bought a Scalextrics set for my kids. Sorry kids, it was for me."
I hate it when my kids bring home cute artwork from school. They definitely notice if you throw it out and we've got folders and folders of the fucking stuff now
My boyfriend sat me down to ask if I was scared of living alone - he'd found a rolling pin under my bed. He assumed it was there for protection whereas actually I'd just misplaced my favourite dildo
"Late 90s young me worked in a PCB factory, had a defence contract for v.small boards. Didn't know what they were. Always used a router 1mm too big/small so never made it past quality check. Prob for something very innocuous but like to think I stopped a few folk getting blown up"
"No Time To Die: I took a 600ml bottle of Pepsi Max with me. I've done this many times, and it's never been a problem, but it's a long film. VERY long. Let's just say the empty bottle came in handy."
"When ironing I never stand the iron up, and instead leave it down flat. Over time it burns a hole in the cover. This is how my Nan did it, and it reminds me of her every time. Never told anyone, it's our little connection."
"Bought £50 of the cryptocurrency WHACKD, in '19. It was a protest currency from McAfee claiming that Epstein didn't hang himself. Waited for McAfee to pump it, he didn't. In June '21, McAfee 'hung himself' same as Epstein. The currency mooned, I made £25k from the man's death"
I really miss the music from In The Night Garden as my kids are teenagers now & obviously don't watch it anymore. I might have to start listening to it privately as it reminds me of happy times
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something illegal with a cd inlay?
"Bought my fiancee some sexy clothes online, now I'm rewarded with lingerie adverts to gawp at every time I check Facebook. Thank you, targeted advertising."
"When working away from home I often browse Adultwork for local sex workers, have a wank over their photos and the congratulate myself on the money saved by not arranging a booking with them. I'm about £3k up this year."
"Got into my van in Edinburgh and looked in the near side mirror. To my surprise I see a bloke hiding behind my van, taking a dump. I drove off and revealed him to everyone on the street. Sorry dude."
"When working at a supermarket a woman once asked me where something was, I was hungover and didn't know the answer, I told her to wait here and I'll find out, I never returned to her. I sometimes wonder if she's still there."
"My wife thinks I've been paying people to do work around the house, I just withdraw the money and do it myself. I then spend the money on sweets and fast food"
Every time I lock my car with the key fob I pretend I've just blown it up and am walking away without looking back.
Flatmate and I signed for a new place and he got the bigger room as he was paying more rent. I moved in first and noticed my mattress was much worse/older so quicker switched them before he moved in. No regrets.
I feel genuine deep shame and guilt over the way I shout at and treat my Henry Hoover. I'm not that person.
"Drunk one night I rescued a cat by bringing it home. It got in the fish tank, ran round the room & freaked out the dog. Kept jumping on my head, so let it out on the flat roof. Found out it was next-door-but-one's cat, so less rescued more catnapped. Soz."
My family often recount the tales of what a shit paperboy I was. That my dad had to do the round frequently. One tale of how he once walked in & found me asleep on the garage floor. Truth is I was cracking one off to the Daily Sport and got my cock away just in the nick of time.
"Whenever I have decorating to do, I always get 2 or 3 quotes and then do it myself revelling in the money I've saved"
"Whenever I'm asked my occupation, I tell people I'm a chef... I'm in charge of the fryer at a chippy."
Shuffling out of a crowded Underground Station I put my hand on my wife's back to guide and keep together. I then moved and squeezed her backside to realise it wasn't her. Got a look of disgust. Complete accident but felt like some sort of predator. So sorry.
"A lady in our village was giving away a fairly old audio/cinema system, I immediately put it on eBay and sold it for £50. I thought it was clever, my girlfriend thinks it was wrong."
"10 years ago my wife and I decided to send our kids to private school, one is now 16 and the other is 14, and I'm growing to resent the snobby shits they have turned into, every single conversation they now annoy me"
Apps which asks me for a star rating while I'm using it gets rated 1/5

I graduated a few years ago with a degree in data science. I'm currently being paid 3 salaries from 3 different companies for data analytics roles that I've written programmes for. Just send the odd email now and again.
I've just realised the guy I'm going out with looks a lot like Rolf Harris and I can't get past it. I tried subtly encouraging a hair cut change it looks good a bit longer you could leave it a bit but he likes how it looks.
"I regularly go on dating apps with fake profiles to boost my confidence, I've been married for 8 years with 2 kids but I can't stop."
"I'll never forget NYE in 1983. Got an invite in the post to a party in Leeds, with a written footnote wear a monkey suit. As they opened the door, I did a Ta-Daaa arms outstretched silly pose in my fancy dress chimpanzee outfit, only to be greeted by the host in a ball gown."
"Gf convinced our toilet was leaking as was constantly wet at the base. Said I'd have look, realised it was just my missed pan pissed. Told her I'd tightened some stuff and now sit down for a piss."
"My husband is a raging mansplainer and rather than suffocate him in his sleep, I clean the dogs teeth with his toothbrush."
"I made a pathetic excuse to avoid going to the pub with missus tonight because I know her friend's husband will be there banging on about deporting all the imigrants, and I'd probably get into trouble for punching a sixty year old ex-soldier in the throat."
"When picking up my dogs' poo from the garden, I give them a rating out of 10. I've been doing this for 12 years and have only awarded 10 once, for a beauty stood perfectly upright."
"As a paperboy in the early '90s I would regularly remove the page 3 girls from the Sun & Star from different customers. If there were topless shots of celebs, I'd have those as well. Built up quite a folder til my Mum found & binned the lot."
"My dad is a staunch Tory voter, and doesn't see the need for food banks, thinks they stop people from helping themselves. When I do his shopping I always buy something for the food bank on his behalf and donate to the trolley on the way out."
"My next door neighbour's a nice guy, yet he's also a local dealer. Asked me to point my security cam away from his house which I agreed to in return for a weekly payment in weed. It's a great arrangement and I'll miss him when I move house next year."
My partner's efforts to replace all the light fittings in our house with attractive ones which take small screwfit bulbs max 25 watts will be the end of us. I just want to see what i'm doing.
A few years ago I hinted to colleagues that I was going to a Freemason meeting to avoid a work social event. The lie has grown and I've had to tell one of the guys in Finance I would recommend him.
"I work at a Register Office doing Marriage Notices. Saw that my next appointment was a same sex female couple. Got them in, sat them down, and did my usual thing of Awww, you two are getting married! The younger one gestured to the other and said This is my mum."
"At middle school, I thought that Anon was the most prolific poet thanks to their many contributions in the various books we read."
"At the start of lockdown, my work sent me two high power iMacs so I could work from home. I asked about why two and the very stressed guy organising 500 people working from home said I don't have time for this son, just keep it. Sold it on eBay."

In my 20s I would sleep with any old guy regardless of how they looked if they lived fairly centrally or would pay for a cab to theirs. I lived far out and couldn't afford cabs and couldn't be bothered with nightbusses.
"Our school caretaker wore a thick ginger wig like Frankie Howerd. I'm not proud of it but we threw things at his shed to provoke his mad outbursts, which included Away home and play wi' yer cock! and Yer maw carried ye fer 9 months, she shudnae bothered. Sorry Jim."
My parents and I haven't talked in a decade. I find myself checking on their local obituaries just so I know when I can no longer dread a phone call.
"I hate with a passion the Brexiting boss of the chain pub from which I'm writing this confession, but, there's no way I'm boycotting somewhere I can get a 2 course sit-down meal including a drink for under a tenner."
In 2008 I went to Essex to get a clown costume from a friend emigrating to China. I stayed for his leaving drinks and got so drunk and stoned I couldn't work out how to get home. So I slept in a graveyard dressed in the clown costume for warmth until I sobered up.
"An Aussie client had us do a bathroom refurb in his UK home when he visited. Wasting our time & generally being a total twat. When he & his wife would go out we made small tin foil wraps of flour and slipped them in the lining of his suitcase, there must have been 50."
"I'm in my third year of university and I've made no friends, I've gotten into a serious relationship and now I'm worried that if we did get married then I'd have no bridesmaids or anything, It's embarrassing to admit I have no friends."
"I used to love the baby voice my partner gives my dog, but recently it's morphed into a spoilt kid with a midlands accent. Nothing against the midlands, but if my dog is my son, I don't understand why he would sound like that when his mommy 'n' dadday are from the south west."
"Sorry Lucas, it was me - not Josh from accounts - who tipped the contents of the ash tray in your briefcase at work in Spring 1987. Don't know why I did it since you're a decent bloke and it's haunted me ever since."
I've always refused to eat cheese. When my mum made a cheesecake when I was a kid she convinced me it didn't contain cheese. I continued to eat cheesecake whilst still saying that I didn't like cheese. I was married and in my thirties before I realised my mum was bullshitting me.
"I'm 6' 4, but I tell people I'm 6' 3 because it seems less intimidating."
I ordered Dominos Pizza for a year via PayPal and raised a dispute every time to get my money back. They don't check their disputes so you automatically win. I still don't know if they've fixed it.
"Currently in hospital following an operation and was given a private room, I have an urge to have a wank, but it's insanely difficult when they take my blood pressure & heart rate every hour"
"My mother was a massively manipulative narcissist. When she died me and my brother went on a massive booze and coke fuelled bender, 48 hours of us celebrating we never have to talk to old hag again. We never told no-one about what we did"
"My wife was a week overdue with our first. Heard that a good shag could induce labour. We started and she got her first contraction halfway through. I couldn't finish, ended up taking her to hospital and me having a massive wank in the maternity ward bogs so I'd have a clear head"
"My dad designed and made lead soldiers in his retirement. When he died I sold them all to his biggest rival, despite his wishes, for a song. It was either that or bin them or have them hanging round my house forever. I couldn't do it, sorry dad"
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something horrible with a beach hut?
"Set off uni halls fire alarm at 2am. Everyone in the building evacuated into the cold. Firemen identified our room, thought we'd been smoking cigars. Gave a warning and a 'boys will be boys' response. In truth I'd been setting hazelnuts on fire & then blasting them with deoderant"
"We've a legendary family story when I was about 8, I was found walking around downstairs with a 'weapon' late at night as I thought I'd heard intruders in the house. Nobody knows I was actually stealing crisps from the kitchen. The weapon was a backup plan in case caught."
"Although I live alone I watch porn in private browser mode, Bluetooth off and delete my history after doing the deed."
"After falling asleep blind drunk, I woke up spewing the donna kebab I demolished on the way home onto the brand new carpet. Panicked and ran to gather the cleaning products before my wife got home. Returned to find the dog had eaten my sick. Talk about man's best friend."
"Whenever I go to a club bathroom, I always wait for the cubical and pretend to do sniff, because I can't piss in the urinals and I don't want people to think I'm weird."
"I replaced the power circuit on a client's display TV. I had to wait weeks for the part to arrive. After replacing the board and it still didn't work, I found a small on/off switch set to off. The original was probably fine. I billed the client anyway."
"Some of the reasons I've broken up with girls are:Wanted me to talk dirty, and shouted at me if I didn't do it rightHad a tattoo on her back, right in my eyeline, of her dead catBrushed her teeth with hot water"
"The company who made me redundant as a social media manager 7 years ago still haven't removed my access to any of their Twitter accounts. Sometimes I log in to change who they follow and like inappropriate tweets, but I'm not brave enough to post something."
"If you hear me spontaneously start humming or whistling, especially if it's not an actual tune but just random notes, it means that a random memory of something I did has popped into my head that is so embarrassing, awful, or disgusting that I'm trying to distract my brain."
"My wife said I seemed angry on our kids first birthday. I brushed it off, didn't want to tell her I was angry because it was a reminder we hadn't had sex in a year and nine months."
"I've grown a beard with the sole purpose of hoping that people will say oooh, you look much younger when I shave it off"
"Working from home - during regular zoom meetings with my boss... he constantly pulls on his long ear hairs. I want to tell him to stop, but I feel it would limit my career."
My wife usually goes to bed before me. She thinks I stay up watching porn and wanking. Most nights I'm actually playing Animal Crossing.
"Whenever I waste food, eat meat, get a new plastic bag or buy something I don't really need I always feel I need to apologise to George Monbiot in my head"
I'm an etsy seller and without exception I look up buyers addresses and judge their homes.
I draw out F1 circuits on my Mrs's nether regions when trying to get her in the mood.

When charities come to the door asking you to sign up to direct debits I tell them I'm not allowed a bank account that does direct debits. Complete lie. I just don't want to.
I'm a professional chef with around 15 years experience and I can't tear tinfoil off the roll in a straight line. Just simply can't do it.
"When I was a kid I put Baby Bio in my mums homemade soup when she didn't let me out to play. Instead of confessing, I sat and watched the whole family sit round the kitchen table and eat bowls of the stuff. No one noticed or was ill - thankfully 🤫"
"2 days before leaving my job, I put a load of fake meetings in my diary and fucked off to watch No Time to Die in peace without having to take the family. No regrets"
"The only thing I've ever stolen was a pen when I was a student. But I was so full of guilt I had to go back the next day to try to return it, and nearly got caught in the process. I am no master criminal. This pathetic memory still brings me shame most days."
I regularly chew blu tac instead of gum. It tastes like shit from the start so at least it's not trying to lure me in with some mint scented nonsense that fades away to taste like shite.
"I'm a security guard at an office building, I do the night shift so I get paid £12 an hour to sleep/play my nintendo switch in the control room. If anyone tried to rob the place I'd let them crack on, I'm not getting my head kicked in to stop them nicking a poxy computer."
Once a year I take a day of leave without telling my wife. I work at home and have breakfast as she is leaving the house. Once I have verified that her train has departed ok I drop acid. By the time she gets home I have come down enough to act semi-normal and eat my dinner.
Now I'm approaching 40 I'm actually glad my sex drive is cooling off a bit. It's like I've spent the last quarter century chained to a maniac.
On a 24 hr bender in Ibiza I got to Space with one pill left. Whilst fumbling around in the toilet trying to retrieve it a policeman appeared behind me causing me to drop it into the urinal bowl. I discretely picked it out and necked it. Wasn't going to let that go to waste.
My best friend died 6 years ago. I exported our huge WhatsApp chat to a file. My wife keeps asking what I'm laughing at on my phone. It's just rereading random bits and missing everything
"I tried to get my partner to use squirty cream during sex to spice things up, we both hate squirty cream so it had 1 blast on her nipple then went in the bin."
"In a relationship but addicted to Tinder. Just scroll for hours using my fake profile swiping, never talking to anyone."
In my early teens I had a 3 different paper rounds delivering the towns free paper. In the winter I could never be arsed so I would put all the papers in the bin. I got away with it for 2 years until someone complained they never got the paper in the winter months.
I worked in a cloakroom in a popular London music venue in my late teens. Had to deal with a lot of drunk letchy arseholes. If I thought you were a particular knob I would spit great big juicy wads of phlegm into your pockets. Sorry not sorry
Stayed at one of these posh converted barns on a farm . Sign in the kitchen said Please feel free to feed our pigs any scraps that you have after meals.
One morning I couldn't get through the bacon sandwiches that I'd cooked for breakfast. Still feel slightly bad to this day.
I'm 32 and still check the empty lockers when swimming to see if there's any left behind £1 coins
We keep keeping the lube out by mistake and now my kids think that it's Daddy's Bum Cream.Not sure how long we have till they work out what it really is.
I am the ultimate dad with the central heating: 19° max for 1 hour in the morning and 3 in the evening - except on my midweek day off when the family are all out. Then it's 23° all day.
In the office today and have been listening to Spotify on my Bluetooth headphones. They just disconnected and the phone was on full volume. Now the whole office heard I was listening to Phil Collins. I've have never felt so humiliated.
I left England 10 years ago and moved to a country with English as a second language. After not being able to get a job in my field I decided to try become a copywriter. I'm really shit at it but make almost £100k a year because everyone 'assumes' I'm good.
"I once fucked a taxi driver to get out of paying my fare home from Manchester Airport. The bastard gave me crabs, so I guess we're quits."
"When I get an itchy back and no-one's looking, I scratch it with a dinner fork, and put the fork back in the drawer."
"My friends had children who were uncontrollable little shits, I made sure they got the Hulk Smash! fist gloves with built-in smashing noises for Christmas."
"Stayed in a hotel in Vegas a few years ago. Took the extra pillows out of the wardrobe & a wallet fell out with a drivers licence & a thousand dollars. Binned the wallet & licence, bought an iPad. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose."
"Every lad of a certain age knocked one out in a pair of marigolds, after watching Band of Gold"
"I found a pricey abandoned second hand buggy, cleaned it up, and sold it on eBay for over £400. We didn't tell the buyer it was a trash buggy. Kerching."
"Our house has a pointlessly large hedge that separates driveways, we were planning on having it removed until our tosspot neighbour suggested having it dug up so he could fit a fourth car on his drive. It's still there, purposely left overgrown, 15 years later."
"Group assignment during 3rd year of uni. Got lumped with a lazy posh twat who offered to pay the group members £100 each to do his work because he just needed to pass. So naturally we took the money and omitted his name from the final project, he had to resit the year."
I can't orgasm when I have sex with my boyfriend of 3 years. Usually I just wait till he isn't in the house and watch videos of Tom Hardy to help get me off 😉
"Couldn't afford to get the broken bog fixed when I was a young penniless student so I spent a month shitting into Pringles tubes. If you worked in Waste Disposal for Dundee City Council circa 1995, I am terribly, profoundly sorry."
"I am banned by Twitter for calling Piers Morgan a rude word. The only way I can read Fesshole is by using incognito mode on Chrome. I live in fear that my teenage son, will look over my shoulder one day and think I am going incognito for the same reason he does."

I've three boys. None them know how to change a fuse never mind change a plug. I'm failing as a dad.
When I used to go out in the car with my dad when I was young I used to entertain myself by counting how many cars we overtook v how many overtook us . I still play the same game now when I drive . I'm 63
"I encouraged a friend to write a novel. He gave it to me to have a look at, and I told him I thought the main character was a total prick. Turns out it was autobiographical."
My wife makes wedding cakes. She's done some analysis of her profitability recently and it's tanked compared to previous years. She's put it down to the higher cost of ingredients but the truth is that now I work from home I gorge myself on the ingredients by the handful daily.
I'm grower not a shower so whenever I walk through full body scanners at airports I have a quick rub so I don't looks small
Every time I give directions to a stranger I will spend the next hour or two picturing them completely lost due to my useless instructions and cursing the day they ever asked me for help.
"Whenever I get an email to tell me I've won a prize on the lottery, I delay logging in to my account for as long as possible and dream of ways to divide up the millions to people and causes I love. However it's always a couple of quid and I never share it."
"As a teen, I was told that if you shagged a melon, it 'felt like the real thing'. It was rubbish. A carpet cleaning company came to clean the sticky melon juice off my bedroom carpet. I told my parents the dog had thrown up. Thanks for taking that one Ben."
I've bought a house and moved in with a rebound partner I don't find sexually attractive. I'm spending our first night in the house sat in the kitchen getting drunk hoping they fall asleep so I won't have to have sex with them.
"My girlfriend of 2 years recently started working in a brothel. She now brings home between £1k & 1.5k a week, for what is basically a part time job. Quite frankly it's amazing and she wishes she'd started years ago."
I always have a cheeky sneaky pork pie if I go to the supermarket by myself.
Ran out of loo roll today so used the kids' wet wipes. Dislodged some crusty winnets that must've been welded on there for decades
I only found out what wanking was at the age of 19 when I saw a porno for the first time. When I saw the man's white jizz I said aloud 'What in the hell is THAT?' I can't believe it took me so long to discover wanking. I missed out on my best teenage years.
"FROM ADMIN: I'm reading all your confessions and moderating again, this is a daily time suck for me, which I DO find fascinating but also, if you enjoy the work I put in, please buy a sausage https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"My housemate has a cat and is always complaining about her, despite the fact that she's very affectionate and adorable. He gets annoyed that she goes out at night and doesn't come back until morning, which isn't true; she's in bed with me, getting all the cuddles she deserves."
"Spent the last 15 months on furlough, didn't tell wife and used to drive to 'work' min-fri. Spent the day sat in the car playing clash of clans and eating crisps, best time of my life."
I'm a civil servant in my forties. I conduct most of my Teams meetings with a secret guinea pig on my lap. No one has ever asked what the occasional squeals are.

"I'm a guy in my early 40s and a couple of years ago I had a hearing test which showed I'm a little deaf and needed hearing aids. Thing is, I'm nowhere near as deaf as I make out, and I intentionally ignore the kids and wife on a regular basis when I can't be arsed to answer."
"Sleeping in the spare room whilst we're doing newborn night-time feeding shifts. I am loving having my own room. I've put up shelves, set up a sound system and I'm well on my way to recreating my teenage bedroom."
"I'm glad I don't go clubbing with my other half any more. He looked like an utter twat when he danced, like Michael Flatley with 20 Red Stripes in him. I didn't look much better tbh."
"When lockdown ended and the schools went back, i loved hearing the kids in the playground as normality was back - then felt a bit of a nonce"
"Someone I follow bangs on about her only son, what a good kid he is and how he cried at the recent vigils in London. She posted a picture of him the other day. He's my coke dealer. I nearly shit myself laughing."
As the only male in a house full of females I tend to use the shower gel called Femfresh as it doesn't smell as girly as the others in the bathroom. Turns out it is for washing vaginas.
"As a horny teenager in the 90s with limited access to porn, I went through a stage of wanking to a picture of a woman getting a mammogram in a biology text book."
When the lottery rollover gets really big I never ask my wife to contribute to our tickets so I've got the option to keep the whole thing if I want to reassess and leave her.
"Before the days of incognito browsing, at a mates house party I printed off multiple copies of his internet history and handed them round the party. At first he frantically tried to collect them all up, then accepted his fate and talked us through his favourites"
I've started stealing stuff from M&S when I use the self checkout. I've become much more aware of my white middle class privilege when I know I could talk my way out of the fact that I haven't paid for my truffle mayonnaise.
I was on a packed Tube train eating a croissant. A big flake fell on the shoulder of a man next to me. I considered dislodging it but just kept looking on. 5 minutes later he turned 90° & the flake landed on a woman's lap. She glared at him. He was unaware of the whole drama.
If I get a lot of likes on a tweet I have put up I look through the pictures on the accounts to see if any good looking ladies have liked it and hope for a moment that I could shag one of them but then remember I'm a ugly bastard and I have no chance
"I have had 15k paid into my bank account by some insurance company, not a clue what for. I'll say nowt, see how it pans out..."
"I'm terrified of trams. I don't understand why everyone isn't, and crucially why they're allowed. IT'S A TRAIN THAT DRIVES DOWN THE HIGH STREET IT'S MADNESS."
I was on tour with a theatre co in the 80's we had a gig in Amsterdam. Next day I drove the van to Düsseldorf & realised there was a massive piece of cannabis resin we'd bought on the dashboard. We pulled up at the customs checkpoint & I ate the whole thing - ill for 3 days
"My mates and I played football all the time as kids. Then, without knowing it, we once played together for the final time. I think about this often and it breaks my ageing heart that we've all grown up."

"For the sake of decency, I pretend to my girlfriend to have respect for her cat, but frankly he is a fuckwit."
I listen to stereo mixes of Phil Spector classics as I know he hated stereo. Fuck that guy.
18 years old I stumbled home pissed along Brighton seafront back to my Mum's house.
"Knocked over a Vespa parked on the road behind us which my bedroom window overlooked, mirrors smashed everywhere. Next AM I could hear shouting from outside so stayed in for the weekend"
"There's a bit in the Dr. Who spinoff K9 and Company where Elizabeth Sladen says Brendan, stop honking! that l find deeply seductive for some reason."
"I do a weekly pub quiz with some mates. One guy always did it just on his own, so we decided to invite him to join us. Turns out he's the most annoying bloke in the world and now we can't get rid of him"
"When withdrawing from a cash point it often says:  Take your cash and your card will follow I always sing Free your mind and the rest will follow as made famous by En Vogue in 1992. As some of you who remember the song will also do from now on, sorry."
"I went through a phase of whenever I was drunk walking home from the pub, I would remove peoples 'For Sale' signs and stick them up in a random garden down the road. It got to a point where I actively seeked them out in my area on rightmove."
"When i put my kid's sandwich for his lunchbox in a paper bag i give it a twirl to seal it up and say there you go treacle, anything else you like? in the manner of Pete Beale working the fruit stall at Walford Market"
"On my bus ride in the morning, I watch all the kids racing to ring the bell for the bus stop. I always press it first and watch their disappointed faces as their mums stop them from ringing it a second time. I'm 41."
"It doesn't bother me that my boyfriend has children from a previous marriage. But I can't lie, I'm disappointed by his choice of ex wife and the fact that her odious, obnoxious, manipulative, profoundly selfish, vengeful, spiteful ass is in our/my life"
"I steal chips from my daughters plate. Not in a jokey-dad kind of way, more in a greedy-want-her-chips kind of way."
Whenever I need some inspiration in life I watch the film Limitless. It usually gets me out of the rut as I find it really motivational. Or it might be because I just love drugs.
Told my kids years ago that parents have to pay to register baby names by the letter. Years later they still believe this is true and have begun to question why we went cheap on our daughter's much shorter first and middle names.
"Was very hungover in work a few weeks ago so went for a lay down in the disabled toilet but don't lock the door properly, someone came and saw me so I had to pretend I'd fainted"
When booking cinema tickets online I always select child tickets. They never check.
"Been hiding my smoking from my wife since we got together 8 years ago. I keep my suits at the office, send out for dry cleaning and use the shower at work before I leave. That's why I turned down a new job: they had no shower and no wardrobe for my smoking clothes."

"My husband has a mansplaining problem, every time he does it I hide his keys, bank card or similar, he's now convinced he's getting Alzheimer's"
I don't get on with my brother and I don't like his girlfriend. I secretly feel happy that his daughter is hideously cross-eyed.
"I am a fat, greedy cunt that orders 3 person Hello Fresh recipe boxes when it's only for me and the missus. And I still give myself more than half when I dish up."
"For 12 years I've convinced my wife that Croydon Airport is fully functioning, despite it closing in 1959. She's fallen for this despite never seeing a plane fly there, even whilst waiting for my covid tests in the hotel. She's sad when i say we have to fly from gatwick."
"Today I got a court order to remove a child. I'm a social worker, it's my job, it's the right thing to do. But I'm wracked with guilt, feeling like shit, wishing I'd never chosen this career. I'm so sorry."
"I grew up in care and never ate steak in my life. One day on a trip out, my friend's family said I could order anything so I ordered steak - the waiter came over, I ordered and he said 'well done?' I was genuinely baffled, so after a brief pause said 'Thank you.'"
"I was 12 when  I Want to Break Free was released by Queen. When I saw the video, I didn't release that the hot blond in the school uniform was actually the drummer. Every time I see Roger Taylor on TV, it reminds me that I cracked a few off to him. Cheers Roger."
Split us with my ex gf 5 years ago. Never got round to telling my hair dresser so every time I've had my hair cut since I've just acted like I'm still in the relationship and give him updates on what we've been up to. I think it's a bit weird.
"When I was 12 I rode home with a carrier bag on my handlebars, it got caught in the wheel & threw me off, scaring my face. I was that scared of my parents shouting, that I made up a story that a car hit me. My extended family felt so sorry for me and bought me a new bike."
"Got my guttering cleaned and the bloke only took cash. Looked the company up on Companies House to see what was going through the books - no record of it. Considered reporting, but given he did a good job at a reasonable price, I don't see how it's any different to Amazon."
"I shit the bed at a nice hotel after a curry and massive drinking session. It was a horrendous mess. I fessed up, bunged and the cleaner 200 quid to sort it out, and not tell my company who paid for the room."
"If my employer knew my Reddit handle, they would know I do a lot less work than I claim"
"I'm an accountant, proficient in Excel at a large, respected law firm. I still routinely Google the more than/less than symbol to make sure I've got the right one."
"I once referred to my boyfriends willy as Rod Stewart as a joke and now it's become a totally unironic, serious thing…sorry hun"
"Publicly I dislike U2 for the tax avoidance and general overblown rockist juggernaut aesthetic, but secretly I have a guilty pleasure of putting on 'Where The Streets Have No Name' or 'Pride - In The Name Of Love' full blast and temporarily getting into that stadium rock spirit."

I recently started a new job. It's the most senior position I've ever held and I'm paid more than I've ever been paid...but I'm also the least busy I've ever been. I largely sit and play guitar all day and occasionally reply to the odd email.

"I guess this makes me a bad parent, but my favourite sound is the satisfying rattle of a piece of Lego getting sucked up the vacuum."
"I once found a maggot in my wank sock aged 15. Bin your wank socks regularly, kids."
"Because I'm an indie kid from the 90s I can't stop myself thinking of DMs as Doctor Martens. As in, he slid into her DMs - wouldn't they be about three sizes to small?"
"I pride myself on generally being inclusive, but I have been coaxing my child to invite only the kids WITHOUT allergies to her birthday party. I just can't deal with the responsibility or financial burden of a kid with life or death dietary requirements."
"I love 'Tired of Being Alone' by Al Green. It's my favourite song ever, his voice and the trumpets are incredible. I listen to it every day and I'll never be bored of it. I never say it's my favourite song though, because my mate said it makes me sound lonely and desperate."
"Missing and worrying about my daughter who's gone off to uni, I cuddled one of her old teddy bears to help me sleep. Best night's sleep in years. So now I take a teddy to bed with me every night. Wife is furious."
"When I was 16, I got a summer holiday job sweeping up in a factory. When I got home I heard I'd been offered a better job, so I just didn't go back the next day. I felt a bit guilty, but felt even worse a few weeks later when they sent me the pay for the day I'd worked."
At uni I gradually dyed a friend's hands blue by mixing blue hair dye into his Carex hand wash.
Used to get paid by parents to pick up dog shit in our garden. Learnt the fastest way to do it was to whack it into the bushes with a stick. Vigorously hit a shit too hard one day and it landed on the glass conservatory roof where it lived for about 10 years until it decomposed.
"Aged 13, I attemped to copy Buffalo Bill's mangina from Silence of the Lambs in front of my bedroom mirror. I injured my right testicle. I was in agony for days. Told my parents I was hit by a football."
"I once managed a celebrity and got landed with a load of their fan mail. One of the letters contained a bar of Dairy Milk, which I scoffed and then failed to answer a single letter, ever. Sorry, kids!"
When I go into the spare room to escape my husband's snoring I'm secretly pleased that I get to cuddle the teddy bears. I'm 44.
"I've been on a diet and exercise plan for a while. Sometimes I fall off the wagon for a day. I pretend I'm Ricky Hatton, eating loads of junk before I get back to training. It makes me feel better about it."
I never shagged around and had one-night stands when I was younger and I really regret it. People tell me they're not all that but I'd like to have found that out for myself.
I once went to the wrong funeral in North London that unbeknownst to me was being held in Belgium. Only realised my mistake when I realised I didn't recognise the man in the open casket.
"If it comes up in conversation, I say I passed my driving test first time. The truth is that I have no idea what the number is. It was either 8, 9 or 10. I sometimes wonder how many of us who took it loads are out there."

I'm pretty famous - if you were alive in the 90s. Mask wearing is brilliant as I can now get across London without being stopped for photos as I'm no longer recognised. Long may masks continue.
"The person I've been dating has moved cities for work, I've never done distance before and panicked when she asked for pics and sent her one of my dinner"
"I used to work in a posh club bar. An obnoxious poshie threw a firework at me behind the bar. My clothes were badly burned. I was promised new ones on him, but didn't get them.The piss head never checked his account. Guess who kept me in drinks until I left years later?"
Top performer in the office lost his dad at the start of lockdown. I had to take over his work and found he'd been faking stats and hiding or deleting work he didn't want to do. I dropped him in it and he was sacked. Sorry about your dad but your lies made our work harder.
"On the motorway, I always find and follow a motorist that has a similar driving style to mine, like we're two Top Gun pilots on manoeuvres watching each other's six. When they exit, I always salute them and say You can be my wingman any time!"
My wife was against us moving to a quaint seaside town but I convinced her. Now we're living here and it just feels like half a town. 50% of the directions you go there's nothing but sea. Absolutely hate it to be honest but there's nothing I can do about it.
"I recently got promoted and I'm now allowed to have a PA. I hate it. I have practically nothing that I need her to do, so my main job has become finding her things to do. She must be so bored. Sorry Sarah."
"I cried in the cinema at the end of No Time To Die. The Mrs. is furious because I didn't cry on our wedding day, 2 months ago."
Everytime I'm at a friends house I go on their current Netflix/prime tv shows and skip a head a few episodes so they don't fully understand the story. I've done this for just over 3 years.
I put out food for the birds in our garden. I pretend I'm quite happy to benefit all birds equally but really I only want the pretty ones like robins and blue tits to get the food. Sparrows and starlings can fuck off.
"I joke with my work colleagues when I come into the office every day that I've had my vodka, so let's get started. I'm not joking"
"The night before leavers day me and a couple of friends broke in to the school grounds and drew a massive penis on the sports field out of grit salt. Unfortunately, it killed the grass and the image was still burned in to the grass for year 7 open day."
Ruined sex the other day because I remembered that Batman and Superman stopped fighting because their moms had the same name and that was such a ridiculous subplot that I started giggling uncontrollably.
I want to scream at my wife when she complains about putting weight on/can't lose it but sits there every night eating chocolate. I once suggested she cut back on the chocolate but she sulked. FFS. She's got two degrees so you'd think be able to work it out for herself.
"Even though I watched my daughter's being formed, I still hold the mistaken belief that belly buttons are created by the doctor tying a knot in the cord. The reality is just too manky to believe. "

"Growing up as a kid, I was once so mad at my sister that I peed on her bed and blamed it on the dog. Poor innocent Jessie got the slipper. The guilt still haunts me"
"In my early teens I decided to trim my eyebrows and made a dogs bollocks of one of them so decided to shave them all off and put elastoplasts on where they were, thinking no one would notice. Bad mistake every cunt noticed at school."
Sometimes when I go for a walk I end up following people for no reason. I like to think I'm an undercover MI5 agent tracking a suspect when in reality I'm just bored and going for a walk is the most exciting part of my day.
"As student stoners during the 2003 heatwave, my friend and I once drank all our water whilst walking to the smoke spot and subsequently resorted to using piss in our bong."
Shit myself walking home & rather than have the embarrassment of my wife seeing shitty underwear in the laundry basket I stuffed the offending article in a beer tin and threw it into a garden on my commute the next day. Always think about it every time I walk past said garden.
"The ads worked on me and I bought myself a SquattyPotty. And while yes, it does ease the passing of poop, it also leads to disturbingly long single piece poo-sausages that just shoot out of you. Bowl filling poo-beasts. It's a mixed bag. Greater bum-comfort, more mental horror"
Used to work for a large regulator and it was my job to process any complaint letters we received. Over lockdown there were too many for me to bother sorting out so I stuck them in the boot of my car and they remain there to this day
"I stopped making an effort with friends a few years ago after realising it was all one sided, just to see what happened. It still hurts on the odd time I see them that all they are polite but essentially indifferent. I thought I was a good friend but obviously not good enough."
"I used to work in a hotel. The wages were poor, the hours long and the manager an utter prick. For petty revenge one day I stole all the steak knives. Hell up. Sorry to anyone who ate a steak with a blunt knife at the Wellesley Hotel in Leeds circa 1985."
"In my first ever job as a paper boy, I used to supplement my poor income by occasionally pinching a can of Cossack hairspray which I dropped into my bag while sorting the papers for my round. Even in the most windy conditions my hair was perfectly groomed."
Managed to order all of my wife's birthday presents on my phone this morning in one 25 minute window while I took a giant curry shit. Very proud of myself and can't boast to anyone.
Aged 16 I appeared as an extra in a TV show. I got paid £60. I told my mum I spent it on tickets for gigs but in reality I spent it on the Best of Dolly Buster volumes 1 and 2! That was some great German porno.
My wife collects thin pieces of driftwood for an arty display in the bathroom. I've used at least five of these to chop up stubborn turds that refuse to flush.
"My ex boyfriend was huge downstairs! It hurt and was one of the reasons we are not together, but I think of him every time my husband doesn't touch the sides."
"Ah Jesus, I accidentally walked in on my mother in law taking a dump. I can't get the image or the smell out of my mind. It's even put me off having sex with my wife. I'm not sure I can ever forget that image."
Sometimes when I'm in a supermarket I can't quite believe I'm a grown up and can buy literally anything I want in the whole shop! It makes me giddy with excitement. I'm 38.

"If my wife has slightly annoyed me, I don't rinse the spoon after stirring my coffee before stirring her tea."
The first time the kids got nits from school I told my husband the whole family had to use the special nit shampoo. As he is bald I told him we had to use it on all hair. Now every time the kids get nits I get great pleasure watching him use the nit shampoo on his whole body.
"I'm in lump checking relationship with my housemate. I check her boobs, she checks my balls. We've no romantic feelings for each other but we're both very thorough."
My wife has just tested positive for covid. She is well and I am looking after her diligently. However her isolating upstairs is giving me joyous control over the tv for 10 whole days. Bliss.
"Every morning I look at what the daily increase is in Covid cases is. If it 's dropped, I don't know why, but I get pissed off. The inner me appears to want it to skyrocket."
"My ex husband hadn't changed his login details for BBC Online - I have spent the last few years logging in every week during Strictly and voting on his behalf, gives me great satisfaction a its the thing on tv he detests most"
"As a teen I worked in a newsagents, it was horrendous, the manager was a monster. I used to get my own back by giving all my friends 60 B&H for the price of 10 Sovereign."
"Now I'm in my 50s, it feels wrong to lust after the modern young pop stars. However, Kylie Minogue on Top of the Pops 1991 is still ok."
"Was on the way out last week, had some time to kill at a station in London so nipped out for a fag. As I jumped back indoors to head to the tube I must have missed my back pocket while slipping my tobacco in there. Whoever picked it up, enjoy the gram of gear in the filter box."
"As a teenager I was locked out of a party in a town 30 miles from home by the host and my pals who were off their tits. Had to sleep overnight in the garden. I can't decide if it was because I was a tosser or they were tossers. Either way, I find it crushing even 25 years later."
"I was bullied into being a keyholder for our office, despite living 25 miles away. Called out when the alarm went off at 2am, I took my German Shepherd Dog. I neglected to let her toilet first, and she did an enormous pee in a director's office. I didn't clean it up."
Workplace romances are the worst. All that stuff on TV about love in the photocopier room and side glances across the office is rubbish. In reality it's endless hours of awkwardness and all you end up talking about is work.
Browsing a supplier website for a small item I was surprised to see they had listed a Cisco switch with list price circa £10k for only 8 quid. Chanced my arm and 3 weeks later it arrived. That paid for a nice holiday.
My daughter came out. I'm cool with it but inside I was a little dissappointed. Not because I'm homophobic but this has ruined lesbian porn for me.
"Got my girlfriend to dress as Snow White for some sexy times. Despite how hot this was, couldn't get the 7 dwarves out of my head and was an absolute turn off."

"My neighbours were being cunts as usual, having a loud party. So I went outside and cut their broadband cable. Not sorry."
My school English teacher convinced me to take English at A level and I hated every second of it. Mr Bush if you're reading this; thanks a bunch.
"I was camping in a beautiful, quiet spot. Some bogans arrived, set up nearby, and were playing loud music and carrying on. At 3am I finally went to give them a piece of my mind, but they'd all fallen asleep, music still blasting....so I stole their portable speaker. Still got it."
As a teenager I picked a sizeable scab from my elbow and flicked it across the room. It landed in my mum's bolognese. She ate it.
I've convinced my 5 year old that QR codes are Santa's spy-cams. He goes quiet as a mouse every time he sees one.
I spend that much time arranging the dishwasher to fit in as much as possible that I'm now certain it would be quicker to just wash it in the sink.
My wife works away Mon-Fri. I love my weeknights alone. I say I miss her but love playing PlayStation and generally doing nothing so much I dread the weekend where I have to be a real person again
"After my first Zoom meeting after everyone had said their goodbyes I loudly proclaimed to myself Fuck that was boring. Although, of course, no-one including myself had logged out yet."
"As a feminist, I secretly hate the fact my male cat has dominance over my female cats. He gets all of the food he wants and snacks, they just let him. I love my female cats but my god I want to disown them for not being feminists too"
"In the pub in the early 2000s when phones had Bluetooth but not much security, I would send messages to nearby phones saying they had won a free drink and to show the message at the bar to claim."
"When I make carbonara, my partner complains I don't put enough bacon in. I do, but most of it goes on MY plate."
"When I was about 12, myself and a friend scooped up a carrier bag full of frogspawn from the local pond and posted it in the nearest post box. I feel bad for the postie and anyone who received frogspawn covered post in roughly 1989."
Until quite recently I thought local anaesthetic was an anaesthetic using local ingredients
"Many years ago I joined what I thought was the front of a queue at Clapham Junction Station. It turned out I had actually jumped a massive queue behind me. I was told that in fruity terms by those queuing, but denied I'd done anything wrong. Still feels me with horror."
Not very exciting but I've convinced my wife that all of my most delicious recipes involve a whole bottle of wine. It's always a single glass but I enjoy the rest while I cook.
"Whenever I visit London I take great pleasure in standing on the left half side of the escalator. Big rucksack on, earbuds in. Idiots need to slow down and I love making them. The glares I receive at the bottom bring me joy. Been doing it for at least 25 years."

"There's a woman who keeps challenging me to games on Words With Friends. We've played eleven times and I keep beating her comfortably. Like, an absolute thrashing. She's come back for more and now I just want to throw the game, give her some happiness then never play her again"
I wish I'd known before having children quite how much of parenthood would involve suppressing the urge to tell my kids to fuck off.
The worst thing about the children getting older is that it no longer seems to be socially acceptable for me to watch Sarah & Duck
I probably don't push the little stick far enough up my nose when I do a Covid test
I told colleagues I was late for a meeting due to heavy traffic. In reality I spent those fifteen minutes collecting conkers from the tree outside my house before the kids took them.
Bought a house with the girlfriend 6 months ago. We're both younger than 25. I'm finding it very stressful and have a secret stash of chocolate in my car that I eat in the car park at work every night. I'm worried this is a slippery slope to alcoholism.
"Once bought a suit from Next, had it altered, wore it to an awards do, then took it back for a refund. Somewhere a man is trying on a suit with 32 leg length that has been taken up to 28."
"One day when I was skiving off from school I got the curious thought about what it would feel like to fuck dirt. I went to a nearby forest, dug a hole and started to fuck it, I looked up and saw a dog walker staring at me in shock. I now live a normal life."
"When I was 15 my dad had a bottle of vodka on the kitchen shelf that he didn't touch for months. Over the next few weeks I would take a few sips before going out on the weekends, topping it up with water. He found out when his vodka orange was just diluted orange juice."
"If ever I'm going shopping in the city centre, I always read up on the latest news and events so that I will have an inciteful or witty response if I'm stopped and asked my opinion by the local TV news. Never have been."
"Father in law lived alone, died suddenly. His friend contacted me on Facebook saying FiL had asked him to remove some 'delicate' items from the house if he died. Took him an hour and 2 suitcases. RIP you massive pervert"
"For reasons i still don't understand 35 years later, i once balanced a cricket bat on the open first floor window ledge in our sixth form common room. The wind caught it, it fell, narrowly missing some first years. Even now, i still shudder to think what might have happened."
I have a massive crush on a younger work colleague- can't stop thinking about her. Won't do anything about it as I am married and not a dick - is this what a mid-life crisis is like? It's horrible
"I've given this some thought. It would be three days before anyone noticed I was missing, 8 or 10 before I was reported. I'm the ideal murder candidate."
"As a horny teenager I got amorous with a jar of crunchy peanut butter after warming it for 30 seconds in the microwave first. After shooting my load in it, I staged an accident by smashing it on the garden floor and throwing it away so my mum wouldn't be suspicious."
I bought one of them hospital piss bottles off amazon because I'm too fucking lazy to get out of bed and go to the bog for a piss in the night.

Before I go away for an overnight work trip my partner always blows me off. She says it's cos she loves me but I know it's because she knows I can't shoot twice in 24 hrs.. Reality is I love her and would never cheat but a BJ is a BJ..
Kids use my phone to bluetooth music to their hoverboards. Forgot my bluetooth was on and watching porn in the shed. Look towards house and see wife staring at me from window in horror as kids riding around home with porn blaring from hoverboard.
"Whilst waiting 90 minutes for my child to do his football training I search every number plate of cars that enter the car park to make sure they are taxed, MOT'd and insured. If I find one that isn't I get a little excited and proud whilst I report them."
The dog injured a bird in the back garden. It was obvious the wing was in bits. The bird was done for. I told the kids I'd bring it to the vet but in reality I hadn't the heart to wring it's neck. So I put it in a plastic bag and drove over it instead. Told them the vet fixed him
"In the early 2000's, I used to send naked photos of myself to a website called MobMMS. I had an absolutely huge following on there with well over a million views on my saucy pics. Gutted that I was born too early for Instagram or onlyfans. I could have been rich."
"I don't like tea but I drink it so I can say I'll do it after a cup of tea. At worst I get a 10 minute break. At best, they can't be bothered waiting and do it themselves."
"If I make a mistake typing and need to delete / correct a word, I try and keep the original letters if they can be reused in the replacement word - I want to give them a fair chance now they exist. Only fair."
Now I'm working from home due to the pandemic I occasionally ask my wife to do some scanning and printing for me. When she does I like to give her a kiss which sometimes leads to sex. Makes me feel I'm in an episode of Mad Men. Thanks Covid.
I am scared of static escalators. No amount of mental preparation can prevent my mind from telling me my body has been thrown forward as I step on. It's like when you think there's one more step at the bottom of the stairs.
Worked as a fruit picker in France on summer hol. The château had 1000s of bottles of wine for export in the barns. Many times as pick-up was being done I'd relabel some boxes with my home address. When I got home I sold hundreds of bottles of wine and funded most of my degree.
I told a girl at uni that my dad had a Ferrari in order to impress her enough to sleep with me. In reality he had a Toyota gt86. I printed out the Ferrari badge on crap A4 and taped it to the usual places on the chassis. It worked and I had the best sex of my life for 3 months.
I fancied a girl at school but she never noticed me. I used to imagine that I was in a coach crash with her &that I would save her by holding up the collapsing roof so she could escape but that I would then be crushed to death. That way she'd forever love me as her hero.
I once rang up my former CDT teacher from a payphone at 1am to tell him YOU GOT ALL YOUR ANGLES WRONG
"Despite constantly asking my three teenage boys to be more sociable and come down from their bedrooms to watch some TV with me and my wife, I'm always secretly pleased when they don't, as they just spoil it by constantly talking over the TV or arguing."
"On a caravan holiday when I was 16, I heard really loud Jean Michele Jarre music and thought I could have a wank and no one would hear. My mum awoke to the music and the van shaking. She talked about her out of body experience till she died"

"Without doubt, the most satisfying experience of my life was squeezing a blackhead I found on my knee when I was in my 20s. It was thick and was about 1cm long. I still think about it regularly."
Anything to declare at the airport - I've no idea what this includes. I've never looked it up. I'm 40.
When I was little I used to think it was compulsory to go on Blankety Blank as a contestant. I thought it was like jury service and I would lie awake at night worrying about being called up.
"Missus put me on a diet for our wedding next year. Makes me a salad every morning to eat whilst I work from home. Everyday I bin it, order Greggs and hide the evidence. She can't understand why I'm not losing any weight."
The natural shape form of my foreskin means that quite often my stream of wee is twisted. It's oddly fascinating to watch the flow of the stream whilst urinating.
"I played a lot of golf when I was 14. One day, I disguised pissing my pants on the 18th by 'falling' into a lake. Someone from the clubhouse saw, dragged me out and bought me a meal and some clothes from the club shop. Most lucrative piss ever."
"When I was 11 I stole The Book of Sex from the local library, proper Mission Impossible style by creating a diversion and everything. I'm an absolute wizard between the sheets now and put it all down to the intricate illustrations in that book."
I used an online translator to pass my German GCSE coursework. My teacher commented on how great my written language was and that it was at A level/fluent standard. I had to tell her I spent summers with my German grandparents that I never had
I used to watch Channel 5 films before English story writing exams. I'd copy these awful films completely and as no one ever watched them I could take the credit on the test. No teachers ever questioned them
"At work one morning someone had left a Brita filter soaking in a cup of water. I quickly stuck a note on it saying 'warm piss, do not touch'. Caused many complaints and an investigation."
I've a post grad degree and I've been on a million training courses - but my younger days spent playing Vampire LARP have been more useful than anything else in terms of getting on in the workplace and doing my job well.
"During Euro 2016, the lads had a sweepstake on which of the 1966 World Cup winners would be the last one alive. We've had lots losing in the past year, but I've made it to the final 3 and I'm massively confident. Hang in there George Cohen."
My wife has recently become addicted to viral video game 'Among Us'. To the point where she asks me to growl and call her 'my sussy Baka' during sex. Please help me.
"Stayed round a GF's parents house once and was scared to poo. Had stomach ache and had a bath. Farted in the bath and it didn't end well. Yes, I shit the bath in my GF's parents house"
Playing in local park when I was a kid I saw a portable barbecue and some camping chairs that looked like they had been abandoned. Took them home. Went back to park a little while later and saw a family looking for their picnic furniture.
My wife is always asking me what's wrong all the time. The truth is that I just want to be depressed in peace.

"I subscribe to mailing lists like Cartier, Harrods etc, not because I'm rich, actually, the opposite, it's because I'm poor and have been for years. In a weird way, reading the emails makes me feel better not worse."
I work in University admin and whenever an academic starts being an arse about their timetable I like to schedule their classes for the most awkward times and locations
"If I get a boner in the shower, I squirt shampoo on it like ketchup on a hotdog"
"Until I was roughly 25, I believed Rosetta Stone was a lady who was very good at teaching languages. I fully blame the Rosetta Stone TV ads in the 90's for this misinformation."
"Bought up Catholic. Now spend my life God free. No prayers, no mass. Substantially happier than before. However, at the back of my mind, I know that when I die God will abandon me as I have abandoned him and Old Nick is going to roast me over hot coals."
"The main school bully is now crippled with Parkinson's. We see him in his electric wheel chair, making the short journey to the shops. I jog past his living room window everytime I can, just to show him he lost and I won."
"My mum doesn't cook often, but when she does, she makes a big thing of it. She served up the worst curry I've ever had last night and I don't feel great today. But I've told her it was amazing so as not to hurt her feelings"
"My wife has a shopping problem. Every time she comes back from a store with more stuff, I take some of it and put it in my car. I return it for store credit. I have almost £2000 in gift cards. She never notices."
"What led up to this is a long story but I just told my husband that I loved our recently deceased dog more than his two young grandchildren. He said he wanted a divorce and stormed out. I don't think there'll be any coming back from this. The horrible thing is, it's true."
"I occasionally watch old episodes of family fortunes, bullseye & Bruce's price is right on TV & then try to find the contestants on Facebook to see what they look like now & what they've been up to since. I've found a few & one day hope to see they still talk about the appearance"
Someone on Twitter annoyed me so I found their address and arranged for a free secondhand sofa to be left on their driveway
Since WAH started in March 2020 I've kept a spreadsheet of the time I've spent wanking in work hours with a formula calculating it against my salary. So far I've earned £691.44 bashing out on work's dime.

"Started dating a nice guy. Few dinners, trips out etc. I dumped him after the first time we sept together. Sex was good but afterwards, he said I would prefer it if you had a full bush like my mum used to have."
"My cheap Amazon sunrise alarm clock plays a beautiful piano piece in a minor chord. Every morning, just before it goes off, my daughter comes in and asks me something ridiculous. As a single mum, I imagine this to be the intro to my own tragic-life, comedy of errors style sitcom."
"When me and my wife started trying for our first child, I'd already knocked one out downstairs before bed. I thought she was tired. Got upstairs and she's wearing the sexy outfit. I had to fake an orgasm. She said just think I could be pregnant now. Not that night she wasn't."
I have a van which has a no tools left in this van overnight sticker. Sometimes I leave tools in the van overnight.
Went to university in the 90s. Found someone's answers to the first weeks coursework saved on the c drive of one of the computers in the computer room. Stopped going to lectures and just searched all the c drives the night before each remaining 9 weekly assignment. Got 83%.
For years I thought the band INXS was pronounced Inks.
"When doing the whites wash, I always sing It's a nice day for the white washing in my head to the tune of White Wedding by Billy Idol. "
"I have no idea why I do this, as I'm not a fan of the song."
"When I make the children diluted orange, the amount of concentrate I put in depends on how much they've annoyed me that day. On a bad day, it is practically water."
I've lived with my partner for 7 years and we have 2 wonderful children together. Just lately I've noticed she says everyfink instead of everything. I now hear it everyday and correct her everytime. I feel a little part of our relationship dies everytime it happens
"One night I got so drunk I fell asleep on the toilet. Waking up I took my shoes off to creep into the bedroom so to not disturb my wife, and found myself standing in the public bar of my local with a shoe in each hand."
"I've flipped my boss's webcam so she's upside down. It's been 3 weeks now, she's not said anything, none of our colleagues have said anything. I don't understand my office dynamics anymore."
I really enjoy texting radio stations with messages for totally made up people. I think I like the power it gives me to be able to write a very brief script for a famous presenter. Still gives me a thrill every time I have one read out on air.
"Throughout lockdown, wfh I ate lunch at my desk from 12ish, then would tell my team I was going for lunch at 1. I had 2 hour lunch breaks every day for a year."
"Whenever I start a new book, I always read the very last sentence before properly starting the book. It feels more satisfying when you get to the end already knowing the outcome."
"I'll often start a domestic task, sit with it half finished and just chill for a bit or do something else, then leap into action if the wife walks in the room, so it looks like I've been doing it along. I've bought myself many hours of downtime over the years with this tactic."
"You know that thing when you see somebody in the street, recognise them and say hello only to realise later with embarrassment they served you in a shop? Did it the other day with a male porn actor. Think I should cut down on my consumption. Probably won't."

"My Dad moved abroad in '97. He left his credit card details with me to clear up his last remaining bills, and organise shipping of his remaining things. I did that, but also bought 2 tickets to Oasis and Verve at Earl's Court from an online seller at £400. He didn't notice"
"When I was a lad I would throw lit cigarettes in the holes the Gas Board had dug, in the hope of an explosion. Never did."
I like to wave at other random drivers in a jovial manner like i know them. I get a buzz knowing ive just confused them for the rest of the day.
"My mother passed away almost 20 years ago, aged 24. I am now 26. I feel myself growing increasingly guilty week by week that I have lived a longer life than she did, yet it is a very uninteresting and boring one."
"My sister, mother, stepfather and I have a group chat leaving my other brother out of it. We did so because he sends Daily Mail links and racist memes all day."
15 years ago I was part of a team the discovered a flaw in a poker site. Between us we 'won' over £2m. I chickened out at £4K. We all got away with it and I constantly regret not continuing for more.
"I've been a Vicar in a small, quintessentially English village for 16 years. I love the village fetes, chatting to people in the community and giving out advice whenever I'm asked. There's only 1 problem… I don't believe in God."
"Leaving the pub, drunk, one night, 15 years ago, I was attacked and left for dead. Guy was charged and I received compensation. I don't remember much, but I think I started it."
"I was 18 before I realised you could buy pigs in blankets all year round. Don't get me wrong I love them as a Christmas treat, ... but fuck me they're delicious at any time."
My wife thinks I'm more mature and responsible for getting Clubcard Plus to reduce our weekly shop cost. It's actually because it's £7.99 a month and my favourite Scotch is £10 off at the moment with the plus offer.
"I have a spider on my desk, making a web. I like the company. I wish I had a cat."
"I once got ghosted by a hook up that had left the house and was on his way. Fuming, I decided I'd sign him up for as many text updates, newsletters and general spam as I could. Spent 3 hours casually drinking wine and doing this. I still don't feel any remorse."
I'm a consultant in the Middle East on £250k a year tax free; tonight I declined an invite to go out for a posh dinner with colleagues telling them I had work to do. Actually I just wanted to sit in my hotel room and eat pot noodle like the cheap northern bastard that I am.
Looked up an old school bully. He's a heroin addict with a criminal record. Lots of trouble. Fuck him. Made my life a misery for years in high school. Made my day finding out.

"My ex-girlfriend, who I am still in love with, looked like Michael Bolton. Every time I hear one of his songs, I get an involuntarily erection."
I never tried recreational drugs or antidepressants in my life and never will because of the cartoon in which Stimpy put a helmet on Ren that forced Ren to be happy against his will until he desperately bashed it off his own head with a hammer. That shit was terrifying.
"Always thought I might be bi. After having 4/5 straight MMF threesomes with different couples, the sight of an erect penis really doesn't do it for me. Turns out I'm a straight guy who likes a bit of bi porn"
I'm so lazy. I lucked out with a workaholic business partner who's made me a millionaire. Everyone in the company knows I add fuck all but somehow he continues to work with me
When I go swimming I love to rub the dead skin off my toes. It is immensely satisfying. The other swimmers would be less keen if they knew.
My neighbour only owns 5 music albums and all of them are Elvis. They play them at full volume and have done for the many years I have lived next door. I now hate Elvis and can't listen to it. I am considering moving just to get away from it.
Instead of buying a PC game in a charity shop for £2 I snapped a photo of the code on the booklet inside and activated the code on Steam.
"I was so annoyed with my brother cheating during the stupid lockdown family quizzes, when it was my turn to host I set up a website with half the questions on it with the wrong answers - making the 1st so random it was the only search result on Google. Effort was worth it."
"A few months ago I was sitting down watching tv and my partner came up behind me, lifted her top and rested her really warm tits on my shoulders with my head between. Like two big hot cushions. It's a weird thrill for both of us, and we feel we've discovered something secret"
"I am a self-made multi-millionaire but when I make me and my wife a cup of tea, I only use 1 tea bag between the 2 and squeeze the living shit out of the bag getting every last drop."
"I'm a married man with kids. I read the mumsnet relationship pages to see what awful behaviour other blokes are up to. I like to use it as a check for my own behaviour to make sure I'm not an arsehole. Fellas, it turns out there are A LOT of arseholes out there. Sort it out."
I regularly steal weed off my teenage son when I'm cleaning out his room. He thinks he's keeping it hidden and would get in trouble if I found out he smokes.
I snipped a huge chunk of hair off my little brothers head when I was a kid. I was so terrified of getting a bollocking from my parents that I stuck the scissors in his hands and screamed Look what Charlie's done! I'm 45 now and they still think he did it.
"I take obsessive delight in removing tracking code from urls that I value enough to share. Anything to the right of and including the question mark, does the trick."

"As a small child in the 80s I received praise for my ability to move like a robot, I displayed my skills at every opportunity and I remembered how proud I felt many years after. It wasn't until I had kids that I realised adults were just humouring me, wankers."
"I'm married with 2 young-ish kids. When my wife and I have an argument and she talks about leaving me I can only imagine that it would be fantastic. Loads of time to myself, the return of a decent social life, and better quality time with the kids when I do see them."
I often put my destination into Sat Nav even though I fully well know the route there. Simply to try and beat the estimated time of arrival it predicts.
"Bought some sex toys to reignite the flame in the bedroom. Shaved off all my public hair, things are going well apart from my cock looks like ALF"
Years ago when I was at school combination bike locks were getting popular & some of us worked out how to open them without knowing the numbers. Saw a bike locked up with one and I stole the lock but left the bike.
When younger and thinner I thought I was overweight so joined weight watchers. The weeks I lost the most weight were the weeks I took Es when clubbing at the weekend.
"I know you'll never publish this but I have to tell someone: I'm in my 40s, married for 15 years and just had the best sex of my life. It's rarely incredible, it's no longer often, but it's great that there could still amazing times ahead for us in Shag City!"
I used to suffer from road rage. Pathetically aggressive hand gestures and shouting from the safety of my locked vehicle.Now I simply note the reg number and comment on their driving on a rate this registration website. Helps me be much calmer in the moment.
"My wife is a terrible dancer. She gallops around and does a weird rock the baby thing. I love her endlessly and would never tell her or anyone else I feel this way, but I just had to say it once not in my head."
I've been in my job nearly 3 months now and still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. My boss is the CEO and keeps saying what a great job I'm doing and how well things are going but in truth I spend the majority of my day playing football manager and wiggling my mouse.
when texting started I thought lol was a word art of a person doing a mexican wave celebration
"A friend has a balloon fetish thing going on. Most times I drop by, he disappears to his office and comes back with a balloon for my kid. The penny dropped when I saw a look his partner gave him. Fair play to them but sometimes, I don't know what to do with the fact that I know."
I encouraged my husband to join twitter thinking we would have more talking points. Now he just constantly scolls though us phone and I think of ways to kill him.

"As a young, eager Labour Party member some years back I attended a meeting with a senior figure from Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. Suggested we needed to be clear on election pledges and write our message in stone. May have accidentally inspired the whole 'Ed stone' debacle."
"A pub on my commute has an old wooden drop door, every morning I stamp as hard as I can on it partly hoping to cave it in and sue them but mostly just so I can avoid work for one blessed day."

"I made the mistake, five years ago, of telling my wife I found ironing relaxing when I was stressed. Now it's my thing and she leaves it for me to do no matter how much I complain. I got a fucking iron for my birthday last year."
I went back to a woman's place for a one night stand half way through when I was getting in my stride I look behind me and saw she had a full size Michael Barrymore cut out. Soon as I saw it I lost all drive as all I can think was Michael was judging me and I felt bad so I left.
"I'm dreading when my mum dies.Not because I'll miss her, but because I know I'll have to speak at her funeral and I can't think of anything positive to say about the old cow."
"My wife is great with our kids, generally ok to live with, more sex would be good. But the reason we shall divorce is because her parents always come on holiday with us, no escape, no fun"

When I was a teenager I booted a hedgehog as hard as I could except it turned out that it was a big pile of dog shit and not a hedgehog. It was dark.

"When I really hate something my partner wears, I intentionally stain it so he won't wear it in public. He's always dribbling food anyway so he doesn't suspect me."
Got my ballet class doing Nazi salutes when I was 6. Had no idea they were the bad guys just knew that it wound up the grown ups and that was funny.
I own a collection of roaches from spliffs I smoked with various members of Goldie Lookin' Chain at the height of their fame. I have no idea why.
"Nothing scratches my itching bollocks better than my wife's hairbrush.I started off using it to scratch my back, but it's now the answer to all of my itches."
"I crashed my car - nobody was hurt - into a parked car last year, causing some damage requiring our insurance companies to pay out. I said a child ran out into the road and I swerved to avoid her, but the truth was I was reaching for a Pringle and my hand got stuck in the tube."
I can only have sex with my husband before dinner. The way he uses a knife and fork disgusts me that much I have to avoid it. It's a pattern now thankfully
I often amuse myself by writing fuck the Queen in UV pen on banknotes.
"When ever i drive past the house i lost my virginity in, i salute regardless of who's in the car with me."

Six months into my relationship I kicked a can of light blue emulsion paint over a red carpet in our rental house. Three days to get it out. 38 years on and I've never been asked to decorate again. Kick those cans boys.
"Whenever move tufts of grass from my path to cracked bits of lawn, I imagine I'm doing Sir Elton John's hair transplants."
"When using Alexa, I always make sure to say please & thank you after every command as I'm convinced that when the robots take over they will consider, judge & ultimately decide our fate based upon how well we treated their ancestors"
I was 14. I put chewing gum in a lads coat I didn't like cos he was a dork. Saw him in the playground in tears later that day. I was a bully coward and I've regretted that day for 25 years. Never considered he couldn't afford a new one.
I gain enormous satisfaction from deliberately and subtly antagonising customers who complain about nothing to the point that they become verbally abusive. And then ban them for life.
A plasterer did a terrible job of our new wall. Refused to come and put it right after he'd been paid in cash. So he spent the next 6 months travelling to quote for non-existent jobs all over the Home Counties. And I dobbed him in to HMRC.
"As a student I worked for a summer in a strawberry canning factory in Germany. The supervisor was a complete dick. On our last day there, my friends and I all canned our socks. Sorry if you opened one of these in the 90s."
When my little brother & I were to have our own bedrooms I convinced him there was a spiders nest in the much bigger bedroom — which led to it being my room for the next 12 years
When I am using the squeegee to wipe my glass cubicle door after showering it always makes me think of Bruce Forsyth because of a Generation Game task in the 1970s when the families had to try to clean windows without causing streaks
"I believe Michael Jackson songs should be blacklisted by all broadcasters, however I sometimes treat myself to a blast of Billie Jean when I'm on my own. It's OK though because I illegally downloaded the MP3 years ago so it didn't help fund child abuse."
"My primary school was chosen to be in Joseph at the West end, but I wasn't picked to be part of the chorus. Now I sing all over Europe regularly of often think what any of my former class mates went to go on to do musically? Piss all I bet."
There's a small crack between the floorboards in my living room. If future residents ever renovate they will discover 5+ years of toenail clippings down there
"I'm a double bass player and more often than not, the next morning after drinking a bit too much the night before on a gig, I wake up in a panic that I've left it somewhere and have to check it's there. One day it it's going to happen I'm sure."
I think I'm cool but in reality I'm sat here pissed up on red wine on the sofa in a YouTube wormhole watching Carly Simon singing Your so Vain on a cruise boat
"I take items off the shelves in my local supermarket and put them in the food bank collection basket by the tills. Fuck 'em, trying to profit from people buying food to donate"
"At a work function, talking to a colleague, I took a sip of wine. As I turned back to her, a tickle in my throat caused an involuntary cough, like a sneeze, spraying her face, blouse and the bloke sitting beside her with so much red wine. Her incredulous face still haunts me"

I like to pretend my cock is a snooker cue and every time I make entry I'm actually playing a very tricky snooker or even a down table safety shot. Occasionally I pretend to chalk the tip and as I blow my load I imagine cannoning a couple of reds to knock one in a corner pocket
"Living on my own, I sometimes piss in my laundry basket as I can't be bothered climbing 2 flights of stairs to the toilet. I need to get out of this habit as I'm having to do more wash loads and my room is starting to smell. But it's like a weird guilty pleasure"
"Aged 14 I decided to try sticking something up my bum whilst wanking, grabbed a long thin candle. Wiped it clean and put it back, but smelt awful when burnt."
"Whenever I go for a swim I never shower afterwards as a treat for my cat. She loves chlorine and will lick me all over when I return home, she does this incredibly thoroughly."
"Whilst teaching my son how to skim stones a duck took a direct hit from a stone I threw. Me, my son and 10 other people watched on as the duck flapped, kinda barked, face planted into the water and slowly drowned. We've not been back since."
"Had a medical for a job. Mates told me I'd have to drop my pants & cough while the doc held my balls. During the medical, doc said now I need to check for hernias. So, I dropped my pants, everything on show. Turns out he only needed to check my stomach. Mortified."
"Love you dearly, but in the event of your death I know exactly what pieces of your household tat i'm throwing away. It's most of it."
I've had multiple affairs with married men. At the time I thought 'hot sex for me + satisfied husbands = treating wives better' as some sort of justification to stave off guilt. Now I'm getting married and fully expecting karma to bite me in the ass.
"I'm extremely good at job interviews, but don't put half as much effort into the job once I'm there. As this becomes clear quickly, I move every 18 months, for more money each time."
"My teacher always told me 'you won't get a job staring out the window all day', I work as a tube driver now on 68k a year and literally stare out the window all day"
The best food/take away recommendations I've gotten was from escorts I've visited. Now everytime I ask them where do they go for food
"I just had to get out of the bath after what I thought would be a brief, one-second mini-piss turned out be more of a 10-seconder."
"To convince myself I wasn't that fat I started counting every man I saw in public who looked fatter than me & kept counting all year, resetting every 1st Jan. The number of fatties gets a LOT lower each year. I still tell myself I'm not THAT fat even though I'm clearly a porker."
"I drive for Parcelforce, we can spot a Love Honey package a mile off, no matter how discreet they want to be. Nobody cares though. Who doesn't love a good wank?"
"At work I really enjoying holding the door open for people who are quite far away from the door, so they have to do this awkward run or fast walk towards you."
"Sat on a Zoom call with my team, I have mastered the art of silently letting rip with creative use of the mute button. Unfortunately on my last attempt I full sharted and had to sit stewing in my own bowel movements for a full half hour until my presentation had finished."

"To test a theory, I mentioned to a payroll team member that I'd just been bitten by a small fly I'd seen coming out of a plant pot. Within 2 days nearly every team member was suffering from bites and rashes and all plants were removed from the office. There was no fly"
I love it when it's my partner's birthday or Christmas approaching. I can order anything I like without it getting checked so it won't spoil the surprise. Never seems to figure out that ten parcels only became five presents.
"When I was under the booze, I'd mask the sound of late night drinking by opening a can of beer behind a sofa cushion. Over the months that followed, the wetness festered into a god awful smell. As our cat was spraying around the house at the time, I blamed it on her."
Old Geography teacher died a few weeks ago. Found his Twitter where he had an obsession with the pornstar Hazel Moore. Had a wank in his honour watching one of her films recently.

"Remote working got a lot of compliments recently about my newfound enthusiasm for my work and my co-workers. Told them I discovered yoga. Actually, I discovered micro dosing MDMA. Makes my shit job and asshole colleagues bearable."
"Every September 1st, I wait for my hogwarts acceptance letter. I'm now 31 and not eligible but the dream is still so vividly real."
Don't want to go back to the office as have put on and 5 stone and used to take the piss out of a colleague I've seen has gone from huge to completely buff in the last year
I've recently realised I make the same small vocal tics when I look at the menu of pornhub as I do looking through the wine aisle at Waitrose.
I believe I'm the British record holder for the highest wank on land. This was achieved at the top of Ben Nevis around 2005. I regret shooting my load into my pants rather than onto summit so I'm unsure if Guinness world records will recognise my achievement.
"Blind man stops me in the park asking for directions to get out. I panic & point. & point. & point. Then physically manhandle him so HE'S pointing in the right direction. Then, like a wind up toy I just let him go. I still have nightmares about it. Why didn't I just walk him out?"
"When I was 15, I entered an art competition to to win a mountain bike. I cheated and entered my work into the 9-10 yr category instead. I won and they sent me the bike. It was fucking tiny!"
In my first year of uni one of my flat mates bought a new Xbox and loved playing gears of war on it. Every time I knew he was playing online I used to flick the fuse box for the flat for no reason than to ruin his evening.
When I was 8 I was so excited to be playing a game at a demo booth in a videogame store that I wet myself while playing it. On subsequent trips to the store i could see a stain on the floor where I had stood.

"I work in recruitment, though have my job title on car insurance down as 'receptionist' as it saves me £400 a year on car insurance. I think of it as a truly victimless crime."

"My work colleague really pissed me off, so when they went for lunch I hid a security tag in the lining of their bag. I hope that fucking alarm goes off every fucking time they're in Asda."
So it turns out don't want to make a rod for my back and don't want to make the beast with two backs are quite different sayings and I've been using the wrong one for a while.
"As a man in my 40s, I've always suffered with oily, shiny skin- mixed with sweat it ended up being like a waterfall and very noticeable. Recently discovering that using a roll on deodorant across my forehead stops it completely has really boosted my confidence."
"Whilst walking my dog I hadn't notice he'd stopped behind me whilst walking over a bridge, cocked his leg up the railing and took an almighty piss right off the side onto the traffic below. It hit a motorcyclist who was rightly fuming. We legged it. Sorry."
Around the age of 8 I wondered what a bum hole looked like and convinced another girl in my class to show me hers. Fast forward 40 years and she's recently got in touch on Facebook and wants to meet up. I'm now scared she's ask me why I did it and I dunno.
In every hotel I stay in I write 'with love from God xx' in the bedside table bible.
"As a kid I was heavily into Thomas and Friends, I thought Henry was a girl so when I played with my toys Henry and Gordon were a couple. When my mum was pregnant with my sister she told us it was a girl so I asked can we name her Henry. She wasn't named Henry I was disappointed."
"I have told my wife that when we get old and I start keeping a tissue or hanky up my cardigan sleeve, she is allowed to kill me without any consequences to her. Hankies up sleeves is gross. I do not want to associate myself with it."
I am a life long Thrash Metal fan but recently my 3 year old daughter's disney viewing has resulted in a playlist including absolute hunchbacked banger The Bells of Notre Dame which is sang at suitable dramatic volume most days with exaggerated actions and theatrics.
"Husband is exceptionally hairy. He once shaved off his pubes thinking it would be 'sexier'. Ended up looking like Bigfoot wearing y-fronts made of skin with his dick hanging out. He sticks to just trimming now, but the damage is done and I can't unsee it."
Whenever I go for a poo I take off my trousers and pants so I can open my legs further apart and get additional hole spreaddage. It's comfier on the way out and leaves less to wipe up.
In primary school there was a deaf girl in my class. My best friend and I used to take it in turns to silently scream in her direction. Prompting her to tell us to shut up! I still feel terrible about this. 40 years later.
I'm 411. Can't wait til I get grey hair so people stop talking to me like I'm a child.
Staying with my partners family for a few days and they're all obsessed with this weird bean based card game that makes no sense. Hid the game under the bed at the first opportunity to get out of playing it.
"Instead of tweeting my political comments and views I now just submit them to @anon_opin. Gets it out of my system while avoiding having to engage with appalling people's appalling views, and no one gets angry because they never publish them."
My wife didn't tell me or discuss that she'd stopped taking the pill. I only found out when she dropped a pack of folic acid tablets and by then she was already pregnant. Still annoyed now.

"The day my mum sadly pops her clogs, I'm going straight round her flat to bin the 1970s vibrator I accidentally stumbled across when looking for a hairdryer a couple of years ago. Good luck to her - and all that - but no-one needs to see that."
"This is a really boring and mundane one, but I feel as though lockdown and continually working from home has drastically made my speaking skills worse. When I speak to a colleague or a friend I find myself stuttering through my sentences and it is really getting me down."
To avoid doing a drama exercise about emotion memory I lied and said I was allergic to chocolate which was part of the task. It's now 30 years later and the lie has followed me. I buy a bar and eat it secretly in my car as my family still all think I'll die if I eat it.
I regularly have to ask for people's address at work to get things delivered now we're all WFH. You bet your spotty arse I'm judging everyone's house on streetview.
My toddler was being a little shit all morning so to see her burst in to tears at the surprise of the toast popping out the toaster was bloody glorious.
"Sometimes I eat a bit too much at dinner, particularly if we're having a takeaway. Not only because I love food, but because it gives me an excuse to have some Rennie afterwards. Bloody love the things, the orange ones are gorgeous."
I'm 50 and still don't know how a rotary pencil sharpener works. They fascinate me. How does it know when to stop? I could ask Google but that would destroy the mystery.
"Whenever I receive any kind of unwanted adverts on Facebook, Twitter etc, I report them as, sexually inappropriate. Not sure it makes any difference but makes me feel better. Their fucking problem."
"During my first job as a waiter in a local hotel, if I had a snobby guest, I would deliberately stand a little back from the table while silver serving and dribble source over their legs. Soz."
I once got a payday loan for a bisexual orgy with 2 female escorts and a male escort on holiday in Spain. We fucked for hours. I got a mild STD from it - easily treated with a few pills - but was the best night of my life and I don't regret a thing. I got married four weeks la...
"When commuting on public transport, I like to check people out from head to toe, and to pick 3 items of their clothing or accessories for my imaginary walk-in closet."
About 10 years ago I did a shit so big that it coiled under the water and then stood free like an obelisk. My proudest achievement and I can't tell anyone.
"When I was about 12 I would go into a library and rip the last page out of as many books as possible , thinking back and now realising what a cuntish thing to do"
I used to play 5 a side football once a week which meant a night in the pub after. We've stopped playing about 3 months ago but haven't told my girlfriend we stopped. I just turn up to the pub in my football kit every week.
"My girlfriend is pregnant and I absolutely love her to bits, but I have no idea what I need to do at all and I'm freaking the fuck out."
Recently had an audition for a band whose music I don't rate. They had another guitarist audition 5 mins before me who they seemed really happy with - like they didn't care about what I played. Hurt my ego. So I smashed the audition and now I'm in a boomer band that sucks.

"As a teen I stole money from everyone. Parents, grandparents, visitors to the house - just £1 or £2 at a time from wallets/bags left in the hallway. I was not poor, hungry or on drugs - quite middle class and boring - but I had, and still have, a fucking great record collect..."
"Over the summer I got into work and walked into the MD's office, without thinking, I asked him How'd you find such a fit receptionist on short notice?It was his 20 yr old daughter on her break from uni."
"I drive for a living. I pick my nose a lot. I put snots on the steering wheel and let them harden in the heat. They go really chewy, and save me a fortune on chewing gum."
"I had not had sex during lockdown for over a year. On my first date with my new boyfriend, I had an orgasm just from him sucking my nipples. I felt like a freak so didn't tell him."
"When I was a 9 year old kid and Sexual Healing by Marvin Gaye came on the radio, I always thought, particularly the opening line Baby, I can't hold it much longer, the song was about desperately needing the toilet and trying to hold in a poo."
Sometimes I can hear my neighbours having sex so I put my bluetooth speaker against the wall and play Andy Gray's commentary on Gerrards goal vs Olympiakos at full volume. OHHHH YOU BEAUTAAAAY WHAT A HIT SON WHAT A HIT. I'm a big fan of motivating others.
"I once told a cashier that she couldn't sell the last copy of Modern Warfare 2 to a kid because it was an 18-rated game, then bought it for myself. I can still remember her look of disgust, then the kid started crying."
My partner and I have a well-off friend who's 82 and in poor health. She's often a right pain but we stay friends with her because she's got no children and she hates her brother. We know she's made a will and we're hoping she might leave us some dosh as well as her two dogs
"I take the dog out for a walk, just so I can play Pokemon Go, I hide my phone when I pass anyone so they don't know what I'm up to. I'm 37."
"My girlfriend refuses to drink whole milk in her tea but I hate skimmed and do the shopping, so for the last 2 and a bit years I've been rinsing out and refilling the same red top carton with whole milk without her knowing."
"We use the same towels to clean up after sex that we dry our kids with after their baths. They are washed in between those occasions, but I still feel guilty every time the pink elephant towel is wiping cum off my tits."
FROM ADMIN: Reading all your confessions again to prepared the posts for tomorrow. I find it interesting and enjoy doing it but it does take a stupid amount of my time. If you fancy bunging us a sausage (it's just paypal really) it's appreciated. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I
"I've noticed my penis has shrunk about half an inch during the pandemic and I can't ask a mate as they'll inevitably find it hilarious and take the piss. Not sure whether it's depression-related, being 45, long-COVID or all of the above. Shittin' it."
"We received the new CDs where I worked at Woolies on a Friday, but they weren't allowed to be sold until Monday. So I would always steal a few copies to sell to friends early for a few pounds extra, and then go in on Monday and 'buy' however many I'd 'stolen' to balance the stock"
"About 35 years ago, I thought I was imagining knocking on the wall from next door each time I went up or down the stairs. Being young & hungover it was easier to ignore it until it stopped - When my folks returned from holiday, they went to check on my now dead elderly neighbour."
We didn't come from money but my wife and I now have good salaries. We would be considered well off by most people. Living up to this middle class aspirational lifestyle is so shit and expensive that I often wish I was still poor so I didn't have to spend 2 grand on crap art

"T'was I who shoved chicken wings down the pool table pockets in The Farcroft pub. The barman was a rude wanker, and the wings were the worst part of the large mixed grill platter."
"I am finally going back to working in the office in a couple of weeks. Tried on my suits, trousers etc. Only thing that still fits are my shoes. Fuck."
"I'm a session musician and I often go into music shops and 'try out' the guitars, but I really just like to show off in front of everyone for an hour or 2 shredding on guitars I'll never buy or can afford."
When I'm eating by myself I will always lick the plate.
Used to love cooking with coconut oil but last lover was circumcised with a tiny cock and used a lot of coconut oil to lubricate. Now every time I smell it I remember his small penis and can't bear the smell.
I once tried to iron a shirt I was still wearing. I went on to get a first class degree from Oxford University.
"Sometimes I get envious of celebrities on their birthdays. Some of them get hundreds, possibly thousands of happy birthdays from strangers all over the world. No one even notices my birthday."
I am 40 year old but only use kids toothpaste. It does the same thing but tastes of strawberry sweets.
"I'm a new car salesman. A bloke around late 40s came in looking for a new sporty soft top. When it came to registering it, I chose as the last 3 letters 'MLC' from a list we could choose from. By the time he realises it stands for 'Mid Life Crisis' it'll be too late 😏"
"Years ago I told my partner I used to work for GCHQ, and it caused me to travel ALOT. I used to set up basic IT stuff, plug in a cable etc and she refuses to believe I wasn't some spy, no matter what I tell her."
"Hated cats all my life. Recently remarried, and she has two cats. I adore those little unpredictable fickle bastards, just love them. I now follow 100s of cats on Instagram and regret being so anti-cat for so long."
I pluck my boyfriend's back hairs while he sleeps. I don't think it's that weird--the weird part is that I sometimes eat them.
I'm an actor and was once in an ad for Apple. They flew me international business class to LA and paid me $20K plus $20K for a confidentiality agreement. They used half a second of my chin in the ad.
"I like to occasionally change the location on my Twitter profile to rude-sounding place names. You'd be surprised how many are on there. Nobody looks at my page to notice, but it still brings me a little joy."
"I work on a radio show with an address for listener emails. So many people give our email address at the till, sign us up for random shit, etc. spamming our inbox. We can't complain about it publicly of course, that'd only encourage the fuckers, but I hope they all die alone."
Used to run a Starbucks in the early 00's. Used to not ring through orders and count it in my head.. cash up the till at the end of the shift and balance it all out. Brothel on the way home 2 or 3 times a week and spend the rest on Coke. Used to train other stores on staff theft.

"I regularly used to take the Euro Shuttle with my car for work. I always kept old boarding tags so that if my boarding letter was some time off I'd switch it for an old tag with the next letter to board and get an earlier train, saving myself hours of waiting. Worked every time."
My son had a vomiting bug and threw up over the carpet in his bedroom. I put our Labrador in there and shut the door. When I let him out the room was sparkly clean.
After taking part in a charity fund raising eating completion I got a taste for baby food. My work packed lunch now regularly includes a jar which I eat whilst locked on a toilet cubicle.
I didn't realise you needed additional ingredients with the Old El Passo fajita kits so just ate the fajitas with the spice mix and relish.
My wife and I are part of an exclusive countrywide adult party community - with an app and everything - but we have to keep making up lies to our parents so they mind our kids whilst we 'visit friends' down south. Eventually they'll catch us but for now we feel a bit bad
"Friend of a friend used to work as a train ticket man in north west England. After he left his job, he kept his ticket machine and no one followed up. I have subsequently saved thousands on rail travel to London thanks to his home printed tickets."
"Whilst attending a wedding and unseen by other guests, I accidentally spilled a jug of water over the incredibly expensive centerpiece cake. I wiped it down as best I could with napkins and kept my silence when other guests remarked on how moist the cake was"
I pretended we had lost our wheelie bin and ordered a replacement so now we have 2 bins even though we're only allowed one. The 2nd one has a fictional house number painted on it and I leave it down the road a little bit so they don't suspect.
While working at a particularly argumentative client's home I had occasion to use their toilet. In which they had a copy of little Tommy Robinson's guide to being a racist prick book by the bath. I took the liberty of pissing all over it before leaving.
"I'm a window cleaner and one day, thinking my customers were out, I had a shit behind their pampas grass. They arrived home suddenly, their dog came running into the garden and ate my turd. It then ran back to the owner and started licking the owner's face."
I found out that a former co-worker started a YouTube channel. I drop a dislike on every video they upload.
Recently I've cut my excessive drinking down to the level that I've been pretending to be drinking for years. I feel amazing but I can't tell anyone why. Except Fesshole.
"I was asked to judge a beautiful baby competition, the first prize was £50 M&S voucher. I chose the ugliest baby to piss off absolutely everyone but the winner."
I'm about half as good a dad as I thought I'd be.
"As a kid I shat on a paper plate, sprinkled it with hundreds and thousands, stuck a wooden fork in it and left the masterpiece on a table in the local pub's beer garden."
I've ostracised a friend and cut him out of social gatherings because he refuses to accept Lauren Laverne is a great host of Desert Island Discs. I stand by this.

I used to airdrop photos of dead insects to random strangers. I met my wife on the bus home from work through this. She was sitting next to me and saw what I was doing and took the phone from me.
"Since getting Covid, losing, then regaining my smell, I can no longer smell 'bad' smells. Haven't been able to smell my own farts in 3 weeks now. This is devastating.. On a lesser note, I almost burnt down the house as couldn't smell a small fire in the kitchen."
I haven't done my job since lockdown in early 2020. Literally haven't done any work since then. No one has noticed. I recently got a large raise. I can't believe I'm getting away with this.
Shit myself on a date once. Carried out an emergency clean up operation in the toilet using my sock. Awkward moment later at hers when she wanted to know why I was commando and only wearing one sock. Married her - still have to wear one sock to the pub. Because that's my thing...
For 20 years I have stealthily been reducing the amount of milk I put in my wife's tea. Another 5 or so and she will be acclimatised to the correct standard and hopefully be able to make a decent cup herself.
"I had a gambling addiction in the past. I could not get enough of slots. To get over this, I now watch people winning on slots on YouTube. It's therapeutic and helps satisfy my wants. But, I get worried if loved ones see me watching these videos they'll think I've started again."
"When I was 12, I was round a friend's house and stole £50 from his sister's room, pretended to my parents I'd found it blowing in the wind in the street - spent it the next day on a Playstation One game - I still feel like a cunt to this day"
"Had a pretty big car accident whilst seeing what its like to drive with one arm. Other guy was coked up, took full responsibility and I took missus and son to Disney on the compo. Result."
I've just got a new job with a substantial pay rise and I've spent the last two days looking up friends/family/former colleagues/exes' likely salaries on Glassdoor to see who I'm ahead of now. After being depressed for 18 months it's done wonders for my self esteem.
"Caught sight of myself in a mirror in the pub. At some point in the last 18 months, I've become a deeply unattractive middle aged man. Shit."
It's best confessions for September. We've picked from the funny end and then ending with something else. Do please share so that the confessions keep coming and and remember: FOLLOW @FESSHOLE NOW. https://t.co/IPEbOWqJnd
"At work I have a lot of scope for using my own judgement in how I apply rules. On every call, I apologise for the wait and explain we're desperately short-staffed, primarily due to Brexit. Their reaction dictates the rest. Angry denial: rules rigidly applied to the letter."
"Not long after it reopened after the bombing, I was invited to a jolly hosted at London Stock Exchange. When I left, I kept the security badge as a souvenir. The building was locked down for 3 hours later that night whilst they searched the entire building for me."
"Great long term partner of 10 years, but never liked sex with him, I'd dried up downstairs and found it even worse. Recently met someone who gets me wet if I just think about him. I think about him all the time and sex life with over half has vastly improved."
"I found out where the man my wife had an affair with lives. I've been sending pizzas, taxis even paid some kids to egg his house. I have no plans on stopping"
"When I'm cleaning my cat's litter tray I pretend that I'm in that bit in Raiders of the Lost Ark where they're digging for the temple in the desert: Archaeology is not an exact science, Dr Jones I think to myself as I unearth yet another nugget of cat poo."
"I was in court defending a speeding charge. After the judge dispensed with the case, I performed a brief curtsy in deference. Folk in the viewing gallery burst out laughing 'cos I'm a 55 year old overweight beardy bloke. Still swear at myself because of it 10 years later."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something weird with a strange quark?
"When I think the toaster is about to pop, I wave an imaginary magic wand at it. Most of the time nothing happens but when the toast pops at the same time, I feel like a wizard."
"Occasionally I go through my phone and clean up the stored contacts , deleting ones I no longer use. However, I feel compelled to retain the details for people I know who have died, even for those I didn't really know that well."
Every Christmas I got a posh box of chocolates at work from a supplier. I gave them to the Mrs making her think I'd chosen them carefully and thoughtfully. One year they put their card inside the box. Why does this box of chocolates say 'Happy Christmas from Hornbill' in it?
"I tell myself that Photoshopping spots off portraits for the college prospectuses I design is to make the kids feel better about themselves. Really, I just don't like spotty people making my work look messy."
I'd had a tiny bit too much to drink last night and managed to piss all over the toilet seat and floor when I got up in the night. This morning my wife discovered the mess and blamed it on our 6 year old son - I didn't own up.
Too used to WFH... I'm back at the office today and so tired. I just absentmindedly opened a private browsing window and loaded up Pornhub. Stared at it for a few seconds then realised what I'd done and closed it. It's an open plan office.
Partner gutted when his helium birthday balloons deflated day after his birthday. No mystery. When he went to match with his mates and I inhaled it all while drinking two bottles of wine and singing along to my favourite tracks in a high pitched squeaky voice. Best afternoon ever
"I had a summer job as a lifeguard at the local pool. The husband of my Mum's friend used to come in 2-3 times a week, swim one length and leave. I told my Mum who asked her friend about it. Turned out he was using it as cover for his affair with his wife's sister. They divorced."
"I was 28 when I learned that it's artic-ulated lorry, not Arctic. I thought they were refrigerated lorries."
I'm a respected journalist and hate the Daily Mail and everything it stands for. But I still avidly read its fucking website every day because some of the stories on it are actually quite good. Bastards.
"I wear my wife's knickers to work, not sexy ones just ordinary ones as I DO get dressed in the dark"
"I've regularly been paying into a holding account for my mates kids, to be honest I've not seen them or their kids for years, still it's nice to wonder at the indifference they'll have at 18 to cash from a minor acquaintance"
"If my brexity neighbour spots me out the front of the house when I'm returning from a bike ride he always asks how far I've gone, I always answer in km because it winds him up"
"When I was a kid, our house was very close to a phone box. My bother and I used to smear the phone receiver in dog shit and then call the phone box from our house. When we saw someone answer, we said to them, 'Hello shithead!' At the time, we thought that was really funny."
My wife thinks the robin in our garden is a reincarnation of her late father. I couldn't tell her the cat killed it and dumped it's body in the kitchen. I put it in the food waster under a paper towel.
My brother left a scratch card lying around he was going to put in a birthday card. I scratched it and won a substantial amount of money on it. I then went to the shop and bought the same scratch card and left it where he left it.

I refuse to give business to any company who doesn't advertise with correctly spaced phone numbers or post codes.
When I feed my dog I always leave a trail of kibble leading to his bowl so I can pretend I'm Elliot when he's leading E.T through the house
"My boyfriend left his wife for me. She didn't show him affection, appreciate him or talk to him except to nag. Now we live together and he doesn't show me much affection, appreciate me or talk to me for much other than to fight. I've been fooled."
When I graduated in 1979 the envelope I received didn't contain my degree certificate but a letter demanding fines for late library books. I never paid the fines and never received my certificate. I have never been asked show it and I've recently retired as Head of Maths.
In order to prevent myself losing my shit with family life I often secretly pretend that I'm being filmed for a fly on the wall doc about superb parenting. This is responsible for 80% of craft activities and may also have prevented murders.
I make a mug of tea as reward for tidying the kitchen & starting the dishwasher - immediately resulting in one solitary dirtied teaspoon. It stays in the sink until the next day to torment me about this cycle that I just can't break and a reminder of my impending senility.
"I'm responsible for the electricity bill and my wife takes care of the water bill. If I see her taking a lenient approach to the kids leaving lights on, I turn on a tap in the bathroom and blame it on the kids when it's discovered."
I once had really bad piles so had to wipe with baby wipes. I went into the bathroom without my glasses on and reached for the wipes only to pick up the Bleach Bathroom cleaner wipes by mistake. My wife genuinely thought I'd be attacked because of the screaming.
My husband has been given several promotions at his work and thinks it's because he's earned them. I've been fucking his boss for a few years. His promotions mean longer hours away from home so I can continue to fuck his boss.
"I wanted to know what happened if you heated a thermometer above its maximum temperature. Answer, the glass tube breaks, the red liquid floods your boss's new kettle, and leaves a stain which won't come out."
When my grandma moved house she stole her old neighbours dog. The dog had spent it's life chained up to a kennel in a muddy garden. Authorities said no laws were broken as the dog had shelter and water. Grandma decided that was a shit answer. Dog lived a great life with her.
"I frequently scour the replies when someone on my local facebook group asks what the best Chinese takeaway is. Inevitably, it isn't long before the racists creep in. I report them. Every single time."
"My partner is bipolar, and is showing signs of becoming manic again. They always spend a fortune and will burn out and collapse for a fortnight. On the plus side, the sex is just astonishing"
My boyfriend is making us watch some stupid fucking guy Ritchie film. He's drunk and when he went for an extended shite so I skipped ahead about 40 minutes and he hasn't even noticed.
"Last ever day as a teacher, on bus duty, a little shit launched himself onto the top the kids in the queue. Pull him off his by his collar, he tells me he's going to get his dad. I said go for it, I'll get my dad and we'll kick fuck out of the pair of you. Was very liberating."
"When I am doing a lateral flow test, I pretend I am Renton or Sick Boy from Trainspotting cooking up one last hit."

I once pretended to be a competition winner on a local radio station for my mate who worked there as a producer just so he could keep the top prize for himself.
"I got a bus pass more than a year ago which most drivers around here have mistakenly assumed is a ticket, when in fact it's nothing more than a glorified ID card. I've saved more than £1000 in the last year with free bus travel I'm not entitled to."
"As much as I'm happy for comedy performers to be able to go back on stage now, I'm really missing all the lockdown livestreams. I had a little timetable and watched up to three a week. No-one else I knew watched any, but I loved getting to know the performers week after week."
Ive just been sent an email listing a number of upcoming dental appointments asking if I still wish them. Obviously I replied saying they are no longer required. Sorry to the bloke with the same name and very slightly different email address to me. I hope you dont travel too far.
"My wife wanted an awful first name for our son while she was expecting him, so I bribed my brother to adopt a dog from a shelter and give it the same name. Did the trick, and brother loves being a dog owner so all good."
I lectured my girlfriend at some length about the lifestyle and foibles of the artist whose work was being shown on TV. She was impressed but wouldn't be if she knew I was on about the wrong bloke. I can never let her look at a landscape again.
In order to fly on a sea plane you have to tell the pilot your weight so they can work out the required fuel for the flight. I lied about mine as I didn't want the hot girl to know I was 15 kilos heavier then I look. Putting everyone's lives at risk.
"Bought a cheap USB microscope to check my sperm in the hope I could avoid a vasectomy. Did the business before work and checked during the morning zoom meeting, my team then saw my swimmers when I shared my screen without realising."
"Forgot to flush a wank-tissue and left it sitting on top of the printer in the home office. A colleague called in to discuss a project. I could see him glancing at it occasionally during our discussion. I know he was wondering about it, but there was nothing I could do."
I'm finding it increasingly difficult not to scream I AM REALLY FUCKING BORED! on my work conference calls. It's a matter of time before it happens. I am becoming Reggie Perrin.
"I'm a gay woman and came out at uni. When I told my school friends they all took it well but I was a little put out when they didn't seem surprised. Turns out that after drinking half a bottle of vodka I'd tearfully confess, swear them to secrecy, pass out and forget everything."
"I have a morbid curiosity about anyone who dies - anyone. If I see that a colleague of my cousin's wife died, I search for info and photos to read about them and look at them, ponder that they are no longer alive, and wonder how they died."
"I run a decent sized company and I hate it, the stress is mental, the staff are wankers, the clients are arseholes and no one appreciates anything. I just want to quit it all and drive trains on the underground"
"I feel really fucking guilty about neutering my cat, poor thing"
"Every morning, whilst they eat breakfast, I loudly sing at my kids cer - cer - cereal to tune of Sussudio by Phil Collins"
"I secretly love it when the processed cheese sticks to the wrapper of a Sausage & Egg McMuffin, as I like to scrape it off with my thumb and or lick it from the wrapper when nobody is watching. Mmm delicious melty cheese scrapings…"
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something horrible with a game of thrones blu-ray box set?
"I woke up from a nap the other night to find my bf trying to hide what he was looking at on his phone. After much discussion, he finally showed me; it was a PDF, detailing the new font they're using on Ukrainian road signs. I wish it had been porn tbh"
"I am a very average looking 28 year blonde guy, 5'8. I moved to Japan for work. Whilst I never really had much female attention in Australia I am a sex god in Japan. Sadly I am going home at Christmas."
"I asked my best mate to be my little boy's godfather. 7 years on and he's forgotten every one of his birthdays. If I mentioned it I'd seem petty, but I'm so upset."
I was in my 30s before I found out that fire engines aren't just completely full of water.
Until recently I thought NSFW meant 'now start fucking wanking'
"My husband quit his job like an idiot and has been unemployed for so long I'm giving him one more week before I start doing cam sex, which would be a second job for me. If that goes on a full month, I'll use the extra income to get my own place. Lazy arsehole."
"Whenever I'm baking something, I always eat a few teaspoons of raw sugar. Can't help myself, sugar on its own is so nice."
"I work in paediatrics and regularly do newborn examinations in front of parents. Without exception, I always tell them their baby is especially cute, but 70% of them are just large pink hairy slugs."
"I'm close to being rumbled, the only thing I really know about AWS is what some of the acronyms stand for. I'm in charge of a massive new deployment at a company that hired me as a 'cloud expert' The only thing that kept my head above water is they all know less than I do."
I called Radio 1 at 3 in the morning whilst on acid to ask them how to make apple crumble.
I wish people would stop buying me experiences/tickets to shows as gifts. They're such a pain in the arse to organise and they're never as much fun as the person buying them think they are.
"I always take toast out of the toaster with a knife, as I do I look round to check my mum isn't there as she'd tell me off. I'm 57 and she died five years ago."
"As a taxi driver, I took a scrote into town. On arrival he said he had no money & monkey-walked off all cocky laughing. I drove back to his house & squeezed super glue into his door lock. Next day i drove past & saw a joiner replacing a smashed in front door."
"Bristol Weatherpoons 90/00s. Grammatically incorrect 'Your wanking' written on the wall. Painted over during a refurb. I rewrote it in same place, same appalling grammar but it made us smile."
As a 40 year old male I've started using moisturiser. I wish I'd started at 20. It's amazing.
"I've worked in IT for over 20 years and I still don't know which is a backslash and which is a forward slash, or confidently know when to use which. If it doesn't work I just switch to the other and see if that's any better."

"Relationships will make you lie on a dally basis. My girlfriend called me during lunch and asked did you miss me? I didn't, I don't. I live with her, she saw me 4 hours ago. I'm working! I have other things to think about. I answered yes, I missed you so much."
"Put a paper plate in my brother in law's dishwasher when badly hungover after a particularly drunken party. Turned to mush, blocked the drain and flooded his kitchen a couple of days later. Too embarrassed to ever confess."
"Two years ago, I accidentally put the wrong type of plastic into my recycle bin. The binmen refused to take it even when I took the offending plastic out. Since then, I've been spitefully planting the wrong type of recycling in my bins but where they can't see. Small wins."
I have just submitted a dissertation on Cuba in which I now realise I have misspelt Che Guevara's name 11 times
"Girlfriend at the time lived in a shared flat where the toilet was separate from the bathroom. I was in the shower, her flatmate in the loo. Badly needed a shit, no option but to squat over the plughole and poke it all down the drain. Still ashamed to this day."
"When I was about 11, I went to a friend's house for the first time and needed a poo while I was there. Did my business, flushed, no biggie. Turns out it clogged their loo and her dad spent an hour unblocking it with a plunger. She told me the next day and I never went back"
"Every time I take a shit, I experience a deranging panic halfway through passing a turd in case I have hallucinated that I am on the toilet, and am actually receiving Eucharist or something, then breathe a sigh of relief when I realise I am exactly where I need to be."
I've lost over three stone since lockdown began in 2020. I've told my colleagues I go to the gym now but the truth is I've stopped eating lunch and have an hour in bed instead seeing as I now work from home. My state of mind has never been better either.
"I get sad if I'm shopping for pet food and I see an old person buying the cheapest pet food they can buy. I imagine them living with their beloved pet in total poverty, keeping each other company. I want to buy some nice food for them but I never do."
"The best orgasms I've ever had in my life where when I was giving birth to my daughter. I have tried mentioning it to my health visitor but she just looks shocked. I now think I must be weird, but I know what I felt."
"In a busy pub, I pissed in a glass under the table as toilets were too far. A smart looking lady knocked the table and the pint of piss tipped over her. 40 years later, I still have visions of her brushing the piss of her skirt saying don't worry, it's only lager. Sorry luv."
The gym where I take our baby swimming has the nappy bin next to the machine that spin dries your swimming costume.Due to sleep deprivation I absent mindedly put my shorts in the bin and span dry a freshly shitted nappy.
My wife insists on keeping the ketchup in the fridge and not a day goes by that I don't consider this to be grounds for divorce. I don't even like ketchup.
I have a degree in a language I have never been able to speak fluently.
"I left the UK in 2003. Every time I return it makes me sad: surly jobsworths called Trisha or Kevin on passport control, potholed roads, unmowed verges, crappy houses, everything dirty. It's what I imagine visiting East Germany in 1988 must have been like only with less Trabants."
"My late dad was horse racing mad & he kept his gambling quiet. After he died I found a wad of cash in his winter coat on the coat rack. I then checked all his suits, coats, trousers & shoe boxes & found €1000s. I told no-one in the family & spent it all on booze & holidays."

Aged about 14 I shot my neighbour's milk carton - on their doorstep - with an air pistol. Milk leaked everywhere and looking back it must have been obvious it was me. They didn't complain and I kept quiet. Sorry Paul and Ira.
"Since getting a kicking from a group of lads trying to nick my bike when I was 8, I'm still scared to be out 32 years later."
Whenever I see someone choking I secretly make a pinching move with my fingers like darth Vader pretending I'm using the dark side of the force.
Made coffee for me and my very loud and annoying colleague at work. I accidentally made us both decaff and for the rest of the day he was a lot quieter and much less annoying. Unknown to him he's now a decaff drinker and I get some peace and quiet.
"I have no idea how to ask for a haircut. I just say 'make it shorter by a few cm', they ask if some number is ok and I say yes. I'm 27."
In the 90's I shared a flat with some mates. We had no locks on our rooms so one guy announced that if we heard Enter Sandman by Metallica that meant he was shagging his girlfriend. I now shudder every time I hear it. I'll never forgive them for ruining a fucking awesome song.
When I went to student parties and needed a piss I would go to the toilet and then try and direct my stream of urine into the toilet brush holder if there was one there.
My sister in law is an instagram influencer. I love reading people being bitchy about her on tattle life.
At sixth form me and another lad spent pretty much all our free periods heading a screwed up ball of paper over the table between ourselves. By the end of upper sixth our record was 54. We both fucked our A Levels up.
I'm 42 and my wife still has to guide it in for me
"I was using a dating site when I got together with my girlfriend, now wife offline. I went to cancel my membership of the site and saw there was a message but I decided just to cancel without seeing who wrote to me. An eternal mystery I think about over 10 years later"
I once found a wallet with £80 inside. 
I pocketed £40 and personally delivered the wallet to his letter box with a note attached; I think I deserve half for saving you an inconvenience replacing bank cards and family photos. I always wonder if he was grateful or livid.
When I was 17 I didn't like my Dad to much after a family break up. I slept with his then girlfriend for revenge I was 17 she was 36 and I took great delight in telling him. Went back for 2nds and 3rds. I'm now 44 and have some regrets. Sorry
"GCSE English, teacher told us to write a short sequel to of mice and men. I wrote on my paper if one was good enough for John Steinbeck then it's good enough for me I got detention but she didn't make me redo the original assignment,"
Went to a music festival all weekend in hopes of testing positive and having 10 days in bed
"Going through my recently deceased Dad's piles and piles of paper recently, found a highly graphic story I'd written in amongst them written in the first person as a feminised sex slave - can't even remember why I wrote it. Knowing he once saw it makes me cringe so hard."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something sexy with a pease pudding?
"When I'm feeling a bit lonely I'll ask on the socials what's the best series to binge watch as I've just finished one. I get lots of replies and nice messages. I don't have Netflix, Prime etc"
I'm beginning to think my love for my wife and child is some form of Stockholm Syndrome.
"Whenever my partner is returning from a trip, I make up some flimsy excuse to find out exactly what time she's going to be back. This is so I can squeeze in at least one last wank and frantically tidy the house before she arrives home."
"In my early 20s, I told the bank I was in a permanent job. They didn't check and gave me a personal loan of several thousand to carry on getting drunk every week. Years later I claimed PPI compensation on that loan and awarded £7k. I went to Las Vegas."
"I find the weather forecast strangely erotic. Seeing a well dressed women talking about pressure systems, or the risk of thunder, does it for me. I am concerned my wife might one day ask me about my biggest fantasy or suggest role play."
I work for a company that recently got bought out by a large US firm. They forgot about me. It's 6 months now and I've been paid every month. I login every day and browse the internet.
"One day, in my mid teens I was given the task of potting plants into hanging baskets, I knew manure was good for soil so I put dog sht underneath the plants. Later, water from the plants would drip onto rhubarb which grew well. For years I wouldn't eat mum's rhubarb crumble"
"I've spent 10 years convincing my kids I can speak fluent Chinese by just emulating the sounds from kung-fu films, and now I'm scared to tell them it's a joke"
"Had an arsehole boss, years ago, so I snuck into his office, glued his office thermostat to 13 degrees Celsius, then glued the cover back on. Fucker spent the entire winter shivering like a leaf before building services could fix it."
Went on a romantic weekend with my new girlfriend and was incredibly constipated. I had to get it out of me before we had sex so went to the toilet and pulled it out with my fingers. The bathroom smelled like death and I felt so guilty stroking her hair and face with Poo Finger
"Whenever a website is pissing me off, I use a new password that insults the company - URArseh0les1, Sh!tSh0w99, that kind of thing - in the hope they store them in plain text and the chief exec one day asks for a print out."
"To stop myself from blowing my load too early during sex, I often think about ex-Southampton defender Ken Monkou going up for a header."
I've recently grown a beard. I love my beard. This week I went on my first date since last year. All good but for one thing. When you kiss a woman my beard makes it feel to me like they have stubble. Even checked. I now have to choose between beard and having sex. Beard may win.
Married for 10 years and made a massive mistake a cheated with someone on a weekend away. My husband noticed our sex was better after that weekend and encouraged not to go more weekends away. I was just putting in more effort because I was so guilty.
I once tried to suck my own dick using a pipe from a vacuum cleaner to help me reach. The suction forced extra blood into my lips and they turned purple. I made up a story to explain the colour of my lips which I had to repeat many times.
My brother moved abroad and bequeathed me his beloved collection of single malts. Every now and then he asks me how it is and I say yeah the Lagavulin is a real treat or whatever. Truth is most of it I mix with Coke or Fanta
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something horrible with a speed camera?
I rarely get emotional. I told my partner I was feeling awkward after I welled up today. She was really happy I was sharing. When I explained it was about seeing Ronaldo return to Man Utd & scoring a brace she wasn't happy. She thought it was going to be about our baby.
"I'm a woman with a PhD in English Literature. I tell everyone I need a man who is my intellectual equal. But to be honest, the most fulfilling relationship I ever had was 6 months with a rugby player who was thick as two short planks"
Had to order a new debit card a few months ago. I order food late doors every weekend in the pub for everyone and it always turns up. I've got no idea how it gets payed for but it's certainly not coming out of my bank account.
There is nothing more embarrassing than being in your mid 20s and needing to buy medication to treat threadworms. The one thing I don't understand is how I managed to get them - I live alone and I have good personal hygiene.
I've watched The Abyss loads of times but I've always been really stoned and I still have no clue what the fuck it's about or why they're all on that boat.
"My beloved girlfriend of 5 years had a cyst behind her ear and I went with her to the GP to have it fixed. The moment I witnessed the thing sliced open and green pus flow out, our relationship was over in my mind. A week later I broke up with her over nothing."
My boss once told me the security cameras in our shop were just for show. From that day onwards I skimmed the tills until one month I got too greedy and the boss fired the new guy because we were £400 down that month.
I once spent an entire pay check on a crypto scam that was tweeted from a fake celebrity account. Yeah I'm one of those. I work in IT. Had to take a mortgage payment holiday
"When I started dating my wife I pretended to have a really obvious tell, when lying. I kept using it and to this day she thinks she can detect my lies."
"I am the same age as Vanessa Paradis, so I can say this - I've never bothered to translate the lyrics of Joe le taxi for fear of disappointment. I've always assumed it was a song about her giving Joe a hand job for a ride home."
"It was recently pointed out to me at a meal with my in-laws and extended family that I eat with the knife and fork the wrong way round. I'm 37 and never knew what a dining faux pas this was. Fuck em though, I'm not changing it now, the 'correct' way can do one."
When I was at school I had a Saturday job working in a bakery. One of the jobs was filling donuts with jam. One pump of jam was ample but every now and again I'd do a donut with three pumps. I liked to imagine someone getting a load of jam down a clean white shirt.
I met Prince Charles at my workplace in 2018 and I was tasked with making him a cup of tea - one spoon of honey if anyone cares. I made it with about 3 teaspoons of honey just to see what would happen. Put the milk in first too. He just drank it like a trooper. No drama.
A married mate of mine nips off for causal sex with another woman. Part of me wonders how he deals with the guilt but on the other hand he shares all the filthy details with me so I never question his reasoning.
Whenever I drop the car off at the garage I leave the radio tuned to radio one so the mechanics think I'm cool. As soon as I pick it up I retune to radio 2.
Today I had to go down and get my reading glasses before having a wank as my phone screen suddenly seemed too small. I am officially old.

I found an old thumb drive with 6 bitcoins on it from mining days. I gave three of them to a charity before checking the exchange rate. I now feel sick.
Im determined to let my partner be the first to say I love you. Until that happens I've been mouthing it under my mask when we're on public transport.
"Had sex on 9/11 20th anniversary. Doggy style, pausing a moment to consider her bum cheeks as 2 buildings, and my dick as a plane."
I've collected all my earwax from the last 12 months. It isn't as impressive as I had hoped for.
"I don't always wear my wedding ring, but always put it on before getting on my motorbike because at some level I reckon I'll get better hospital treatment if I have an accident"
At Uni I lived with 3 other boys and 4 girls . One of the girls used to scream like a maniac whilst having sex . The other 7 of us would stand outside her room and listen enviously
Just a reminder that @fesshole has a lovely sponsor 
Years ago I worked for a large retailer that was in administration. Didn't bank the takings for a week & just took them. Paid for the whole family to go on the trip of a lifetime to the states. Got my bonus too. Not an ounce of regret.
"Saw my brother looking in a shop window, went up and slapped him on the back who's been eating all the pies then?! It wasn't my brother."
"I once kidnapped a neighbours garden gnome and left a ransom note, they'd bought the place recently and had a hundred of the bloody things."
"It made the local paper and to this day my daughter still combs the internet for the article, it's her favourite anecdote ever."
I once tried to convince my ghost obsessed lodger to move out by opening all the doors and drawers in her room every time she went out.
When I was younger I used to think we were running out of rare steaks.
"If it wasn't for Twitter, I would probably have gone through life having slept with 3 people. 2 proper relationships and 18 hookups would never have happened."
"Thanks to having to hear Thanks be to God' every day at primary school, I grew up thinking that God's first name was Peter. Thanks, Peter God."
"I love watching rejected marriage proposals on YouTube. The more public and embarrassing the better, especially if there's a musician or photographer who carry on after the girl has run off."
"When I was a teenager i used to regularly steal my mums car when she wasn't home, and drive it whilst uninsured and drunk. I was never caught. I'm now a traffic cop and target people like me."
"My son got lent an Oculus virtual reality headset. I borrowed it to check the content was appropriate, found VR porn, and now I'm completely addicted to it."

"My son borrowed a pair of my ex husbands pants. After washing, instead of returning them I put them in my boyfriends drawer. I now make him wear them when he fucks me because it reminds me of how good sex with my ex was. He has no idea, just thinks I've developed a pants fetish"
"My primary school teacher told me the capital of Wales was Cornwall. With no reason to doubt her, I believed that was fact until corrected at the age of 19 when trying to flirt with a cute Cornish girl. What a long play clock block."
Used to be a manager at a food hall and came downstairs to find my staff doing a cardboard box bobsled down a ramp. I ripped their heads off but it looked great and I should have just joined in.
"I take my phone everywhere with me, even if I get up briefly from the sofa. The wife probably thinks I'm having an affair, but actually I just really care about upping my steps and distance covered to beat my previous daily average from last year!"
Stayed at a really posh hotel for a wedding and shat myself. When I got back to my room I chucked my pants out the window. I woke to the sound of hotel staff trying to find a ladder long enough to get some shitty pants off the flagpole out the front.
I don't go on wild roller coasters at theme parks. My family thinks it's because I am way scared. The reality is that it makes me have big orgasms which is beyond embarrassing.
"I drew a massive cock and balls on my friends marriage guest book, I had a few drinks. My friend automatically presumed it was Liam that did it. I happily agreed with this and remained silent. His wife still is so angry about this and no longer talks to Liam."
I'm married with four young boys. I only ever go for a shit straight after my wife has been to the toilet so I don't need to clean the kids piss off the toilet seat.
When using the self service checkout I evaluate how good value I think my shopping is to decide whether or not I pay for the plastic bag. If I think I've got some good deals then I'll scan it but if I feel it's expensive then I'll steal it.
"As an investment banker I would often go on midweek lunchtime benders with a colleague. A few drinks in we would phone up competitors at other banks pretending to be clients deeply interested in their work. Wasted hours of their afternoons. Sorry Wyn, Peter, etc, etc."
I was born on February 29 1968. My childhood memories are of other kids' birthdays. I only ever had a happy birthday when I was 20 and a boyfriend surprised me with a party. February 28 or March 1 is not the same and February 29 seems to come around only when I am alone.
"I don't get why some people are only into tall guys. So if I have to choose between a hot guy who's 57 and a hot guy who's 6, I pick the short one. There must be a reason why the tall one is single and it's not height/looks..."
"Was selling my house and got a builders report. Came back with lots of issues. Converted PDF and changed the report, then PDF again. Sold house straight away. Still wake up in cold sweats thinking about what I did 15 years ago."
I am a property manager for a large block of upmarket flats. I divorced 4 years ago and started staying in a room that was supposed to be a store room. I fully converted it - no bills and free accommodation.
I have my first boyfriends name and a heart tattood on the sole of my foot - yeah it hurt. Been married for 10 years and my husband has not ever noticed.
"I speak a dozen languages. I have a personal goal to fuck a speaker of each language that I speak. I've fucked people from around the world: Germans, Chinese, Swedish, etc. Almost there with my goal, just need to shag a Welsh speaker and an Esperanto speaker."

"1994, November, Roehampton university. I innocently and drunkenly called the operator and asked what do you do if you smell gas. It turns out you call the London fire brigade and evacuate several hundred people from a hall of residence at 2am"
"Every time I see a flood warning sign I pretend I am Andrew Eldritch, of The Sisters of Mercy and I repeat FLOOD loudly in my head."
I haven't read 95% of the books on my shelves and likely never will. I still buy more.
I'm a 37 year old woman and I have no - absolutely no - idea how to put on makeup. I feel like an idiot
"I've met the most perfect guy, he's kind, funny and couldn't do enough for me. Unfortunately he's terrible in bed. Doesn't know what a female orgasm is and can't keep it up. He told me he's in love with me though..."
I went out with a guy for two months who proudly sent me a picture of his new tattoo on our eighth week together - it was my name! Ran away.
"Use to work with a guy called Angus who was a bit of an arse. Every time he left his desk with his PC unlocked, I'd change his email signature so that his name in it read Anus"
"My neighbour has a shed with a giant sound system at the bottom of his garden, which backs onto the side of my house, and uses it constantly. My solution was to move the bin that houses used nappies and colostomy bags to right next to his shed, and refuse to put a lid on it. Win."
"I worked as a glass collector in a fun pub in the late 80s. We had a couple come in every weekend who was openly bi swingers. The wife was so hot I let her husband shag me just so I could have a 69 with her. I'm not gay but it was worth it, and I've never told this to anyone"
"I'm having an affair with a much younger colleague. She's funny, beautiful and the sex is incredible, but last night she told me that she firmly believes aliens are not only monitoring life on earth but live among us. So now I'm going to have to end it."
I have no idea which of the Gallagher brothers is which and zero interest in finding out
"Been with my partner for nearly 6 years, lived together for nearly 5, love them deeply, still can't convince them to get rid of the fucking unicycle. They don't ride it. It's just taking up space in the house."
"When my mother started expressing her frustration about people by saying I'm going to give him a good fisting rather than saying I'd like to give him a slap, I was never brave enough to explain. Someone stepped in as she stopped abruptly after using it for six months"
Just had to deny having a secret office toaster to the building manager whilst eating a piece of toast. This is the closest I'll ever get to being in an episode of Seinfeld.
Finished with a girl once because she said if she died before me and I found somebody new she would haunt me forever. I dont even believe in ghosts but it wasn't worth the risk.
I have an Instagram about all the hills and mountains I hike up. It's now pretty popular so I guess I'm an influencer. What I don't tell people is the reward I give myself for getting to the top is a nice big toot of coke. Without it I probably wouldn't bother

Got drunk at a wedding reception and sucked off my boyfriend in the toilets midway through. Thought I cleaned up but in all the photos afterwards you can see a teeny tiny drop of cum in my hair. Pray to god no-one has noticed.
For my Music GCSE composition I totally stole the main hook from Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus. I don't think they clocked even though I ended up getting just a C overall
"Worst thing I ever did was stealing my friend's Magic: The Gathering cards when we were 12. Ended up burning the entire deck to avoid getting caught but fucked up and burned myself, you can still see the scars on my hands. They would have been worth a mint by now, regret it"
"When I'm driving and someone is driving really slowly in front of me, I make machine gun noises and shake my steering wheel like I'm firing at the car in front. Very cathartic."
"6 months ago my wife and kids wanted a cat and a dog, and I reluctantly acquiesced. Now my family all spend time with the pets, and I hate being in my own house."
"Met a fantastically clever, beautiful and funny woman. Also wealthy. When we went to bed I found she was wearing a scent that made her smell just like my mother. Immediate soft-on, never explained the reason for breaking it off. Similar hairstyle didn't help at all."
"I know it's wrong, but I join up my capital letters when I write and I love it."
If I order Dominoes I will 'create a pizza' thats an exact replica of one off their standard menu. I don't really know why I do this.
My wife holds parallel conversations with me and the dogs at the same time and now I don't know if I'll ever detect the onset of dementia in her as she gets older.
"I'm relatively young and look young for my age and still get IDed. When charity people come begging at the door, I tell them I'll let my parents know rather than parting with cash. I live alone."
"When my kids were younger I used to pretend I was working, drive to Birmingham airport and sleep all day in a hotel bedroom. Sometimes I'd take a sick day to do it. Wake up. Have a deep bath. Drink the free coffee and biscuits and get home just after bedtime."
"Our weekly 5-a-side was joined by a bloke who played professionally for a number of years. He was outstanding, even post-retirement. I once joked with him I'd put it on my CV that I dribbled past him. It still makes me cringe to this day."
Size does matter. I've been with a guy whose penis was the size of a dainty finger and I've been with a guy whose penis was the size of a medium sized zucchini. Neither was enjoyable. I even ended up with a bruised cervix because of the second one.
"I've been at my job since mid 2017. I have 20,566 unread emails and 29,454 emails in total."
"When I'm on a boring work call, I pull up an attractive person going live on TikTok and pretend I'm talking to them."
"When England play an International football game I often tailor my porn searches based on the nationality of the opposing team. Had some good nights after we've played Germany, Poland, Columbia and Spain. Less so San Marino."

I've a secret bank account where I keep my gambling winnings. I'm quite good at it and have a high 4 figure sum in there. Love my wife & kids so I'm not planning on running off or anything. Just feel like I've left it too long to tell her now.
"Received a box of 1,000 licorice magic wands for my birthday. Ate them all in one sitting and shat the blackest, black shit for several days"
One time I ordered a drink from across the bar to a young lady I thought was attractive - like they do in the movies. She was totally mortified when she got the drink; turns out she was with her parents and boyfriend. Got the hell out of there pretty fast
"My wife drinks decaf tea with skimmed milk, I drink normal tea with semi skimmed. If she's being grumpy I make my drink first then hers with the same spoon, if she's really pissing me off I give her semi skimmed milk."
"After I do a poo, I always stand to attention and salute whilst I flush. Been doing it for 30 years and won't stop now."
When I was a kid I was told that if you eat the black part of banana then you will die. I'm 35 and I'm still not gonna roll those dice.
"If it's late and the tooth fairy doesn't have any change, he takes coins from the piggy bank on the table beside the pillow with every intention of paying it back. 8 years and many teeth later, I don't think my daughter has made more than £1"
I had a huge shit while staying at my in laws caravan. It wouldn't flush so I fished it out & lobbed it out the window. It stuck to the side of the next door caravan next door. They thought it was from the noisy family so it kicked off. Best fun I've had for ages.
I set up a secret tinder profile for a single male friend who never had a girlfriend even though he was in his 30s and spent three months trying to find someone to go out on a date with him. I never got one match and never told him about it
"My ex girlfriend loved a finger up her bum during sex. I don't miss her, but I do miss having an excuse to immaculately manicure my fingernails."
I told my wife and and teenage kids that I had to go to an old family member's funeral. I fact I went to watch Steps in concert on my own. I'm a 38 year old man.
"I just publicly blamed my PA for screwing up some meeting requests. I'd buy her some flowers, but she's a figment of my imagination."
Our neighbour proudly tends her show garden & show vegetables. I recently spotted that she throws windfalls from the border trees & shrubs over onto our side rather than putting them in her green waste bin. I now collect slugs at night time and lob them across into her garden
"In the 70's my dad was a delivery driver for an ice cream company, as you can imagine we had a freezer full of it and were pretty popular on our street. Only years later did I realise that every single Fab, Zoom and Choc Ice I have ever eaten were stolen."
To celebrate my son passing his GCSE's and getting into the college course he wanted… we went for our 1st ever father and son spliff then had a Nando's.
I presumed I shot blanks as I never had any pregnancy scares. In my late 30's my partner suggested we try for a baby and I went along just for the sex. We've got a 3 year old now and she looks exactly like me. Never fails to surprise me and make me smile that she's in my life.

"Used to work for a well known middle class groceries delivery company. Can cancel damaged items and not get questioned on where they were or how they were damaged. Didn't buy lunch for 2 years, and tried lots of delicious posh food."
"Between 13 & 15 I had a morning paper round. I didn't deliver many papers because the round was all spread out. There were many times when 215 Rugby Rd didn't get their paper because it was too fucking far out. And it was a Times and FT, so the bag was lighter without it. Soz 215"
I use more than one teabag to make tea more quickly. For a large mug I will use four teabags.
"When I was a student I used to go to the newsagents pick up a Melody Maker & NME, wrap one inside the other & bang them on the counter. Most of the time they didn't realise and only charged me for one magazine. If they did see I paid for both, but I must have saved a fair bit."
"I once sat in on an social work interview. A 4 year old had accused six people of hitting him including his mum + dad, and a childminder. When we went to leave, he ran to his distraught mum, wailing, pointing at us: They hit me too. "
"Decided then and there, never having kids."
My other half got upset when I asked her to let me know when she was going to have a period so that I could arrange my wank schedule. Seems fair enough to me. No point in both of us suffering.
"Decided to try and make 'bachelor chow' from Futurama for real, by mixing a tin of beans and a tin of Haggis. Actually tastes pretty good."
"I've had ten bosses in all my working life six of whom were called Chris, four of those six were arseholes. My wife decided that our daughter would also be called Chris. I had no say in the matter. I fucking hate that name."
"Everyone I work with, take note. When I ask if you would like a chewing gum I'm not being nice, it's because your breath stinks."
I found £400 cash and a cheque for £100 in the bottom of a board game that I bought for 50p from a charity shop. I just ripped up the cheque and kept the cash. Never crossed my mind to give some/all of it to the charity shop.
"I look in the bag every time I choose my letters in Scrabble. Fuck it, it's a stupid game anyway."
"I regularly hide cooked sausages in and around work - coffee jars, briefcases, coat pockets, desk draws - you name it I've hidden one there. Me and a mate did it years ago for a laugh and I've continued. I'm the 'phantom sausager'."
25 years ago I closed a career defining deal that lead to a lucrative management position. The client only closed the deal with me after I told them the guy they called had died. I live well. The other guy drives an Uber. Feel awful.
"When I have to unlock my phone with Face ID, I play a game where try to trick it by pulling a face. Although it's counterintuitive as I need to access my phone, I'm proud to say that I 'win' against Face ID about 60% of the time."
"Black bin is only emptied fortnightly so in the night I often chuck my smelly rubbish in the nearby park bins, council empty those every couple of days"
"Despite how crap the relationship with my ex was, her family were properly sound and I lost some really close friendships when we split up. My current gf is amazing and our relationship is great, but I can't help wishing I could replace her shite family with that of my ex."

"When staying in hotels, I drink the expensive water from the minibar and re fill it from the tap for the next guest."
"All the new build tower blocks are 'investors only' marketed by the same company. Made a script to make loads of fake viewing appointments to waste their time. I just want to buy to live but can't, they piss me off"
"Am I the only one who can see a face in a full Moon? I'm 40 next year and have only told my partner this. She can see it, which fucks me off"
I've spent years reciting an anecdote about a boy in my class who shat himself at the end of a lesson and disposed of his very soiled pants in the Deputy Head's office because he was too scared to go to the toilets where the big kids were smoking at break. It was really me.
I keep crisps in the fridge.
I'm forever putting washing tablets in the dishwasher and dishwasher tablets in the washing machine. No one seems to notice.
"When my son is playing Fortnite in his bedroom and shouting like an loon I block his MAC address on the Wi-Fi for a few minutes just to bug him, he things our broadband is rubbish."
"About 15 years ago the consultancy I worked for were taken on as part of a rebranding exercise for Dorothy Perkins, who were losing confidence in their name. Will never forget the whiteboard with DP, DP . com, DP Live, DP Petites, DP Plus Size etc all over it"
"I went from a £9 per hour data entry job, to a £46,000 per year role initially, simply by copying someone else's CV and reading about their market/industry every night for 2 weeks before my interview to make it sound like I had a clue. Been in the role for 10 years today."
Was in a bank with a mate when it got robbed. Robbers lined everyone up and started taking their wallets and phones. It was then I decided to pay my friend the 50 quid I owed him.
"I adore women and love sex, but always feel really depressed once it's over. Whereas women tend to want to talk and be affectionate, I just want to sleep or watch TV in silence. I'm sure I come across as a miserable git, but I'm actually feeling like shit, and I've no idea why"
"In my teenage years, I noticed that a show called 'Loose Women' aired on ITV in the middle of the night. In my constantly horny state, I believed this to be some sort of porn/adult show. Imagine my disappointment after staying up until 2am to watch it."
Any time I get the opportunity I fart on my girlfriend's cat's head. He's a little prick.
Had a one-to-one on Zoom with a colleague today so I wrote 'You're a nob and drew an arrow on a Post-It and stuck it on my screen with the arrow pointing to his face. Suddenly meeting was fun.
Whist going down on my girlfriend I thought it would be funny to say NOM NOM NOM. She's now my ex.
"Around 9 years ago, I vomited on a sleeping girlfriend's face after a night out. She was more annoyed about the carpet rather than being woken up with vomit. We dated for a few years after this."

"My grandad delivers us home cooked meals three nights a week and thinks he's doing me, a busy mum of young kids, a favour. However his personal hygiene and kitchen cleanliness is somewhat lacking-we bin the food straight away and order in on Deliveroo"
It baffles me how anyone ever initiated sex in the days before you could whatsapp your partner in bed next to you with suggestive remarks.
"As a stutterer, when I was a school I made sure my speech therapy clashed with PE classes. When the therapy ended I told no one and I missed an entire year worth of PE classes."
"As a side hustle I sell my wife used pants for £20 a pair, well that's what my web site says, in reality I have no wife, I'm a fat sweaty bloke who just rubs a clean pair on my ass crack a few times and posts them out to stratified customers - sorry guys"
"Early 00s lads mags used to include 'tried and tested' sex tips. Which is how I ended up with a Crunchie up my foof. Yes, the chocolate layer melted but the inside didn't fizzle as promised. And I got a bonus yeast infection for my troubles."
"I had a wank in class when I was 14 or 15. I was sure I was being super stealthy but a while later a classmate referenced me doing it. It was 20 years ago, and I don't see anyone I went to school with anymore, but it makes me die inside thinking that everyone fucking knew."
"One of the helpdesk staff left on his lunch and never came back, wouldn't answer his phone to management to say why he left.It could be something to do with him going to show me something on his personal laptop and accidentally showing me a pic of him having a wank."
"I work from home for a call centre. If a customer's being an arsehole I occasionally sweetly tell them I'm speaking to a supervisor, put them on hold, and drink. I never do this with customers who are at least civil."
If my husband pisses me off I hang his pants on the washing line inside out so his skid marks are on display.
My family has owned a late night kebab shop in a busy student city for over 30 years. I worked there and struggled with obnoxious drunks and casual racists. Revenge was a special Naga chilli sauce replacing their requested topping. Ironic thing is that no one has ever complained.
"Spent years buying crap on Amazon. Now panicking because I am getting to 50 with a large mortgage. Every time I see something I want, I now quickly make a mortgage overpayment to the amount of the item. £3000 in 2 months 😬😬"
"I had a morbid desire to experience the end of the world, but Covid has taught me that it would probably be a long, drawn out, boring affair and I can't imagine the levels of tedium the Conspiracy Theorists would manage."
"Whenever I collect my daughter from school, I loiter around and make a slow exit. This is so the teachers don't think I'm a random paedo who has waltzed in and tricked them into handing over a victim."
A few years ago me and my mrs weren't in a good place and I had a few one nights stands. One of the girls' flats is now located on my quickest cycle to work route. I now have to take a three mile detour every single day to stop me feeling guilty as I pass.

"I was made redundant during the first lockdown. I duly handed over my laptop and keys, but didn't mention the widescreen HD monitor I had taken home at the start of lockdown."
"Camping on Dartmoor and thinking I was in a very private spot, I was discovered having a naked poo by a German family. Made eye contact and waved."
"For my convenience I once removed the sticker from my kid brother's cherished Born in the USA cassette, leaving it plain, and then recorded over it with Led Zeppelin IV. A pack of C60's cost under £3 at the time."
At a house party as a teenager I printed out a load of dog porn and hid it inside random books around the house. I wonder how many the parents have found in the twenty or so years since.
"While sitting on the throne i realised I'm in my 40s and had never seen my butthole, so took a selfie with my iPhone. Don't know why I expected to see a glowing Taylor Swift-esque ringpiece, because I saw one of the most repulsive sights imaginable. Couldn't delete quick enough."
After 40 years I've realised why everyone thinks I'm weird. It's because I am weird.
"Drunkenly agreed to a foursome with some acquaintances at uni. Always thought I was pretty average but turned out I was at least half the size of the other lads. Panicked and went soft, blamed it on whiskey dick and made a hasty exit. Never saw any of them again."
"Ever since I discovered twisting my nipples calmed me down, as a kid, I have carried it on into adult life. An argument with the mrs? Fought with the boss? Damn right I'm in the loo twisting my damn nipples!"
I grab and eat a handful of frozen peas every time I open the freezer. Love them.
"Infant son dropped carrot purée onto someone's white handbag while at pub lunch. Assumed it'd wipe off so didn't mention it. Days later I discovered the purée stains everything it touches, also the bag was by Hermés. Sorry if this ruined your bag - I haven't got £6k to rep..."
Lockdown discovery: I can play a skiffle/washboard beat by stretching my wet balls out with one hand and using the other to scratch them & slap my cock down over my wrist at the same time. Spent quite a bit of time working out different rhythms. No one will ever hear the result.
"I had a lovely weekend catching up with my best mate from Uni who I've not seen for years, also got to meet his new wife…. again. I've not seen her since a couple of wild nights during freshers. Made for an interesting lunch, the two of us pretending we have never met before."
"I am about to flunk my Master's. I failed a summer assessment, and am about to hand in a terrible dissertation. My girlfriend and parents have supported me through the entire thing, and think I'm on course for a good grade. Not sure whether to tell them or keep the lie going."
"I earned a bit of cash back in the 2000s as a DJ. After working a wedding party out in the countryside one night, I was packing my kit away and saw the guest book left on a table. There was hardly anyone around, so I anonymously wrote AMAZING DISCO in the book."
We do air con re-gassing in cars. Easiest money ever. Air con systems are sealed and only leak if there's something wrong. We can do 10 £60 recharges for someone who potentially should just pay £100-200 to have it fixed permanently
"My wife thinks I'm taking one for the team doing the family food shop once a week. Truth is I do it for the single can of beer at the beach on my way home, it's pretty much as fun as it gets now."

My teenage daughter hates me taking her photo. Her friends take some lovely photos of her which she will often use as her Whatsapp profile pic & changes this regularly. I screenshot these pictures & save them to my photos so I have some of her now.
"As a kid I once stole £30 from a friend's house and spent it on Iron Maiden albums. I then had to steal the same amount from my Mum's purse to cover it up. She never noticed, but the albums always sounded a bit tainted to me."
"As a student in the early 90s, I bought the Right Said Fred album and listened to it ironically."
Thank fuck I don't keep in touch with anyone from those days who might remember.
"Just listening to some early 90s techno and realising that, as a 51 year old guy, I'm never again going to experience anything even close to the absolute pure unadulterated joy of coming up on some really good pills in a sweaty club and dancing till 8am. Nothing comes close."
"I turned up at the office this week for the 1st time since lockdown simply to take pens, pencils, rulers, rubbers, highlighters & a whole ream of A4 for the kids start of term. I will now go back to working from home until supplies run low."
"If I make a complaint and, after a response or two, realise I'm being fobbed off, I then BCC the company's owner/CEO/MD etc. into all subsequent correspondence. I've sparked off more than one internal review of company operations."
Got into the taxi Shane McGowan was getting out of to discover he left his cigarettes with a big nodge of black in. Happy days.
I was today years old when I realized the 3 finger swooshing action I use to wash up glasses and cups is pretty much the same technique I use when fingering my wife. I just don't use a dishcloth on the wife.
"Ever since I read 'The Girl on the Train,' I always look for a dead body in the undergrowth at the side of the tracks if I'm on a train that has slowed down or stopped outwith a station."
During the lockdown I made sure I would go out a cycle through the posh parts of town when the middle class twats were doing their clap for carers. I'd imagine I was in a race and the were clapping for me as I went past shouting the occasional thank you to them.
This time of year well-meaning friends with allotments or cultivated gardens shower us with tons of runner beans. They all go straight in the bin.
"I once drunkenly bought a gram of cocaine, put it in that tiny pocket in my jeans and forgot about it. I unwittingly smuggled it through several airports,"
Cancelled my direct debit that paid for an Empire magazine subscription in 2015 but they still send it. I'm moving house soon so will have to start buying it again.
"As a student, had an agency job driving articulated lorries. One time I was sent down the M6 in a Tesco truck. Noticed it was a fridge trailer. It was off. Worried for the contents, I switched it on, temp went to -18. Got to the depot. The trailer was full of crisps. Frozen ones."

Despite being in my 30s when I'm home alone when I go upstairs I lean forward and use my hands like a child and say 'I'm doing the monkey' to myself because that's what my flat mate at uni called it.
"When I was a kid I used to fantasise that I was adopted and my real mum was Paula Abdul, who had to give me away to avoid a scandal. Then one day she would decide to find me, take me away to live with her. I have no idea why Paula Abdul."
"I have two sisters - I've turned down sex with people who share the same names as them, that would be just too weird for me to say their name at the moment of climax."
"As cunty kids, we stole our kind old art teachers treasured film cameras in class & dumped them in bins on our way home. I'll never forget his face when he tearfully asked the class about it next day. I'm a pro photographer now and will take the immense guilt to my grave."
I really enjoy going to gay clubs. The vibe is always much friendlier and the music is usually better. But I'm not at all attracted to men and often feel like I'm trespassing.
I'm an estate agent and my OH has started booking in viewings just so we can have sex in strangers houses. One of these days someone's going to have one of those google camera things and I'm gonna get sacked. Totally worth it though.
"I'm a minority from a racist town. Whenever I go back to my town, I play 'slur bingo' where I count up how many slurs I get and if they're original. Makes the abuse feel more like a game and less like abuse."
Stole a car for a laugh in 96. Panicked and asked my grandad if I could store it in his barn. Didn't say it was stolen. It's still there.
"I bite my nails off and hide them down the back of the sofa, no one ever finds out as I'm the only one who hovers behind it. A couple of times a year I'll pull it forward to hoover and I'm a little proud of the mountain that's piled up."
"I only become a gas engineer as a guy I knew claimed he got laid 4 times a week by sexy mums & earned £150k. Ffwd 20 years & the closest I got was an offer of a blow job from a broke, single mum. Ended up repairing her boiler for free as I felt bad & turned down the oral."
Used to work in a care home and an old lady offered me £20 to squeeze her boob. Obviously I rejected and she looked dejected. She's died 3 weeks later and I often think I should have took one for the team and let her have it for free.
"Worse thing about working from home - having to buy my own sugar, salt and toilet roll instead of taking it straught from work."
"I'm responsible for my teenage granddaughter thinking that The Doors' L. A. Woman was sung by Homer Simpson. It started as a joke, but now it's too late to own up."
"Daughter's first day of secondary school today. As I pulled up to the school, a bloke in a Mini was hogging the narrow road, I mouthed fucking cunt at him to his face, and then watched in horror as he pulled in to the staff car park."
My flatmate consistently gets black out drunk and I've flat out had enough. Recently he passed out in the living room and we took his pants off and shit in his room. He woke in horror and hasn't drank in a month.

"Do to a lot of recent staff turnover, I'm now one of the most experienced members of my work team. I've not been there that long myself. I still don't know what I'm doing"
"My mum only phones me when she's drunk. She phoned late one night and said 'I'm wearing stockings and suspenders'. I said 'Mum, is that you?'. She then said sorry, she thought it was her brother. My birth certificate says 'Father Unknown'. I fear I might be my own cousin."
"When I clean the kitchen, I draw stupid things with the furniture polish spray on cupboard doors like I am a budget banksy. The other day I forgot to wipe one of the doors and hosted family and friends with a giant cock and balls illuminated on my cupboard door."
"At uni I suspected one housemate of repeatedly stealing my Ribena, so I snuck into her room and sure enough I found my bottle in there. I pissed into it, shook it up, and left it there. Found it was half drunk days later. Take that, Natalie."
"Spent tens of thousands moving to the NE of England as when I came up here on hols the girls were nice to me, moved up thinking I would beating them away, turns out the northerners are just more friendly and no more likely to sleep with me, at least it is only £3 a pint"
"I've lost count of the number of times I've had to discretely urinate into a mug or glass during a long Zoom meeting. It was risky at first, now it's just standard procedure - confession sponsored by Fairy Liquid."
"I was staying at a friend's house and decided to have a wank in bed one evening. But there was no bin to put the tissue in, so I left it on the floor. The next day my friend opens the door & lets his dog run in, but before I can do anything the dog jumps on the tissue & eats it."
"When we were kids my brother sort me with an air rifle. From a distance, so it didn't really hurt that badly. But I forced out tears and threatened to tell our parents unless he gave me a 'free shot'. Point blank in the kneecap."
"When buying drugs at Uni I noticed the dealers security was less than ideal. He was a dick. I planned an operation and went back when I knew said dealer and housemates were all at a drum and bass night and robbed all his cash, pills and weed. Scott free."
"For no discernible reason, I told a my parents that my primary school teacher stole my dog. They thought it was a code for assault and that I was too emotionally scared to tell the whole story. The teacher was investigated and moved school at the end of term. I'm still mortified."
"I love picking my nose, but I'd learned not do it around other people. Working from home has destroyed a life time of learned behaviour and I'm dreading going back to the office. At least there will be plenty of hand sanitiser."
"In August 1996, I was in a busy pub in Central London struggling to get served, Chris Tarrant was in there with a group of people, he helped out by attracting the bar staff attention for me, I put two pints on his tab, still feel guilty now."
As a teen I climbed out my b'room window onto the roof to secretly smoke. One time in the night I fell through the roof. I climbed back inside and told my parents I heard someone outside trying to break in. To this day they don't know the truth.
"A girl I went to school with posted about becoming a grandmother and how it's made her feel old. Problem is, we were in the same year, so now I feel old too. I'm not even 40 yet, but now I have to buy a sports car and have an affair I guess."
"I own a small business, and it's my job to send out the invoices. I also really hate asking people for money - always have done - and so often leave things uninvoiced. As a result my business is nearly bankrupt."
I sell single cigarettes to school children to earn beer money.

"Taking inspiration from swarming insects, I set reminders to cut my nails and toenails at different prime-number-interval days apart so I rarely have to do both on the same day"
At school I was a goody 2 shoes. Our tutor was a power mad weasel who made us ALL stay in at break times for minor infractions. As he was in the middle of giving us another detention he walked into his cupboard and I locked him in. No-one ever told on me. Not sorry Mr Robinson.
"I'm 28, live on a street full of old people. My neighbour - Doris - is a lovely lady but is incredibly lonely & memory's gone. I write postcards/bday/Xmas cards to her from made up old people. She tells me about them over the fence with a massive smile convinced she knows them"
"It's a point of pride to me that in the 9 years of our relationship, I've never once stuck my finger in my wife's mouth when she's mid-yawn. She yawns every night just before before turning out the light and I always think about it but hold myself back."
I have sharpened screwdrivers strategically placed in every room of my house in case my ex breaks in. I haven't seen him for nearly 20 years.
I've never been anyone's best man but whenever I know the groom reasonably well I always write my own speech just in case anything happens to the best man. In 8 weddings my speech has been loads better than the actual speech and it really annoys me.
When I was young I found my dad's stash of old grot mags and an old condom. For some inexplicable reason after completing my first 'posh wank' I proceeded to inflate the used condom like a balloon. It popped covering my face in jizz. I've never spoken of this until now.
At school we had a PaperAirplane comp where the longest throw won. I missed my go and as everyone left the hall I told the teacher I hadn't had my turn. Subsequently the winner had have a 1:1 against me where I won! He had to give me his prize and my Dad was gleeful his plane won
Fell into the trap of wondering whether I was addicted to porn. Tried to stop. Wandering the streets wondering what passing girls looked like naked. Too horny to function. Surely that's worse?
Just before the first lockdown we switched energy suppliers. Needed new meters. Then lockdown hit and in the confusion our meter swap got complicated. We have never had a bill and still have Gas and Electricity. They think we are on prepay.
"When I was in my early twenties and shagging about, during the act I would often think about really ugly footballers to help me last longer."
"When I was 18, I was having a sexual relationship with a 44 year old widow until her 20 year old daughter caught us in bed together. I'm still not sure who was the most embarrassed."
"I had a temp job answering letters for a HUGE bank. On 3 occasions I drew cock and balls on a sheet of paper and inserted it into the printer used by the team, so it would appear on the back of anything printed. The letters must have went out to customers. Nothing was ever said."
"Deborah Meaden once asked me for directions, I sent her the wrong way on purpose, because I didn't like her Dragon's Den persona. Every time I see her tweeting on the right side of things on here I feel more guilty. I haven't blocked or muted her though, as I deserve it. Soz Deb."
If I ever put focus time in my work calendar I'm scheduling a wank. This makes me feel less bad about getting paid for it.
"My child is obsessed with collecting tickets from amusement arcades to exchange for crap. He's shit at the games so costs me a fortune. I've learnt if I hang about long enough and look in my purse while saying I don't have change, strangers hand over tickets as they are leaving"

Yesterday whilst my neutered dog was having sex I maintained eye contact to give him a taste of his own medicine. He stopped after about 15 seconds and went and sat in his bed sheepishly. Serves him right for the amount of times he's put me or my wife off.
I'm currently 4 weeks smoke free. It's probably too late for me to avoid some cancer or another. I just enjoy seeing how much money I am redirecting towards Star Wars Lego.
Our neighbours are arseholes and obsessed with their garden. Even leaves blown from our trees get put back over the fence. They've got those cat monitors to stop cats pooing in their garden - so when I find some in ours I lob it over the fence. They can't work it out.
I flirt with the nurses at the blood donation centre every time I go because they always give me extra biscuits afterwards.
At school aged about 14 we used to play this game where when the teacher turned around to write on the blackboard we would get our dicks out and quickly swing back in our chairs then put them away. It was an all boys school.
My 'art anatomy reference folder' is starting to look a lot like a collection of pornography.
"The only thing keeping me with my girlfriend is how much I love her dog. Fuck, I love that dog so much it would break me if I lose her as I helped raise her from day one."
"After getting shafted out of months of pay from my first job out of college, I set up a client meeting through a fake email for a Chinese clothing supplier 150 miles away. Invited the 2 guys running it and their wives to a nearby Chinese restaurant as a hospitality. It was closed"
"I once stole the Van der Graaff generator from the school's science cupboard, and hid it among the instruments in the music cupboard. It wasn't found for a year. I was 32, and the geography teacher."
"I have told my gf that I've signed up to play for a pub dart time, I haven't, I use it as a way of having a quiet drink on my own on a Tuesday night, the awkward part is when I go home and have to tell her about how the team did."
I work for a very large software company. Every time I find an interesting bug or security hole in our codebase I tell a friend who's set up as an independent security consultant. He sends it in as part of the bug bounty program and we split the reward 50/50
During the early 00's I frequently claimed to be both Dane Bowers and Daniel Beddingfield go get into clubs free and get with girls. I barely look like either and am Irish.
"My son was growing a sunflower as a cubs project. I accidentally sprayed weed killer over it and it died. 3 years later, every summer he wonders why it died. My wife and I exchange guilty looks. I don't have the heart to tell him."
"If ever I need an adrenaline hit, I send a brutally honest and unpleasant email on Googlemail to my manager, and then press the recall button just in time. I feel like a bomb defuser and it stops me falling asleep when work is slow"
"When I was 16 I did work experience for a small sports shop run by 1 guy. He treated me terribly, and made me fill out letters and seal them for 5 hours straight without a break. To get my own back, every 3 stamps I threw 1 in the bin. Must've cost him over £50"
"I started growing and shaping my nails because my university girlfriend's biggest turn on was having nails trailed down her spine. My wife doesn't give a shit about it, but I still keep them nice because the cat likes head scratches with them."

"One of the staff members at my son's preschool is an absolute goddess. However, the one time I fantasized about her, the mood was ruined when I accidentally imagined her congratulating my performance in the same way she congratulates the children on their drawings."
"I absolutely loathe being a grown up sometimes. Not the work, or the taxes, or the lack of play… it's the mundane shit you're not prepared for. Washing dishes. Mopping the floor. Shopping. Hair cuts. Cutting my nails. Makes me long for old age where someone can do it all for..."
"When I was a teacher, my manky cat often slept on student work. He was nearing 20, had abscesses and separation anxiety. He'd leave grim smudges of brown gunk all over their work. I always told students it was where I'd spilled coffee."
"Applied for my uni hardship fund; money was a bit tight. I was surprised when they granted me around £5k. I got two separate confirmations, assumed it was accidental but they sent the money twice, I put it in a savings account in case they ever asked for it back. They never did."
"At uni, I drove my car into someone's parked car, damaging its lights. Mostly due to embarrassment, I didn't own up. A couple of days later, the uni newsletter had a message from the owner asking the culprit to own up 'if they had a conscience'. I do, but I still didn't."
I bit a nail off and spat it out and it flew into my colleagues sandwich. I stood by and let him take it to the shop he brought it from arguing with them there was a nail as big as a toenail in his food.
"We have 5 toilets & I spread the love land use a different one for dump each day of the week. Family visited so my routine was out as I couldn't use the guest on-suite, consequently it is owed an extra special one and I have a hot curry planned for tonight to deliver."
"Once went to a hotel with then-girlfriend, supposedly to pick something up for her sister. Spent much time saying 'why the hell would anyone want to stay in a hotel in hospital grounds'. Got to the room, saw the balloons & realised she'd booked us the night there for my birthday"
Inside an office after 18 months. Realising I hate talking to & meeting people face to face because you cannot parallelly play scrabble as you can on Zoom or Teams
"When drunk I message celebrities on Instagram and Twitter telling them how hot they are. And twelve months later, you guessed it, never had one reply."
"Thought my elderly mum's house smelt of piss, booked a doctors appt to ensure everything was ok down there, realised on my drive home I'd put my penis away before finishing and it was actually me that smelt of piss. She saw the doctor anyway, and thankfully everything is ok."
"Bloke over the road loudly empties his cans and slams his bin lid at 6 every morning , I went out late one night and glued the lid shut on his bin and waited to watch the confusion the following morning, teach him to be quieter"
"I'm the one who grassed my former friend Mark for drink driving. Didn't know about the load of class A in his car and home, which was a bonus. He got 8 years the prick."
One of my childhood memories is using a pair of scissors to cut both the eyes off a snail. The way it recoiled back into its shell often keeps me awake at night. I'm 35 years old and this incident took place over 25 years ago. I don't think I've harmed another living thing since.
"My Mum wanted me to help her with a new laptop. When I got there it said Welcome John as she was logging on. I said, Who's John? She said, I was setting it up and it said input your name, for example John, so I put John ."
"Did lockdown quizzes with mates where we had 'bad taste' Zoom backgrounds - mine was Michael Barrymore's pool. Quizzes ended, then a few months later, had a job interview on Zoom. Forgot about the background & explained it away just as an ideal home / garden I'd like to have."

My street has 2 visitors spots. Neighbours with more than 1 car always park in them. It really winds me up for no reason as they are always moaning about it with each other. Last week I ordered skip and put it one of the spots. It's sat there empty. Happiest I've been in years.
"I love to grab a sneaky handful of wallpaper paste when there's some being used. Started eating it when I was a kid and my father was doing some decorating, yummy stuff. If my wife caught me I couldn't live with the shame."
"Got my neighbour a nice bottle of wine to thank them for feeding the cat while we were away. Got home and decided that actually it really was quite a nice bottle of wine so nipped down to coop and got them an alright one instead. In the spirit of goodwill, I bought a very fancy box of chocolates for my ex wife for her birthday. And then ate them. So I had to buy another box. Which I also ate. I didn't give her any chocolates."
Back in the days when Wi-Fi was routinely not encrypted I used to run drive by investigations of random PCs. About 10% of people I looked at had extremely dodgy stuff on their PCs. If I could work out the address / name I would report them to the police anonymously.
An ex girlfriend had an incredibly hairy crack. It didn't bother me but she was self conscious about it so I agreed to shave it for her. I used my Dad's electric shaver for the job. Sorry Dad.
I've been a cycling journalist for 15+ years. I still can't spell derrailueuere properly. Derraileuer. Deraileur.
I work in a primary school. I love the job but I hate saying goodbye to year 6's every July. Breaks my heart a little bit every single time
"I worked in a call centre where the dress code was smart casual. But I wore a jacket and tie, and carried an empty briefcase, when getting into my car every morning to impress my neighbours. What an insecure dick I was."
"I lost my dad at 8 years old, and recently became a dad myself aged 30, would've been his first grandchild. When putting my baby to sleep in the moses basket I see it rocks itself, I know that its baby moving causing this but I like to think it's my dad helping out"
I've got a detailed plan for faking my own death and starting again. I don't do it because I realise I'd just end miserable there too
I never wash the bedding in the share room
I was more upset about losing my 278 day streak on duolingo than i was when my cat was hit by a car and killed
"I read somewhere that undiluted urine can kill plants, so I decided to try it out on a couple of stubborn weeds. Worked a treat, and now I'm urinating outside almost all the time to get rid of all the pest plants."
I know my husband is having an on / off affair but it's so much easier than having sex with him every night.
I'm doing a masters degree and pay for it by escorting at weekends. The best money I make is from a guy who just likes me to turn up in my gym kit and he just watches me do yoga. That's it!

I'm a full time dad and part time alcoholic. You can shoplift a fuck load of wine by putting it under a double buggy and only paying for £3 of baby snacks. I've been challenged once and acted all new-baby-sleep-deprived-innocent.
When I was young I used to eat cotton thread and a few days later it would be in my shit and sometimes I would pull it out and enjoyed the sensation of it being dragged through my colon. I'd still do it now and I'm 52.
"We had 2 guinea pigs for the kids, after a while one of them took ill, so while the kids were at school, I took him to the vet. It died there and rather than pay the vet more to dispose of it, i took it home and put it in a bag in the bin. The family all think he was cremated."
I've found a hidden room in our house that no one else knows about. I spend hours in there away from everyone. I'm 56 and a chartered surveyor.
Had to lie to hotel staff when me and my bf went on holiday. We broke the marble table top and sink in the bathroom having a rough shag and the bathroom side was smashed.Told them I fainted and fell into it and it all came away from the wall. We were upgraded to a suite.
I fancy my Postman so bad one day I just want to ride him like a horse. He's married so I don't stand a chance but I can't help thinking of the things I'd do to him each time I see him.
"My flat got burgled years ago. I went to the police station to give them a list of the items stolen, which included my mini-disc Walkman. Whilst there I put my hand in my coat pocket and found it. Never mentioned it out of embarrassment."
"Used to work as a chef and took 6 weeks off over Xmas and new year with a work-related broken wrist. I've never broken my wrist, however I have bought a cast from Amazon and staged a fall on a leaking fridge."
My wife and I have had sex in the bathroom of 36 of the approx 60 Wetherspoons in Scotland. We started actively trying to tick them off after number 3. We don't even like Wetherspoons.
"If I'm asked, I say my happiest memory is either the day I met my wife or the day my son was born. In reality, it's the memory of popping a giant spot under my armpit 20 years ago. It exploded like a something from a disaster movie."
"I've been with my partner for nearly 3 years. I genuinely cannot fault our relationship, it really feels like we're made for eachother. Little does he know he's only made me genuinely orgasm about 3 times in our entire relationship."
"Started working at Claire's this year after I lost my job at Debenhams. Can confirm we have zero training for ear piercing. If I'm advising you to go to a trained piercer, it's for a good reason. I'm absolutely sorry to all of the kids with uneven piercings."
"I've never paid for sex, but I would pay a women to watch Lost reruns with me and listen to all my theories about what the show was all about"
It's the best of @fesshole for August 2021 - our favourite anonymous public confessions as confessed by YOU. Do please share this so we keep the confessions coming in. https://t.co/tk2NrUSVHu
I look and sound like Boris Johnson. A few years ago it was quite funny. Since he's turned into a cunt it's lost it's sheen
"FROM ADMIN: We're moderatin' again. That is reading all your submissions to decide what to pump out to now 180,000(!) people. If you fancy bunging us a couple of quid for our trouble then we'd really appreciate it and probably follow you back. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"Walking 6 miles home drunk and moneyless after a night out, I once called the police and lied that a man with a knife was chasing me. They gave me the lift home I was after."
I have a special whisky I'm not opening until I complete my daughters pop up pirate in one sword. It's been 6 months.

"Lost a breast to cancer almost a decade ago now, but sometimes when I'm sat incredibly still & a draught or cold breeze catches me I can feel my phantom nipple harden."
"When I was younger I used to make my parents tea and coffee. In an attempt to better the recipe - and hopefully get recognised as a genius - I tried different techniques such as milk first, mixing tea and coffee together. One time I even tried adding lemonade. Didn't work."
My brother works for John Lewis every Xmas he proudly presents my kids with the sold out toy from the advert. We don't let our kids watch adverts they have no clue why their uncle keeps giving them stupid stuffed toys rather than Lego.
"In my early teens I had a Tardis money box, let's be clear I'm no fan of Doctor Who. However, with hormones raging I pulled the stopper out the bottom and with moisturiser made a very early and terrible fleshlight. Stuck with my hand ever since."
"Every week after 5 a side I tell my girlfriend I've pulled my groin, she always offers to give me a massage which inevitably leads to a handjob without fail - haven't pulled my groin once"
"When I was 11 my school entered a poem writing contest. I copied a poem about dogs out of my little brothers nursery rhyme book but changed one word. My poem won and was published in a book, my proud parents bought a copy in Waterstones."
I fake my GPS location so Tinder thinks I'm in a very affluent area rather than this dump. The quality of my hookups has dramatically increased and even bagged a few bored footballers wives.
I live in Reading and yesterday bought my weekend supply of booze at the supermarket. Someone's going to the festival then... said the cashier. I said I was going to not look weird.
"My 4 yr old walked into our bedroom and asked what smelled like sweeties. I said I didn't know, but I did. It was the strawberry flavoured lube I was using to lube his mum's bum hole with before he walked in and ruined the fun."
When I was 6 I stole a hardback Little Red Riding Hood from the school library. I smuggled it in the bottom of my flared trousers. My mum made me take it back. She doesn't know I threw it in the communal bins.
"I love it when I get one of those Google 'captures' and they ask me which picture contains a traffic light or a train. I know I'm being unpaid to train an AI, so I always answer incorrectly, knowing that somewhere, someday, I'm going to kill someone on a crossing somewhere."
I love watching my husband trying to reverse onto our drive - it's hilarious seeing him struggle.It's also a pretty good illustration of why I have to rub my own clit during sex.
Walking home one day I noticed a nice headboard was being left out as rubbish so I took it. Popped out two minutes later and saw that the flat was being renovated and a couple of workmen were clearly looking for the item. I kept it.
I once done a charity skydive raising over £1000 in sponsorship. On jump day somehow the person collecting the money missed me out..... My children had a brilliant Christmas that year!!
"When I was about 18 - I had a lovely girlfriend who would only have sex if I would play Side 1 of the Wish You Were Here, LP The opening 10+ mins of 'Shine on You Crazy Diamond' can take me back to every instant we were together. Magical slow foreplay. Shine on Claire."
"I used warm water when taking part in the ice bucket challenge 6 years ago, as I hate cold water being poured on me. Not even sorry."

My inner monologue always sings to me in an operatic style voice. I've never listened to opera and I can't sing. There are at least 3 harmonies on key words and it follows me everywhere. I assumed others must experience this until I mentioned it to my family.
"I once convinced a whole pub on new years eve my phone was synchronized with the atomic clock, sorry people of the red lion in 2000/2001 but you celebrated 8 seconds after the real deal"
"When I wipe my arse am lucky enough to find a seed that's made it through unscathed, I like to think it's a tiny submarine with a microscopic Dennis Quaid on board."
"During lockdown I wanted to make my weekly shopping trip to Waitrose a bit more fun, I did this by putting a couple of drops of poppers on my face mask before going in."
"Partner & me in happy open relationship for 10 yrs. we play away on same night, every 1-2 months. however 90% of the time I get a Hilton/Premier Inn and just watch crap telly in bathrobes and order room service for the evening and just pretend I've had a saucy night like he has."
I always look forward to reading the obituaries in local newspapers and on websites. However I'm always disappointed when no-one I know has died.
"My girlfriend - now wife - & I went for a romantic weekend in Paris, we had a big fight on the first night and spent the next day apart. That evening I told her I was sorry and I'd been miserable all day. Truth is I had a fantastic time seeing all the stuff I wanted to on my own."
When returning from the barbers as a child my dad said Haircut 100!
Up until very recently when watching a rerun of Top of the Pops I thought he had been counting my haircuts.
I'm addicted to lateral flow tests namely the nose swabbage. The sweet sensation of the poking and the ensuing sneeze is a legal high for me. I'm worried I might end up with a nose similar to that of a seasoned cocaine user.
"I did jury service 6 years ago. We were all pretty certain he did it, but there was no admissible evidence to pin the crime to him. Not guilty. I google the defendant's name every so often. He's lived a life of crime ever since."
"My partner thinks it's great that I'm giving a lot of my stuff to charity and making space in our house, but I'm really moving all my things to my new place ready for when I leave."
I'm in my mid 30s I'm single and live alone over the course of lockdown however I've manufactured a fake husband for work zoom calls so I seem less lonely. Sometimes I mute myself and pretend to talk to him just out of shot.
"I've had a new laptop for a couple of weeks now, and I've yet to watch any porn on it as it seems like it'll sully it somehow."
"When I'm going upstairs at home, I always imagine I'm scaling Mt Everest. I pretend to climb up each stair with my imaginary rope and fist pump when I rech the summit."
Until I was 28 I believed girls peed out their arses.
For the past 2 years when trying to get to sleep I pretend I am the manager from my FIFA save and have to battle real world scenarios. Last night we had a board meeting about the rise of the Taliban and the impact it'll have on our striker from Afghanistan's mental health

"My mother-in-law once paid for our takeaway when she was visiting, on our local app. Her card is still saved and each time we order takeaway, unbeknownst to her or my wife, she pays for it every time. I've also taken to ordering copious beers with them too. Cheers Helen!"
A number of years ago some female colleagues told me that our manager was sexually harassing them. I planted some weed in his work drawer and left a note under the door of HR. They searched his desk and found it. He was sacked.
After passing my driving test I took my parents car for a spin. I decided it would be exciting to have a wank whilst doing nearly 90mph down a back road. I look back with a sense of terror at how I might have died and been found cock in hand by the emergency services.
"When I'm making dinner for my children, I always give my son the pink plate and imagine I'm in a fly-on-the-wall documentary where food blogger Jack Monroe is nodding approvingly at my subliminal lesson in ignoring gender stereotypes."
I always wash my knob before going out for a walk in case I get chatting to someone and it ends up with fellatio. Hasn't happened yet but I live in hope.
"As a preteen, my friend and I used to search a popular game forum for usernames to a MMO. Enter the username and try and guess the security questions. Majority of the time, the answers were just 'Cat' and 'Dog'. We bought so much in game currency and never paid a dime."
"Dad was a vicar and during school holidays I had to hang around church when he had meetings. There was a big foam-filled chair in the vestibule with a hole on one corner that they had to throw out because it had gone mouldy. That'd be from all the times I fucked it. Sorry, dad."
"Years ago, I was seeing two women at the same time. In choosing which to stick with I chose the one who seemed 'more sexually adventurous'. Turns out my now wife was just trying really hard to impress, the one I dumped is now a swinger, and I've not had sex for two years."
Every time I go away on a family holiday I start counting down the days until we can go back home.
I really want to show off and tell people which @swearclock posts are mine because they always do really well but then they'd figure out how awful I am.
"Keen to impress my new lover, I bought Viagra online and popped a couple. Maybe 3. This seems to have been too many as my vision went red and I couldn't come. Had to fake it. Stinking hangover and vision fucked all afternoon."
"My girlfriend made spaghetti bolognese as it's her favourite meal. I hate it, but ate it as I didn't want to offend. Still eating it once a week and just celebrated our 30th wedding anniversary."
"Whenever I drive through a long tunnel I pretend I'm Buck Rogers in his starship by leaning back tightly on entry imagining the immense G forces upon launch, whilst making continuous loud rocket noises and then when exiting I spring forward shouting yeah!"
"As a child my Grandad told me if you eat tomato seeds a plant will grow in your belly. I'm 40 next year and know it isn't true but even now can't bring myself to eat tomatoes with seeds still in, I have to de-seed them all."
"When I didn't get an expected pay rise, I emptied the contents of my hole punch into my boss's umbrella. On the next rainy day is was a pleasure to see him open his brolley in front of the office and get showered in cheap confetti."
When I was 8 I went to a friend's house for tea. Trod in dog shit on the way there & then trod it all over their house. Friend's mom had lovely cream carpet. I'm not sorry - found out years later that friend turned out a sex offender.

"In the 90s I used to listen out for which London Underground lines were having delays, and pretend I was using that line that day in order to get my daily travelcard refunded. Claimed about £2k until they sussed me out"
"My ex and her parents fell out, so I went around to try and make the peace. I ended up shagging her mum for 3 years. My ex thought I was trying to help all that time"
"The best part of lockdowns and masks is that I got to grow out my moustache and see how luxurious it is. It's a good one. Yes, I'm a woman."
Once donated £2 to my school bully's sick kid's Just Giving page. Just so I could tell everyone how big of a cunt he was in the comments section.
"Decided to see what chatrooms were like from a woman's perspective. In 5 minutes I had 8 men asking me if I was horny. This was in a gardening chatroom for fuck sake. Got one on cam and I put a plant pot over head, totally threw him. Yeah, it was an odd Tuesday that day."
"My boyfriend and I are planning on moving in together sometime in the future. I really hope he farts just as much as I do, so my gassy nature won't be an issue for him."
I was made redundant and applied for over 500 jobs in 2 years. Utterly humiliating & depressing. I have a job now and quite like it but can't stop submitting applications. Just accepted a new job I'm not even sure I want. I'm a pathetic LinkedIn addict and can't stop.
"I just killed - or tortured, I should say - 3 slugs by pouring vinegar on them. I will see them writhing in my nightmares."
"I have a beard, so when I get out of the shower I put my towel on my head and say Jesus stuff into the mirror. I think I make a convincing Messiah. Then I use the towel to dry my balls and ass crack."
Our home WiFi is utterly and completely shocking because my Dad is a cheap skate. So my collection of offline filth grew to be the largest folder on my laptop. Don't have the heart to filter through all of it so just bought an external disk to offload it. Don't get TalkTalk WiFi.
"After a dozen years of marriage during which oral was never an option, my wife has suddenly discovered a real enthusiasm and talent for blowjobs. It's great but I can't help but wonder where the initiative and the expertise have come from."
"Convinced my wife that previous girlfriends LOVED it when I rested my balls on their forehead, it took a couple of years of trust building and subtle suggestions before she agreed to it. Absolute nonsense for my amusement of course."
"Every time I use the waste disposal I imagine it's the Sarlacc pit scene from Return of the Jedi and if the food isn't going down I imagine it screaming 'no, no, nooooo' as I push it in"
"I've always felt like the black sheep of the family and today I found out that my mother, step father, brother and sister have a family group chat without me. I'm not even sad, just reaffirms the fact that my life is less hassle without them in it."
"Both my siblings have kids. I think I prefer my brother's kids, they are less chaotic, messy. My sister's kids always run rampant and have no boundaries. As a spinster uncle, it'll be my brother's kids I'll leave more to."
My best mate killed himself during lockdown. I did the porn buddy thing. Sneaking his fleshlights & electric butt plugs out of his house under the noses of his grieving parents and taking them to the tip was simultaneously the saddest and funniest thing I've ever had to do.

When I was 14 I stole the badge from a Mercedes. To this day I still worry about the impact my actions might have had on the life of the car owner.
"I worked for a company that manages YouTube accounts and if you entered a competition to win a signed copy of a household name comedian's new book during that time, there's a good chance I forged it by googling their autograph as they often weren't available to do it"
"I have been buying things for cash for years, leave, put the item in my car, then go back to the shop, pick up the same item, and return it with my receipt saying I'd made a mistake buying it. Shop gives you your money back. Got the item for free."
I once invented a full family to the cashier in Asda because she made a comment about the big tray of donuts that obviously had to be for the kids. I'm a single 30 year old man
My brother goes on about being shit-hot at Scrabble and plays on the app. I've set up a fake account and slaughter him by cheating with a Scrabble solver website. He has no idea and is utterly raging but keeps replaying. Might let him win once. maybe.
"In the 90's my friends played with a ouija board. Living opposite I could see them through the living room window. I thought it would be funny to ring them and play Smart E's Sesame's Treet backwards down the phone on the record player. They were terrified, it was great."
"I saw some kids lose their football under my car. As one reached under to retrive it I turned my car alarm on and off which made the car beep loudly. Kid under my car banged his head really hard. Sorry, if that was you playing football in Selly Oak. Would do it again, though."
"Aged 20 I traveled around India for 3 months. My credit card was ripped off. Among other things, they spent £500 on William Hill. I cancelled the card, but came back to &gt;£6000 credit as one of the bets had won. Paid for the whole trip! Credit card company never questioned it."
After a very close family friend died recently I volunteered to help sort out his things to make life easier for his wife and parents. Found some horrendous things on his computer but now they hate me for shopping him to the police because I've ruined their memories.
"My wife regularly has a large and difficult jigsaw on the go. When she goes to bed I'll solve 3 pieces then strategically return those to the pile. Next day, when she seems particularly stuck, I walk by nonchalantly solving those pieces. She hates it but it's like a drug for me"
"I have moved house since my wife died, but I brought a load of her stuff when I moved. Clothes, even make-up and hair things. I dread the day I'm going to have to explain it to somebody, but I dread even more having to throw any of it away."
"This morning my wife told me she dreamt about giving me a hand job. This afternoon she said she'd like to give me a blowjob. Seriously Emily, what the fuck am I supposed to do with this information when we both know that by the end of the day you'll be too tired to do either."
"I was propositioned to be in a gay porno aged 15 at Piccadilly circus station when I was on my way to see a musical that my brother worked on, I politely refused but it was his genuine disappointment as he said You only have to be sucked off that I'll always remember."
I once walked dog shit through our entire office before I realised I had shit on my shoe. It had got everywhere and really stank. When I realised I discreetly cleaned my shoe off and blamed one of the grad students. No regrets.
"My mum died a few years ago, she was in her early fifties. Now if I hear of someone dying who was older than she was, I feel jealous and always think 'why did they make it to that age but my mum didn't?' I feel instantly awful but can't help it. I miss my mum"
"My new job is fucking weird, I'm actually working for a troll farm. I get paid to be a cunt online. Slightly worried about the effect it will have on my mental health but it IS work from home."

Once while eating some toast I got too happy and ate it way too quick and ended up throwing up all over my boyfriends work shoes.
As a student I was approched by a man to kick him in the balls for £50. It was gross but I got some new shoes though.
"One evening when I was 14 a friend and I found a hedgehog crossing the road. We were already in a giddy mood and so proceeded to bark at the hedgehog, which instinctively froze on the spot. Seconds later a car approached and flattened the poor thing. It's haunted me ever since."
"I drive 40 miles to work every morning, still drunk from the night before and probably more wasted than most people still drinking at midnight. I only get away with it because I have my own office and my job is basically meaningless so no-one knows that I do no work before 3pm."
I was once at a school event with Bernie Winters and Snorbitz the dog. I spent most of that time under a table feeding the dog cake. 2 days later Snorbitz died. Sorry Bernie!
I once got a part time job at a supermarket purely because I printed out my CV instead of scrawling it on a notepad like the other losers.
"I generally order two McDonald's breakfast meals, one with a coffee and for the other I say: ... I think she said she wanted an orange juice... They're both for me."
"Twenty years ago when I was a girl of 16, my nice 50 y/o next-door neighbour lost his wife & daughter in a crash. He was devastated. We got close & I slept with him a few times to make him happy again. He died last month & left me £150,000. My husband is very puzzled why."
For years I have missed calls on my phone because I can never hear them. Just realised that I always turn the volume down when looking at porn on Twitter.
"I spend hours every month trying to find different TV shows to watch that my wife will probably like, and I'll just about be able to tolerate. If I don't do this, the final thread holding our marriage together will finally snap."
"I hacked our work timesheet system, and made a script that automatically fills in the whole offices timesheets each week with random assignment of time to real jobs or even to made up jobs. It also earns us a bit of overtime now and then."
"I 100% believe that animals suffer when raised and killed for food, and that eating meat is bad for the planet. But every fortnight I roast a whole chicken and eat it in one go in a desperate fugue."
My partner went away with the dog this weekend. I really missed the dog.
"Arranged a hook up type 'date' with a woman from Tinder. On the morning of the date I realised I really wasn't in the mood, so I pretended that I've got a girlfriend. Couldn't bring myself to think of another excuse. She cancelled. Relieved."

"I told my wife that I am allergic to grass. She has cut our lawns for the last 21 years. I am not allergic to grass, I just hate mowing."
My mother in law has a lovely decorative soap with a cherubs face. I thoroughly enjoy washing my bum with it.

"From age 18-26 my bra size was 34A. As I got older and put on a bit of weight, I never noticed that my tits were also growing. My bras got so uncomfy I didn't wear them for four years. I finally realised that my tits are now 36D. Wearing a bra that fits feels incredible!"
I consider myself reasonably eco conscious but I burn extra petrol in my car just because the Sport Mode dashboard accent colouring looks wayyy cooler in red than it does in the blue or green.
There's a customer at work that is horrible. Even his wife hates him.He had one small saving grace; He is extremely punctual in responding to emails with rude phonecalls.I now email him 5 minutes before lunch safe in the knowledge that someone else will deal with him.
I used to work as a barista and if anyone ever moaned that their drink was too cold for them I would make a new one with scolding hot milk as payback. Half the time it was so hot they didn't finish the new coffee. Jokes on them for complaining
"When I check my phone whilst having a shit, if I have a message from the other half and we're both in at the time, I put my phone on aeroplane mode to read it so she doesn't see I check messages whilst on the toilet. Switch it off and reply once I'm back at my desk."
"45 Years old, child of the 80's. I've only just realized the only winning move is not to play, from the end of Wargames isn't just referring to Tic Tac Toe, but actual nuclear warfare."
"Recently Giles Coren was all over Twitter due to his car being stolen again, falling out with Ash Sarkar and mocking the recent death of journalist Dawn Foster. I got confused and thought it was Gyles Brandreth. Sorry for thinking less of you Gyles."
"I thought Rufus - as in 'and Chaka Khan' - was a single bloke, not her band. I'm an idiot."
"I reversed into a neighbour's car, denting it, but with no visible damage to my car. It was during an England match in the Euros so nobody was around to witness it. I just parked further down the street."
I auditioned to play Hermione in Harry Potter. I often wonder what my life would have been like had I got the role and not Emma Watson.
"When I was 12 and she was 4, my little cousin thought that each coin was worth the same amount. She thought the more coins you had, the richer you were. I managed to get a £2 coin from her in exchange for four 5ps, a 10p and a 20p."
As an on-call gynaecologist I saw a young woman. She was high on speed. She'd been out clubbing and had stashed her money in her vagina 'as I had no pockets'. On speculum exam I saw the Queen's face on a £5 note staring back. I gave it back to her. So it's back in circulation.
"I came out as bi to my wife. Now all she does is quiz me about what men I fancy, and then judging my poor taste."
"I lost part of my foot in a car accident, and to be honest, I'm more annoyed that the hospital didn't let me keep the bones than I am with the drunk driver who hit me."
I don't want to marry because I feel ashamed I don't have enough friends and family to attend the ceremony.
"Many years ago when doing the local pub crawl we used to see the same bloke in a scabby brown leather jacket every week. One week I nicked his jacket from the coat hook and threw it in a bush outside the pub, never to be seen again."
I still maintain I did him a favour.

I cut my dads hair and he always insists on a number 3. He's 70 and couldn't tell the difference so I do a number 1 every time so I don't have to cut it as often.
"Many years ago when my mum was in intensive care, I had a one-night stand with a bird. We shagged in my mum's bed. Luckily, my mum recovered, but I can never tell her this."
"Once while drunk, I climbed out of a toilet cubicle after using it in a bar instead of using the door and thought it was hilarious. When sober the next day I remembered and realised all it did was inconvenience the people who wanted to use it after me and the poor bar staff. Soz."
I used to work in a railway station whilst at the same time playing for the darts team in the pub across the road. I'd often have to stop mid game when a train came in to go over and take some tickets.
I've broken my arm so many times one is slightly shorter than the other. It comes up from time to time that it's impossible to lick your own elbow. I 'unknowingly' bet the price of a drink I can and win every time.
"Despite 30+ years of reading music mags, positioning myself as being well into alternative music, etc etc, I still don't really know the difference between Talk Talk and The The."
"Used free Web text messaging 15 yrs ago to send 100s of free texts in bulk to friends with old phones that could only store 25 or 50 texts, took them hours every time to delete the incoming texts and get phone back to normal"
"As a 38 year old virgin, I feel the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin hanging over my head like a sword of damocles, feeling more and more hopeless the closer I get to that age."
Every day I throw a raisin across my office at the head of a woman I barely know. She has no idea who is doing it but her confusion brings me a little bit of joy every day.
I once had to tell a partner I was gay to get out of the relationship because every other time I tried to end things it wasn't accepted because it was something we could work out together
"My mother, while alive, was a relentless bigot. When she died I found out she'd cut me out the will and left half her money to the RNLI. Makes me smile to think her money is now helping to rescue asylum seekers in the Channel"
I work from home from my bedroom upstairs whilst my children are downstairs. Most days it sounds like they're trying to murder each other. Most days I hope they succeed.
A school friend was rumoured to have got an erection in the shower after PE. We called him 'Bonk on' until we all left school
"When I'm feeling low, I leave myself a voicemail. Yes, I actually ring my own number and tell myself not to be upset, how awesome I am, things will be all right etc. It's so comforting to play it back."
When I was about 12 years old I used to pretend I was part of the Star Trek crew while I was on the toilet. The bathroom tiles were console buttons & the wall over the bath was a Comms screen. I'm now 48 years old. I can't take a shit without pretending I'm in space.
"I pulled onto my 1st ever girlfriend's drive for Sunday dinner. Stayed a few hours and left to drive home. As I reversed I realised I'd pinned her cat under my front wheel. Stiff as a board, I hope it died quickly. My girlfriend is now my wife, still doesn't know and often tal..."

Whether I am staying in a £25 a night B&B in Blackpool or a £150 a night room in London I'll leave checking out until the last minute as if I need every last second to have value for money.
My ex wife thinks I agreed to name our daughter Alice after Alice in Wonderland. Secretly I named her after the killer Alice Morgan from the TV show Luther.
Whenever I set a timer on my phone I try to stop it on 0:07 and imagine I'm James Bond defusing a bomb.
I have a notepad and pen in my bathroom because every single one of my best ideas have come while taking a dump.
"My husband's garden is his pride and joy. It's nice but he spends all his time on it, watching gardening shows and it pisses me off. I got roped in to help, so randomly started 'weeding' the plants. He's stopped asking me to help now."
"I'm a 35 year old guy. Consider myself reasonably healthy and strong, and can bench a decent amount. I cannot open the caps on Lucozade Sport without a towel."
"When I was around 9 or 10, I wondered what it would feel like to shit my pants. So I took a massive shit in my pants. It felt weird."
"After mum died I helped my dad sort out her things. I found a box of love letters that revealed she had been having a lengthy affair with one of dad's friends. They went in the recycling, and he will never find out. The grief nearly killed him, so I won't make it worse."
"I'm 37. Instead of regretting that I can't wake up age 18 again, I pretend to myself that I'm 90 and I've woken up age 37 again, and that I get to magically, wonderfully have the next 50 years again."
"When I was a teenager I came home from the pub pleasured myself, wiped up and fell asleep. Woke up late for work, got dressed and ran for the train. Sat down and realised I'd put the T-shirt I'd wiped my cum up with. Unmistakable splash marks. Mortified."
"I love cooking and have more cook books than the Cooking section of Waterstones but I've never, EVER, followed a recipe from start to finish. I always 'improve' them because I know best. 80 per cent of the time I ruin whatever it is I'm trying to cook."
"I love my husband but, when he gets home from work, he does this almost ceremonial removal of his boots if he thinks he's not going out again. He'll then moan and point at his feet if I ask him to go outside for anything. I love him dearly but it makes me want to thump him."
"When I commute to work, I like to pick my personal sex harem from passers by. I must reach 10 people by the time I get to office. If I'm 1 or 2 short by the time I reach work, then I have to choose the next 1 or 2 people I see regardless of sex or attractiveness. Huge fun."
"Lemon tea tastes like lemon, peppermint tea tastes like peppermint. I was devastated when English Breakfast tea didn't taste like a full English. I'm 33."
"Back in the day before digital cameras were a thing, if stopped and asked to take a photo of someone, I'd always move the camera so that only one half of the couple was right in left hand corner of photo. Teeny bit of amusement for the day."
Our family GP's kids have joined our boys' footie team. Me & husband have giggled endlessly at the thought of him being like Seen his arse. Her Fanny. His dick when he sees us parents. Mainly bc on day 1 my husbands' reaction on first spotting him was OMG! He's seen my anus

My son loved monster trucks when he was three. The trouble was the way he pronounced truck sounded a lot like cock. This culminatined in him telling a passer-by he was going to Cock Fest to see a Monster Cock.
"My balls are huge, like two elongated snooker balls. This means I come loads. The downside is that if I don't wank regularly I'm pretty much fit to bursting all the time. It's exhausting… and sometimes embarrassing during sex."
Bloke managed to hit me in the leg twice at the supermarket without apology.
When he wasn't looking I silently wheeled his trolley to the other side of the building and plonked it in one of the lockable trolley slots near the cafe. I still have the key two years later.
"Whilst working as a baggage handler I often ventured into the terminal to get my lunch and people would always ask for directions. The nice ones were directed straight to where they needed to be, the rude ones would be directed in the complete opposite direction."
Been in a caravan for two weeks with the family. Can't wait to get home and have a wank capable of blasting through the upper atmosphere.
When I was a kid and there was poo in the toilet and I was peeing I used to like to pretend I was a Ghostbuster busting the slime. I used to whistle the tune. I'm 35 and still do it.
As a student enjoyed fishing. Forgot about a bait box which had spilled open. A few days later came back to the flat after working late to find the kitchen strip light covered in flies. Spent 4hrs killing them. At the newsagent at 6am to buy fly spray. Flat mates never found out.
I ended a friendship after they hosted a dinner party in which all the ceiling lights were left on full blaze and the music came from a huge wall-mounted TV with the screen on. Still don't regret it. Psychopaths
"Whenever I buy something off of someone online, I tell them that I'm twice as far away as I actually am, and ask to meet in the middle. It's always at a park that's actually five minutes from my house."
I've just been ghosted after a 6 month relationship. Would it be going too far to drive to his work and punch him in the face?
"Cloned my ex-gfs iPhone to get access to her whatsapp in a fit of jealousy, did not find anything - but still shudder thinking about this as today, you can go to jail for this intrusion"
I pick the dry skin off my feet and let my dog eat it. She now spends a lot of time looking at my naked feet and I'm worried I've started something that will come back to haunt me.
Even thought I have a well paid job. I steal beer glasses from pubs. As beer tastes better in pub glasses.
I once replaced all the covers of my complete Inspector Morse VHS collection with photoshopped porno covers and sold them for fiver each at a car boot sale. Sorry I ruined your wanks with classic cosy crime.
"Often use I don't negotiate with terrorists with my kid. Whilst ordering ice cream in a theme park, kid being cute and cheeky wanted 2 flavours, nice lady with hijab said he's got you round his little finger and used my standard line... only realised a minute later, Mortified"
"Years ago, my local Woolworths had a music & games section and a Post Office within the store. I'd lift PlayStation games, pop them in an envelope and post them to myself from the Post Office. 2 days later, the free games would arrive at my door."

"I had a paper round in my early teens, but didn't collect the payment so received no tips. The shop owner's son got to do that. In retaliation, I would remove random pages each morning, knowing that he would incur the wrath of the customers at the end of the week."
Whoever I cut my toenails I always save the pinky toe for myself to chew on later. Lovely.
My wife is such a wine snob and always insists on the dearest bottles but what she doesn't realise is that I've been filling the same posh empty bottles with the 4 quid stuff from Aldi for about 6 months.
My penis is starting to become quite hairy. I'm scared to shave it but I need to do it soon. It's looking a bit like one of Chewbacca's fingers.
"When I was a teenager, I ruined a pan and chipped a tooth making fried rice. I didn't know the rice had to be cooked first. It burnt to the pan, and when I tasted it the rice was rock hard."
"I lied on my CV, got the job and had to pay freelancers from Upwork to do jobs for me for a few months while I learnt the things I said I could do."
People will think I'm being silly but I'm quietly really sad about Sean Lock dying. He & his pals on the panel shows always make me laugh & have always been there during some very lonely stages in my life. It's like a friend & one of the gang has died but I didn't even know him.
Every night I successfully moonwalk out of the socks I have been wearing all day. In my head I always finish off with a it off with a Jacko style HEE-hee so as not to wake the missus.
"35 years ago I was a paperboy. One morning, around 6:30am, a naked woman opened the curtains in an upstairs bedroom window. Sadly this was never repeated. To this day I know exactly which window it was and I cannot pass that house without staring, just in case."
"My sister & I stayed by my dieing dad's hospital bed for three days, my sister needed to get shower & change of clothes. I was hungry I went to the canteen ate a bacon butty. I got back & dad was dead. Sister arrived back hysterical: were you holding his hand? Me: erm, yes."
My mum is dying with dementia. It's slow and excruciating to watch and she's barely existing anymore. I've grieved her loss for years already and wish we could end this for her and for us.
"I use Google maps a lot and even if there's the slightest bit of traffic, I give the most miserable face when asked to rate my journey, even if the traffic was published in the original route."
Take that Google.
"Working at the till, I used to short change customers at McDonald's and pocket it at the end of the day. My till was never down but sorry to the people who were always £1 down :/"
"When my aged mother in law dies I hope she goes in a house fire or gas explosion. I don't want to inherit any of her hideous furniture, ornaments and assorted junk."
My cat likes to smell my hand before I stroke her so I hold my hand out like she is a supplicant and I am The Pope offering my ring to be kissed. It makes me feel incredibly powerful.
I was well into my 20s before I started chewing peas when I ate them. Previously I swallowed them whole; the idea of chewing them disgusted me utterly.

Got a £120 fine for leaving my car at a shopping centre all day while I was at work. Edited the HTML on an old ticket email from the cinema to make out like I was there when they printed the ticket. Full refund and compo. Done this loads of times since and never been caught.
In meetings my manager liberally uses corny 80s phrases. It's done beautifully and I'm sure it's deliberate. When they managed to weave singing a verse from Tracy Chapman's Fast Car into a meeting I started to fall in love. I'd leave my partner for them. No question.
"Whenever I see an older person out jogging, I always want to dress up as Death and trot along behind them with a scythe."
"I often suggest to my wife that we should move to a country on the Med where it's warmer. However I also think about this because I'd quite like to have a bidet, they're much more common there. I'm middle aged and have trouble cleaning my bum properly."
"I'm normally a vegan teetotaller, but when my wife goes away for work I order a massive meaty pizza and smash 8 cans of high strength IPA in an evening and then dump the evidence in the bins at work the next day. I'm hanging out of my arse today but it was still worth it."
Every year for my birthday when blowing out the candles I secretly wish that in my lifetime I get to see a revolution that guilotines the rich and the state takes their assets. I tell my family that I wish for my football team to win that week
My sister went on a French exchange and asked me to look after her mice. I forgot to feed them and they ate each other. It was grim.
"As a teenager, I worked on Tesco's refrigerated aisle. All the products were sealed, other than the squirty cream, so whenever alone in the cold storeroom, I'd pop the lid off a can and spray myself a mouthful before getting on with my day."
I follow the local police force on social media in the hope that one day I'll recognise someone in the grainy cctv pictures they publish that they 'want to speak to' so I can shop them.
"To test the properties of a food storage container, I farted into it and quickly sealed the lid. Over 3 hours later I was able to confirm that the container was indeed air tight. My fart was still rancid."
"One morning my girlfriend's dad knocked on our front door while I was naked after sex. I quickly pulled on jeans and T-shirt. As we spoke on the doorstep the used condom slipped off and fell down my jeans leg and onto my foot. He looked at it, looked away, and never said a thing."
"Before heading for a Tinder date, I took a pre-date shit at work. Shit was rather violent and hit the back of the bowl and up, covering my white shirt with shit splatter. Did my best to clean it, but still went on the date. Didn't work out."
My grandmother gave me £500 and I spent it all on high-end sex toys. 
"It was a total waste of money as everytime I try to get off, her face appears, and all desire evaporates"
"When I was about 30, the kid who had bullied me horribly all through secondary school died. I found the details of his funeral on Facebook, so I went and loved every second"
"I check up on my ex's social media every so often. Not because I particularly care what he's up to, I just want to make sure he's still not doing any better than me"
In a zoom meeting I recorded a short 30 seconds of myself then replayed that back as a looped video. I felt like I was in Speed.

"Whenever my family try to offer me any sweets or chocolate I say I don't like them, so that when half go missing later I'm not a suspect"
"When living with friends, I started sticking tiny stickers of dogs in random places in our flat; one or two at a time and then a few days later a couple more, over a period of weeks. Eventually everyone wondered why there were dogs everywhere; I denied all knowledge."
"Wife suggested I shave my chest, pubes and balls as she'd find me more shaggable. She didn't, and now all I'm left with are itchy ingrown hair whiteheads down under."
"A friend of mine works for a tractor manufacturer. Whenever I drive past a tractor made by a different company, I boo it. I am a 48-year-old professional male."
I'm a grade 8 clarinettist and have played in concert halls all over Europe but this morning I did three consecutive farts to the exact tune and rhythm of the opening of Thin Lizzy's Whisky in the Jar and it's my greatest ever musical achievement.
"Whenever I've been at an international airport over the past 40yrs, I've stood at the departure boards, & said New York, London, Paris, Munich, everybody talk about Mmm Pop Music. Last week, a smartly dressed man replied Shoobie doobie do wop. Mission accomplished."
I just instigated an bit of an argument with my missus so I could sit around at home on my phone undisturbed.
"Handing the keys to the estate agent for viewings on our home, without thinking I said now don't come in and have sex in our bed."
My wife buys packs of small pork pies every week as she thinks I love them. I'm at best indifferent and on the day they are going out of date I glumly eat them but hate to tell her. We've been married over 20 years.
"I end up crying whenever I watch Mortimer & Whitehouse gone fishing. It perfectly captures middle age, their friendship is truly "
"touching, and is something I've never had. Breaks my heart every time."
"I've a large old tree in the backyard, when its windy it creaks a lot, I like to pretend there's Predator in it"
I grow my finger nails and bite them off to use as emergency toothpicks. Les Dennis also does this as admitted on WILTY. Once he read it out on the show I felt so much better about my self. My wife gets livid as I keep them in my pockets and they fall out in the washing machine.
2010. Took out 30k loan from bank and maxed out four current and two new credit cards. Went backpacking for best two years of my life. On my return agreed to pay back approx £50 a month. Result.
"Since my divorce I've been going to a swingers club. They give us clear plastic bags for our clothes. I don't get many plastic bags these days, so they're handy for my kids' wet swimming gear, or for their stuff when they go back to their Mum's."
"With girlfriends, I'd regularly picture other women in order to climax during sex... until I met my wife. Now I picture her even when I'm having a wank. That's love kids."
My girlfriend is a foot smaller than me and when she opens the blinds in our house she only ever opens them to the level she can see at so each morning I am greeted with an eyeful of fabric as I look into the garden. It is driving me insane

"Got a tracker mortgage 6 months before the 2008 crash, 0.4% above Bank of England base rate for 24 months, bank set it to 24 years by mistake. Saved a fortune and mortgage paid off. Not sorry."
Since returning to the office we still have to wear a mask in all communal areas including going to and from the toilets. Have got into the habit of keeping my mask on when taking a shit so I don't have to smell the stench. I will definitely continue using my mask.
"I used to work in a smallish bookstore, every now and then, when I was bored I'd sign autobiographies and put them out on the shelf, and watch as customers thought they'd hit the jackpot. I even had staff members buy my 'special editions' as well."
"I have much more love for my brother-in-law than for my sister, I see him as the brother I never had. I'm always gutted when she comes to family events and he doesn't."
The wife is going away this weekend and I am going to throw out ABSOLUTELY LOADS of stuff from the attic and the freezer. I have a tenner that says she'll never notice.

I was relieved to take my husband's name and change cities when we got married. It meant I was no longer contactable by my previous-life associates and my serious criminal activities. My husband has no idea who he really married and I'll never tell him. I've changed.
"I pretend I'm in the know for horse racing, give people tips and let them bet on them. Honestly, I haven't a clue but people seem to listen"
"When hungover, as I tidy the mess of empty cans, glasses etc., I pretend I'm in a live action version of Jet Set Willy. I hum the tune and make a satisfying ping sound whenever I pick up an object. Girlfriend blocks the bedroom and flatmates obligingly walk in repeating patterns."
"Had an affair for two and a bit years. Only bothered for the free pies he used to bring me. I miss the pies but not him, turns out he was a massive cunt."
I'm a man who has started having mild incontinence issues. I buy the women's pads so the checkout people don't think it's for me.
"Ordered a computer from dell on finance back in 2003. Finance docs came through for significantly less - signed, returned and received my brand new computer. Got an email weeks later asking me to sign some updated documents for the correct amount. Ignored it. Never paid a penny!"
"I'm the singer/guitarist in a popular punk band. When I'm on tour and not on stage, I mostly read about medieval history and miss my girlfriend and our cats. I'm probably quite boring"
"When I buy wine at the supermarket I scan the cheapest bottle 6 times and put everything else through as that. No one checks, the wine all weighs the same. Had some cracking £20 bottles for £4.99."
"When I worked as a radio presenter, I'd often get offered prizes by PR companies to give away on air. Anything decent I kept for myself and sent the provider a faked recording of me announcing a lucky winner."
"I cycle a minimum of 20 miles a week, go to the gym at least 5 times a week however I'm too lazy to go upstairs to use the toilet opting to piss in a cup, chuck it down the kitchen sink accompanied by 10 blasts of spray bleach"

When prompted I always change my work password to one based on the last movie I saw in the cinema so I make sure I never watch anything with an annoyingly long title.
"During the first lockdown last year, I hid in the staff toilets because I was too shy to go and ask a manager what they wanted me to do - my department was closed. I did this for at least a month and no one ever questioned me."
"Found out my husband had arranged a date on a dating app so I set up an email acct with a blurb about unmasking catfishers & frauds & messaged the woman saying he was married, had kids & was using a fake name. He came home really pissed off the day of the date...I wonder why?!"
"I'm an Accountant, every Christmas we have a vote for the client who's been the biggest prick of the year, then I report them to HMRC regardless of if they have done anything wrong, invariably they get a full audit, we get more work it's a win win."
"I press my arse up against the patio doors and fart, trying to make it steam up. Hasn't worked yet."
"I have a spider living in the wing mirror of my car, every morning I'd remove the web it'd created in frustration, only to find the next day it's been completely rebuilt, overtime my frustration has softened, I admire its dedication, I now leave it alone to live in peace"
"Worked at a hotel in Leeds. They used to collect half bottles of wine from tables after banquet functions, combine into full bottles and resell. Stock was always up due to this so I skimmed the till to balance the universe."
"Husband snores and won't accept it because he can't hear it, so when he starts I pick my nose and drop bogies into his mouth. My best friend says if it was the other way around it would be abuse. Maybe, but it makes me smile and it's more satisfying and cheaper than divorce."
"Was home alone as a horny teenager, went to get the Vaseline for a nice slippery wank, but found out very quickly that Vaso and Vicks Vaporub have almost identical tubs. The burning lasted hours"
I pretend to my wife I'm staying up late playing World of Warcraft just so I can have a drink and read my book in peace and quiet.
"I live next to a train line. When I'm wanking, the parps from the train horns put me off my stroke because it makes me feel like I'm in a Carry On film."
"My boyfriend loves it when I gently cup and hold his balls as we fall asleep every night. It strangely helps my fall asleep too, and I get secretly frustrated when he decides to fall asleep in a way that I can't reach them."
When my mum dies I'm going to have her cremated against her wishes.
"A colleague I dislike regularly moans that we can hear a busker playing from our office. In fairness, the busker is terrible but I make sure to tip him handsomely so that he continues to play in the same spot. Fuck you Greg."
At a wedding I went for a sit down wee and got piss all over my tie. My father in law wore it round his head later in the night thinking he was funny on the dance floor
"I spy on my neighbours using my ring doorbell and deliberately wait until they are inside before going to put the bins out or go out, I don't want to have to have that awful small talk and act like I care about their cat, dog or children"

"I have a hot composter. Whenever I throw in a mix of veg, teabags, coffee granuals and banana skins I pretend I am Doc from Back to the Future refueling the DeLorean and that my composter is Mr Fusion."
"I have no idea what the settings on my tumble dryer are, and little desire to find out. I just twiddle the dial clockwise to a random point, bung the clothes in and hope for the best."
"To cheer myself up in meetings, I come up with ways I could get away with murdering my colleagues"
"When I was a horny, hyperchondriac, pubescent I found a porn mag in a bin on my paper round. I took it how and enjoyed a few exciting tugs then became paranoid I may have caught an STI from the mag and decided to contact the radio 1 Sunday surgery for much needed support."
"I hereby fess up to altering a directional road sign for Shilbottle on the A1 in Northumberland, by changing the first 'l' to a 't'. It was about 14yrs ago and I still chuckle about it."

At the age of 53 i finally realised my dream of cracking one off in every country in the world. And then Sudan went and split in two. Bastards. Fucked if I'm going there.
"A buyer on eBay, won my auction 3 times and didn't pay, or reply to any messages. As I had his address, I sent a box of large and heavy pebbles, in a package thin enough to go in the postbox. Of course, sent with no stamps, so he'd have to pay to collect it from sorting office."
To try and look cool I put cool music on when I have a feeling someone's going to pop into the office. I'm not cool.
I'm a sex worker and have had at least 4 clients tell me they are seriously considering becoming a male escort. One even organised a photoshoot and put up ads. Of course I can't tell them that they are terrible in bed and I am eagerly awaiting my Oscar nomination.

"When my oldest son was born I was so proud and had high hopes for his future. Now he's a right wing, anti-vaxxer and my only grandchild's mother is a drug-dealer. I am ashamed of him but too British to tell him I disapprove of his life choices."
"Whenever I go to the toilet in bars/clubs I always sniff heavily and play with my nose. People in the toilet look at me thinking I'm on gear, but I'm not really. I do it just to get approval from all the other Colombian marching powder takers."
"I really fancy one of the other parents at my kid's pre-school swimming class. I want to fantasise about us having sex in one of the changing rooms at the pool but I'm unable to because I can't work out the logistics of who would look after our kids, in the fantasy."
"We made a small burn in the carpet in our rented flat and we knew our landlord was super fussy. I have a geeky past painting Warhammer miniatures, so I carefully painted the burn to match the rest of the carpet. We got our whole deposit back."
"4 years old, just taught to write. I wrote my twin brothers name in marker pen over the walls. Still remember the thrill of the perfect crime on hearing my mum say to my crying told off brother. Don't be silly, why on earth would he write your name on the walls!."
"Last night I dreamed I was being shagged up the arse by Danny Dyer, while he called me a fuckin spanner. I was laughing myself silly in the shower, but I can't tell my mates I'd never hear the end of it."
In 1984 in Carlisle a mate and I stole all the milk from our street and poured it into the open sunroof of a car. Sorry
I'm frequently called upon to attend to a spider in the house. More often than not it gets away from me but I still go through the artifice of expelling it from the house and look like a hero. I think of it as a win/win for me and the spider.
My 3 year olds new favourite film is Paddington 2. She watches it at least twice a week. I can't make it to the end without weeping. I'm a 31 year old man.
Sometimes when I go for a piss I stick a rolled up ball of toilet roll down the eye and try and fire it out like a peashooter.
I'm a fairly prolific electronic music artist and this week my dad confessed to me that he'd had sex to one of my albums.
"After I had moved away, I found out my neighbour who I thought was my best friend had been stealing from me. I came back - met up with her 17 year old son and stole his virginity. I sent her a thank you card on her birthday. I'm a 46 year old woman and don't regret a thing"
Recently discovered my young daughter loves triggering social media pile ons with mysoginistic and right wing content. She has a competition with her mates to get the biggest responses. Now if I read a mental tweet that everyone quotes for outrage I wonder if it's her.
My 22 year old son is struggling with his mental health and is very likely suffering with depression. I'm finding it hard to find the right words to help him. It's breaking my heart seeing him so low. I feel like I've failed him as his mum.

25 years ago aged 8 i woke early hours of morning & saw my cousin walking past my house. He saw me & waved. He hung himself that night. Feel guilty I didn't wake my dad up. Not told anyone
I've handed my notice in at my current job. I've given a lot of professional reasons as to why I'm leaving but the real reason is my new job is home based and I want to spend my days with the dog instead of the dickheads I currently work with.
"Im a HGV driver and went to a club, met a woman who lost her keys. I have 2 beds in my truck so said she was welcome to crash. No sex or anything, dropped her off home next morning. Got up the road and realised she had pissed eveywhere. Kettering girl you have so much salty piss."
"Had brief fling 6 years ago while wife was in hospital - ghosted girl, carried on with life. Monday, she moved in 3 doors down - panicked, shaved my long hair & cut beard into moustache as 'disguise' - now look like Begbie. Made wife cry & certain I've been clocked anyway. Fuck."
"Have told my friends that my husband is just below average downstairs and even show them pictures on my phone. The truth is, he's huge, the pics are from the internet and at least one of my friends would try to shag him if she knew the truth."
Returned from summer hols and all the boys voices in my form had dropped. Mine hadn't. To address this I thought it would be a good idea to take my mum HRT tablets. It wasn't a good idea. After 6 months I still had a high pitched voice and developed a small pair of tits.
"If you were the scummy landlord that rented houses to students in Preston in 1995, and after evicting us because we refused to pay rent cause you didn't repair the heating, and you discovered the bath had loads of holes drilled in it. It was me. You deserved it!"
"When at primary school we had competitions to see who could piss the highest in our outside toilets, whilst 'training' I accidentally pissed in my mouth, twas then that I retired from the sport we had created."
"As a kid, I folded my parents shower curtain, got scissors and cut a chain of people holding hands when it was unfolded. Mum lost it, blamed my brother. As punishment she made him go to the shop with her while she returned a Nintendo she had bought him for Xmas."
"I have a Death in Service benefit through work. My wife keeps joking that she'll have to make sure I die before I retire so she'd be quids in. It upsets me, so I removed her as beneficiary, in favour of my son."
The queue to pay at my local Co-op is in the newspaper aisle. If I can get away with it I always put copies of the Guardian on top of the Mail and the Express.
My husband refers to us as 'young adults' at 30 and 31. Makes me want to kick him. He plays pokemon and drinks only Coca Cola. I have married a child.
"When using charcoal face wash I like to pretend I am an edgy metal band on a photoshoot, rather than a 50yr old man who still gets spots."
"Kept coming across ex on Tinder claiming to be 40 - he is 51.Set up fake profile as a 37 y/o, arranged a date, and watched from the carpark as he got stood up in a bar."

"I fucking love reclining. There's nothing I love more than reclining; not my wife, not my kids. If I can get a good recline going then I'm happy for hours."
"I always use a controversial public figure's name when donating to charities and whatnot. Gerry Adams made it on to the thank you page of a local community group's 2020 calendar, Harold Shipman didn't in 2021."
"I work at a country club, I'm 25 yrs younger than the average member, judging by the offers I get from lots of bored middle aged ladies their husbands should spend a lot more time practising in the bedroom rather than the driving range."
"My house was once two. It has two water connections, but only one is metered. I have not hurried to tell the water company about the other, so they don't know about more than half my water usage."
"I have no regrets I dwell on. Except one. During my clubbing days I had a house party, did too much charlie, ended up spaced out in my bedroom with the two fittest waitresses from work. They made it obvious there was an opportunity for an amazing threesome. Passed out. Idiot."
On a drunk night out I went in a graveyard with a group of friends and one started swinging on a gravestone and snapped it in half.
"In the late 90's I overheard my flatmate having sex with his girlfriend on my sofa and caught a phrase that will haunt me to my grave, don't forget the dribble towel"
"I anonymously grassed on a friend when he was illegally claiming benefits. This resulted in him missing the best lads holiday we ever had due to the fine. I still laugh to myself now, but won't tell anyone because they think he was hard done by."
"My housemates annoy me so much during lockdown that I don't want to leave my room, in case they try and start a conversation with me - to the extent that I've not showered for over a week and have been pissing in 2L milk cartons that I keep under the bed"
"At school there was a corridor by the common room where we'd do a bit of bowling, many a small man was fired at high speed into the bins on a computer chair."
"I'm a 39-year-old dad. If I say I'm tired our 4-year-old daughter brings me her 'Daddy Pig' soft toy to 'help me sleep'. Sometimes I actually cuddle it to sleep, rather than just humour her. Not sorry."
Every so often I go through all the recent earthquakes on https://t.co/1ppGdUnvaR and use their Did You Feel It? section to report that I didn't feel them from my south London house

I love watching documentaries based in rough housing estates. Not for the show but to see the locals and how they look compared to their age. Seeing someone 15 years younger than me but looking older and rougher brings joy to my middle class heart.
I was 42 years old when I found out that Michael Jackson was not singing about a Librarian Girl. Even sadder that I had to Google to find out what Liberian meant.
"My downstairs neighbour plays loud music early every morning, so sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night I deliberately drop a dumbbell on my bedroom floor just because I know it'll wake him up and ruin his sleep"
"In the London Kings Cross Underground fire of 1987, I was busking near the escalator. I had been playing for 30 mins planning to play another 30. Guy turned up asking if he could play the next slot. I'd had an OK day so gave him the pitch and went home. He died in the fire."
"I've met a super cute guy and we've been dating for two months. I want to say i love him but I'm too nervous, so when we sleeps I say I love you in hope that he doesn't hear it."
"This August marks seven years since my wife and I did anything remotely sexual together. I've tried to convince myself that the rest of our relationship makes up for the stonewall of sexlessness, and I think I have driven myself insane in the process."
I used to think Coronary heart disease was named after Sean Connery.
I crashed my company car into a bollard on a Morrison's car park because I was rifling through my handbag. I told my boss I swerved to avoid a cat. I'm still amazed that he bought that story.
"When my Gran died, I took her supply of xanax without anyone knowing. Spent the next month spaced out and chill. Good times, miss you though Nan"
"My girlfriend thinks I started getting grey pubes shortly after we first got together. The truth is that before she got to see them for the first time, I'd sat down with a pair of nail scissors and carefully trimmed them all out."
"Worked for a small high street bank in the 90s. Stole about £5k. Got found out. Lost my job, home, relationship, friends & family. 240 hrs community service. If you're going to embezzle, nick enough to make the inevitable consequences worth it."
I used to eat cotton thread as a kid. When it came to going for a shit the thread would dangle out if my arse and I would pull it out feeling it pulling through my colon. It was strangely satisfying and thought about doing it as a grown adult on more than one occasion.

A few years ago one of my best friends committed suicide. I was devastated but last week I was on a dating site and his ex girlfriend is on it .. I'm tempted to give her a message cause I fancied her but scared in case my mate haunts me from wherever he is now
"Lent my flatmate a condom and he found a strap-on in the same drawer. He wrongly assumed that me and GF use it for threesomes with other girls, and now thinks I'm a legend. Didn't even enter his head the obvious truth is she occasionally pegs me."
When I was 21 I had a hook up weekend with a man who was not just well hung but simply incredible in bed. I'm happily married now and our love life is good but I still think about that man and his size every day.
I still haven't eaten the random food I panic-bought in the first lockdown when all the supermarkets ran out of proper food. Turns out I didn't need all the pearl barley and tinned butter beans.
"During lockdown, I finally started to do something about being hugely overweight, doing all kinds of exercise and lots of it, people think it's amazing the difference it's made. But the reality is, I've just had enough and I'm just trying to have a heart attack."
My cat loves Dreamies A LOT. So I tried them to see what the fuss was all about. Not a lot going on but I felt that about Bonios and tinned Winalot. I've been trying pet food since I was 11.
Whenever I feed my dog I like to leave a trail of kibble leading to his bowl and pretend I'm Elliot and he's ET and it's the scene where he's being coaxed out of the garage
I don't like beetroot that much. But I do eat it occasionally because I'm fascinated by the magic of being able to do a giant purple shit afterwards.
"Found out today that the good friend who had an affair with my wife 20 years ago died suddenly. I'm cock-a-hoop, and I hope contrary to the funeral directors line, his death was anything but peaceful. I hope he suffered terribly, physically and mentally."
"Discovering BDSM porn at age 16 probably ruined my life. Too busy maturbating, my amazing grades dropped and from talk of Oxford I ended up in a provincial. Everything but BDSM seemed dull. Chasing those experiences has ruined two marriages. Careful what you get addicted to."
"Every time I get stomach pains, I hope it is the start of my transformation into a werewolf. So far it has mainly been trapped wind."
Now her kids and grandkids have grown up my mum got herself a couple of goldfish. I pretend to her that's she's loopy and goes over the top but secretly love the little fellas. When I feed them when she's on holiday I spend a small fortune on special food and new tank toys.
"Sometimes I'll fake a work trip to my wife and just book a cheap hotel in a UK city for two days. Nothing seedy occurs, but sometimes it's nice to do the touristy things on your own and have a pint with breakfast."
"My mum thought that 'lol' meant 'lots of love' and yes, you guessed it, wrote that in a card to her mate who had recently lost her husband"
Used to shelf stack at a supermarket and would get called to the tills during busy times. Often stuff wouldn't scan but found a button that beeped without doing anything so pressed that as I slid the item over the scanner. Gave away thousands for free £££££££
"In 2002, I found £11,000 in a sports bag hidden behind a stack of plywood in the dockyard in my hometown. After spending £3,000 of it in a matter of weeks, I panicked & bought a flight to Spain. I've been here ever since - married now, with kids - I'm still too scared to go ..."

"When house-sitting for a mate, I put a leash around the urn containing his dog's ashes and took it for a 'walk' round his garden. After I sent him the photos, it turned out I'd picked the wrong urn of the mantle piece and taken his grandad for a stroll instead. Sorry, Ken."
"At 15/16 years old, I always got nervous diarrhoea at house parties. First time I stank a house out, I pinned it on a friend as I didn't want to ruin my chances of pulling. Every subsequent party I shat at, everyone blamed him. 10 years on, people still call him the party pooper."
"Aged 5, I dug up my Nan's garden and found bones. I started to assemble them because I thought it was a Dinosaur, however it turned out to be the skeleton of the family dog that died 15 years prior."
"I got really drunk at party and walked home. I had dry shit on my bum.Turns out I fell asleep on the toilet floor at home, my parents having to force their way in and put me to bed.They never mentioned any poo or mess. I have a very vague memory of trying to shit in a pond."
"I quite enjoy reading about plane crashes on Wikipedia, the articles are always really detailed. Not sure if this is weird"
"A colleague of mine posted a picture of herself on instagram where she has clearly visible vag because of the way she's squatting. I'm a guy and I don't know her well enough to point it out so I won't say anything, but everyone can see her breakfast."
I was making tea for an annoying colleague at work. I deliberately used the same spoon to hoik out the teabag from his cup that I'd just used to stir my coffee.
"I've been meaning to clear out my sock drawer for ages; I reckon it would be about a 10 minute job. The thing is, I've been meaning to do it since I left university and I'm now 40. It occurred to me recently that I might live my entire life without ever getting around to it."
"Single for years, nearing 40 and feeling lonely I decided to be mature and non-judgemental when I matched with a woman who had multiple children. We met up and got on really well and have been together six months but her kids drive me fucking nuts. Especially the youngest."
"Interviewed someone today for a client-facing technical role.Although qualified on paper for the role, I will not be hiring this person because they repeatedly said aks instead of ask."
"My sister works for @UKHomeOffice. She's quite nice really, but her department has turned into such a racist shitshow that I'm too ashamed to tell anyone what she does. And so is she."
I had to stop playing Theme Hospital because I got stressed out when I had to fire a member of staff. I wish my hospital had an HR department to deal with that stuff.
"I'm a bloke that's recently grown my hair long and I fucking love it. I tell everyone it's a lockdown hangover and roll my eyes but secretly I love shampooing it, tying it up, etc. I feel like a different person but am too ashamed to admit it's what I actually want."
"Once in school I was sat next to this guy in English. I farted and hoped for silence but instead it made the worst sound ever and this guy just took the blame, went bright red on my behalf, apologised. I often wonder why I didn't pursue him. Thank you, Chris. You're a real one."
"At Glastonbury 2013, I missed The Rolling Stones to have drunken sex with an older woman in my tent. I was in fancy dress as a clown."
I failed maths O level first time round. My parents paid for a resit sat externally from my school. I failed that but told my school I'd passed and they marked my record as a pass.I scraped a D at A level and went to uni. I've just retired as head of maths!

"I have three cats, one of which is a tiny stray cat that adopted me a few years ago. Whenever I have a pee in the downstairs loo she will race to jump up on the bowl and deliberately stands under my golden stream getting soaked. She absolutely loves it and I can't stop doing it."
"Been working on reception at my new job for 2 months now, and still can't work out how to transfer a call. Every time someone rings for any of my colleagues I just tell the caller that they're in a meeting."
"My dog eats a lot of grass. He then subsequently shits it out. Sometimes he won't get it all out and have about 6 of grass strands poking out of his rectum. As gross as it is, removing the grass is quite satisfying."
I created a secret Instagram account purely to look at sexy ladies. The only reel I have saved so far is a hack for getting burned on dirt off of saucepans.
"I started a new job at a company full of very enthusiastic people, to get out of after work drinks I strongly implied that i was a recovering alcoholic"
I am an identical twin and my sister and I share the membership for a very expensive and exclusive leisure club. The only time we nearly came unstuck was when one of the staff commented on how keen I was using the gym twice in one day.
"I was a lazy youngster and as a result would be lax at brushing my teeth. I use a YouTube video to keep my 6 year old brushing their teeth properly. I now watch the same video silently, when I brush my teeth before I start my shift. I'm a 35 year old Police Sergeant."
"I profess to hate subtweets, but I created an alt account solely to slag off the stuff that makes my eyes roll. It's done wonders for my mental health, being able to vent and say exactly what I think about people."
"I still listen to Lost Prophets - although in an effort to somehow improve the situation, I refuse to sing along."
I was in a nightclub in Brighton years ago and after one too many shots I turned round and projectile vomited all over the back of this poor girl's legs. She didn't even notice. I certainly wasn't going to tell her.
"Getting changed at school some kids noticed marks on me, that they put down to chicken pox scars. They were actually flea bites - my mum was an alkie, we had an infestation that she did nothing about. She's dead and I'm now as middle class as cashew butter, but this haunts me."
Told my boss WAP stood for Work Attitude Problem and he just stood up in a staff meeting & said too many people at this company have a WAP. Will probably get fired when he works out why everyone was sniggering.
Had my 2nd secret hair transplant during lockdown in November last year. Family and friends have no idea 'cos I started early before you would really notice. I could now live to be 90 and will never be a slaphead.
I'm currently having to use ear drops. The sensation of a cold drip trickling into my ear makes me let out a groan and shudder. I'm worried I have a weird fetish.
"When my car is parked in front of a crowd, I stand 2 cars away and say Alexa, unlock the car. Then I move to the next car and repeat. Then at my own car I say it, press the button on the key in my pocket, then quickly and suspiciously get in and drive off quick."
"Just reported a Twattish driver to 101. I feel bad for grassing but to be fair, if you have a number plate that starts with BO55 you are a guaranteed twat anyway. Plus you shouldn't cross 2 lanes to cut me up."

"When I was at school, sports stuff was always done in the last period on Friday afternoons. I used to regularly bunk off and go home at the start of the period. No one ever noticed."
"I once found a debit card in my local park and handed it into the bank, but not before pinging myself a double quarter meal from Maccies for being a good samaritan"
"If alone in a public toilet with a trough style urinal I enhance my experience by running from left to right as I wee, imagining I'm playing a piss based space invaders: left/right, up/down. Been doing it for over 30 years; no plans to stop."
"Encouraged my Mum at the age of 68 to get on the internet. Biggest mistake of my life. 10 years later she's the most insufferable fuckwit imaginable, endlessly reciting idiotic conspiracy theories, alt-right bullshit and alternative medicine peddled by con artists."
"There are few greater pleasures than taking your young child into business class with you, I love the looks of horror that we get as they realise they have super excited toddlers on the plane for 12hrs."
I don't block the Sun newspaper on social media just in case one day I film something newsworthy on my phone and I can tell them to 'fuckoff' when they as if they can use the footage.
I make mugs of Knorr savoury gravy and drink it like tea
"I'm a window cleaner but not all of my customers get the same standard of work. If your house is nice, clean and tidy, I will make more of an effort. If your house is a shithole with dirtier windows on the inside than the outside, I think why should I bother. Sort it out."
Dave. It was me who planted the daffodils spelling DAVE IS A CUNT outside your house. Not sorry. You are a cunt.
"Having found that the best skimming stones were a short distance from the lake, we loaded up our pants so heavy they were around our ankles. Good fun until a group of walkers caught two brothers waddling, balls out and laughing hysterically"
Made the mistake of sharing an Apple ID with my wife. Was sitting on the pan watching some porn one day when it suddenly it unexpectedly connected to her AirPods while has was on Spotify. Every time I am on the pan now I am super quick so she knows I am not watching filth.
I pissed in the ice cube tray and put it back in the freezer during a house party in my late teens. I would laugh to myself for years after imagining his parents coming home to popping a few cubes into a drink but now decades later I feel awful for being a nobhead
"When I was about 10 I asked my teacher if I could go to the toilet. He jokingly gave me a jug and told me to use that, so I went in the cloakroom did a piss and handed it back to him."
Sometimes to feel better about myself I read transcripts of court cases where someone has forged a parent's will or coerces them into giving everything. My life might not be perfect but I'm glad I'm nothing like that kind of horrible arsehole
I am a bloke in his 30s. I've driven for years. But I don't think I've ever got used to multi-lane roundabouts and I don't think I ever will. I panic every time I have to negotiate one and always just hope for the best. I'm amazed how anyone gets them right.
I'm a retired exec from an advertising agency. Our main job was to make ads that won awards. That's because awards won us more lucrative accounts. The success of the campaign was least important. This happens a lot in ad agencies.

"I used to work in a restaurant, we always waited til someone had a mouthful before we asked them how things were, saved you having to have a conversation with them."
"After again losing a weeks wages in a bookies I fantasised about robbing the place. How I would get away with it, doing it on Halloween so I could wear a costume. Finally decided to go for it but it had closed permanently. Happily I've just won an online jackpot of 8k"
I miss the relationship I used to have with my wife. I have no feelings for her and we're still good friends but I miss the silly little things. I don't have any of that with who I'm with now and never will.
As a bored 13 yr old I made a Twitter account purporting to be actor Timothy Dalton. It got big with celebs following it. I was spooked into deleting it after a month when Sky dm'd asking for an interview. Sorry to all who thought James Bond was replying and liking your fan art.
"At work, I can spot all the alcoholics. It's like looking in a mirror."
"All through medical school I worked really hard to become a surgeon. My family think I became an anaesthetist because I didn't make the grade, but it's actually because the ratchets in surgical instruments make me feel physically sick when they grind together."
"My wife's narcissistic, asshole father has just disowned her over some minor upset. It's kind of nice to be able to finally slag him off openly to her after 15 years of having to hate him in silence."
I have a bottle of Heinz Salad Cream in the fridge. I never eat it with any food. The only time I use it is whenever I visit the fridge and squirt a big blob onto my finger to eat. I get though a surprising number of bottles.
I miss being on furlough. Being off for a year without having to worry about where my next paycheque was coming from made me realize how miserable working life is.
I'm in my 40s but still like to go out egging houses and cars on Halloween. Tell the wife I'm going pub every year.
"Bought a CD player on eBay. It arrived in just a bin bag all dented. Seller was rude when I complained. However he put his home address and email on the bin bag. I spent days putting his details into every weird, kinky website possible, especially the ones with free catalogues."
"I once got invited into my crush her house with a few friends of mine, for the nerves i started drinking at home. At the party I threw up In her toilet and made the toilet flood. They had to replace the entire wooden floor in the house."
"If staff within a shop are rude or piss me off; on my way out, if possible I turn the open sign round to closed as I am a petty man"
"Like most of us, I've found lockdown absolutely miserable but I have found one new source of joy these last 18 months: leaving milk past it sell by date for 2 weeks then sniffing the bottle intensely to help me climax during a monster wank."
"My teacher was a bully and hated me for no reason, then he was convicted of statutory rape from when he was 18, he was sent to prison. I went to college and he had applied for a job there. I went straight to the Head of department and he was was dismissed that day. I felt great"
"If I'm ever asked who my first celebrity crush was, I always answer Tiffany of 'I think we're alone now' fame because the real answer of Catherine Eddowes, the 4th victim of Jack the Ripper, would reveal how fucking weird I am."

"After getting close, my best friend and I have always told our friendship group that I'm her 'gay best friend'. We've actually been shagging for years and nobody in the group has suspected a thing. It makes me wonder if there's loads of other supposed GBFs secretly getting it on."
Sometimes when I pull out a used tampon I imagine I am giving birth to a little mouse
"When we left the U.K. we allowed our house to be used to house a Syrian refugee family. It was supposed to be for 2 years so they could get settled. Now, 4 years later, we want to sell the house and we've got to evict them. I feel like a right cunt."
I was a raging alcoholic and addict working for an investment bank. During the crash in 08 I was addicted to valium and praised for my calm through it. I was off my tits
My wife wonders why we get through so much Calpol when we don't give our daughter that much. It's because I swig straight from the bottle whenever I fancy it. It's delicious.
I regularly check the website of the newspaper from my wife's home town. Just to see if any of her family have been arrested.
Worked on a piss poor TV show. Told my mates that every viewer call to the BBC is written up and passed to the show's team the next day. Stoned one night we called in with glowing praise of the show. I died inside when I came to work to find everyone delighted by the great news.
"I'm a 40 year old male and often go for months without cutting my toenails until they resemble claws. Few months ago i twisted my ankle at work and the 1st aider removed my sock in front of the whole office, been looking for a new job since, can't live with the embarrassment."
A friend and I walked into a pub wearing suits. 
Without exchanging a word the barmaid reached down behind the bar and brought up several plates of sandwiches. 
As we tucked in to the complimentary food more people came in wearing suits.We'd crashed a wake.
"I want to break up. Wife really wants to keep me, so we're having the best and most frequent sex of our lives. Which is nice."
"I was a relatively successful child thief but when the teachers started closing in, I had to act. I planted a stolen Premier League sticker album under the coat of a friend in the cloakroom to throw them off the scent. It worked a treat. Sorry Tony."
"When I climb stairs or walk anywhere there's a handrail, I like to pretend the rail is electrified and I am an electric locomotive. I am a senior public servant in my '50s."
I have had the same mobile phone for years and have never paid a single bill. I have no idea why it's still working.
"I learned one of my colleagues, who had been a complete dick, was going to be sacked and escorted off site that afternoon. I borrowed £50 off him before he went knowing I was never going see him again. Blew it on a slap up Indian meal. Cheers Andy, you absolute twat."
I wait until my wife goes to bed before secretly restacking the dishwasher.

During lockdown I bought 500 McDonalds coffee beans stickers off Ebay for £10. Used them to get free coffee from the Drive-Thru every day as nothing else was open & it was a chance for us to get out of the house. Worried that my misuse contributed to the withdrawl of the 'bea...
"A few years ago I programmed an application that was somewhat shruggingly adopted by a fairly big company. I get a percentage, which can run up to 6 figures a year, without me really doing anything. I have such middle-class guilt about this I give a lot of the money away."
When I was a kid and my parents would go off in the car I'd always wish they died in a crash. The disappointment of hearing the car pull up on the drive when they came back was overwhelming. Now in my 30s I don't speak to either. They're still horrible people.
"Bloke we used to drink with was a bit of a cock and used to piss thru peoples letterboxes at night on the walk home. I'm sorry/not sorry, Steve, for the times I pretended to join you but instead rang their doorbells without you knowing. You def got what you deserved at least once"
Twat at work pissed off everyone in the office by constantly ordering stuff from Amazon and getting it delivered there when he wasn't in half the time. What started off as hiding his packages ended up and theft and taking the crap home or binning it. Not sorry
"A builder working next door dented my car with his van. He denied it, despite paint on his bumper. Took down his mobile no. off the side of his van and for the next 3 Fridays, he had long and fruitless rush hour journeys across north London to non-existent potential customers."
"My step son had scant regard for our electricity bill, wasted food from our fridge, didn't lift a finger to help with cleaning. He has now moved in with his girlfriend. As passive aggressive payback, I leave the hot water tap running while having a wee at their new house."
"Shagged a woman who was on her period in the back of my car, the day before I traded it in. It had black vinyl seats so I didn't know about the bloodstains, which went right through to the boot, until the police turned up at my work to ask me some awkward questions."
"I farm food for Uk supermarkets, they have driven my prices down so far I cannot pay staff more than minimum wage. As Brexit has resulted in EE staff leaving I cannot harvest this year. Today I ploughed it all back into the land so I can charge treble next year"
"I feel like a failed parent because my 6 yr old daughter is about to get her beloved youtube taken away. The reason? Even though she's on kids youtube, she just wiped her arse, spread it all around the toilet seat, and when asked why she said youtube says It's a PRANK!."
When my wife goes to stay her family at the weekend I have an opportunity to watch porn with sound at a normal level but I feel on edge so I put the volume back down
"When people put polls on social media for serious things such as wedding songs, places to eat for birthdays, holidays. "
I always choose what I think is the worst. 
People shouldn't place serious life choices in the hands of strangers.
"Regardless of who I speak to, I always say fuck you, motherfucker as soon as I hang up the phone."
"The other day in a moment of weakness I payed a woman about $50 to bully me, it didn't really do anything for me and now I genuinely feel like a loser"
"I have an online gambling problem and £40,000 debt. I remember card details too easily so hiding them when I feel bad doesn't help if I get the urge later on. Instead, I have to constantly report my cards as 'lost' to get a new set of details but I just end up memorising it a..."

When I was 12 I was messing about with a friend in our garden and casually threw half a brick at a blackbird. It hit and wounded the bird and next minute a cat pounced on it and finished it off. I'm 43 now and have never really got over the guilt.
Went to a bog-standard comprehensive in Windsor. Every lunchtime we would go into town and fleece the Japanese tourists by pretending to be Eton schoolboys and charging them to take photos of us. Made an absolute fortune. We needed the cash more than the posh twats did anyway.
"I think smoking is absolutely horrible and anyone who smokes is a victim of the tobacco industry. Until I've had three pints, then I basically turn into Serge Gainsbourg and can't get enough of the delicious little bastards."
My OH won't stop watching videos on his phone with the sound up while we're watching tv together so I've started spitting in his tea.
A few of my pairs of knickers are my favourites. Sometimes when getting dressed I wear less comfy ones so that the good ones are still there the next morning.
Wife and I went away for a holiday and slept on the other side of the bed that we normally do. Turns out that for twenty plus years her crap wanks were as a result of using her left hand on me and not get right which is actually really good. So I've missed out on so effing much!!
My neighbours had a weekend away and their arsehole daughter had her noisy pals over for a party. Other neighbour was recovering from brain surgery. So I threw two sealed bags of bicarbonate of soda into their garden. Her parents found them and went mental. No regrets.
I woman I thought I had a chance with was sat opposite me at a party. She lent in for a kiss and I reciprocated. At this point I realised she was just standing up to leave the table. The look of disgust and horror on her face will live with me forever.
Wasn't really listening to my mum telling me about uncle Roy and a date to send a card too Sent him a Birthday card when what had actually happened was my Aunt had died.
I just told my 12 year old son that Elton John wrote the song I'm still standing about the time he tried to become an MP
In sixth grade I put gum on the class bully's chair. It was so bad he cried and had to go home. We had to sit in silence the whole day until someone confessed. I've still never told a soul and would do it again.
"I shared a house with two fellow students. I found the back door key opens ALL the doors - including theirs. I used to let myself in, subtlety change things around then leave and act shocked when they got home. That was 25 years ago and they still talk about 'the ghost house'."
As an adult I apologised to a guy I remembered bullying once when we were young teens. He accepted the apology fine but said he genuinely couldn't remember the incident. Wasn't sure whether to be relieved at not causing any harm or annoyed I was such an ineffective bully.
"Whenever I shave, I think of the edition of This Morning where Richard and Judy discussed the best way to shave, and Richard recommended going 'against the grain'. So I've thought of Richard saying that approximately two thousand times."
"I've started playing a porn game on my mobile phone. You basically have to seduce your landlord and flat mate in to having sex with you. I've played it so much, than when I have actual sex with my girlfriend I picture her as the hot flat mate from the game."
In my 20s I developed a rather embarrassing trademark of putting on a scouse accent when chatting up women after a few drinks. Problem arose when I met a 10/10 and arranged to go on a date. We got on really well but I had to keep the scouse act up for about 5 months.

"Every week I shave my head in the shower, and every time I pretend I'm a fugitive on the run, hastily altering my appearance before Tommy Lee Jones catches up with me."
"At primary school I won a competition for a design for a speed sign. It's still there, and I break the speed limit on that street almost daily."
"I was stage crew on a touring production of 'Singin' in the Rain'. Let's just say, there was more than water in the rain when one particularly egotistic actor was tap-dancing away night after night."
Playing pool in a pub once a ball went under the table. When I went under to fetch it I noticed the coin box was unlocked. Walked out with £150 in pound coins in a beanie. Paid for the rest of the night.
"As a curious teen I heard that microwaving a carrot made an effective anal dildo. All I can say is, DON'T DO THIS, for a thousand different reasons."
"I design newspaper adverts for a few major brands including a terrible high street bank. On most of them, I hide a tiny tiny rude word or drawing of a cock and balls, so small you'd never find it, but I know it's there."
My racist old grandmother had a black cat with an offensive name well into the late 90s. When she died I inherited the cat and had to rebrand it. I called it Snowy. The cat seemed none the wiser.
My garden gets full of slugs and snails. I take great delight in picking them up with a stick and flinging them over the fence into next door's garden and saying 'wheee!'.
I like the idea of getting a blowjob much more than actually getting one. They just don't do that much for me and my girlfriend's jaw just gets tired and we both end up feeling bad about it.
"Invited to a colleagues wedding reception in a few months. He has no idea how big a deal this is for me. I have social anxiety, no social life & am slightly terrified about being at a gathering with no-one I know & just sitting there awkwardly. I am being brave & going though."
First time I was ever in bed with a girl naked I got lost and stuck my finger up her bum
When I was 13 I was caught glue sniffing by the police. Promised my mum that I would never do it again. 
Now 51 and still occasionally take a wee hit. It's the best high ever and I have no intention of giving it up.
I signed up to a well-known gutter press comments section using the name and hometown of a former boss. I spout all sorts of offensive rubbish and attribute it to him.
I was a bully in the 6th form college common room. Threw a tennis ball at a fellow pupil's head until he cried. To this day - 26yrs later - I get stabs of anxiety memory at least once a week. I was a little shit and will take that guilt to the grave.
"Once stole a bottle of pure ethanol from the chemistry lab at school. Not really sure what my intentions were but stashed it in the locker of the school bully from my year. Teachers performed a raid & despite his protestations of innocence, said bully was expelled. Good riddance."

"In 1980, I lied on the schoolyard about seeing 9 To 5. I said that Sheena Easton played the boss's wife & sang Morning Train in the movie, and that Dolly Parton showed her tits. I still haven't seen it, but I'm assuming I was probably wrong on both counts."
"Like a lot of straight men I've sampled a bit of cock. Glad I did, as I now know the smell of balls makes me gag. My balls are now much cleaner as a result also."
I get turned on by washing up. I think it's something to do with watching Confessions of a Window Cleaner in my formative years.
"Once got accidentally refunded £1700 instead of £170. Spent it on a parachute jump, golf lessons and a new hoover."
I have a photo come up on my digital photo frame that I used to hate because I look really fat in it. Now I look at it and realise I've piled on the pounds since it was taken.
I buy hacked account details from the darkweb for all my digital streaming needs. Saved myself thousands over the years.
"I am responsible for at least 3 corn circles that appeared in the newspapers and on TV. Since the advent of better CCTV around farms, corn circles have died out. That or better access to porn."
I found a confidential document about the profit sharing agreement that only the directors and their lackies were supposed know about and be part of. It had a clause that it had to be kept a secret from the rest of the staff. I printed it to the warehouse printer. Multiple times.
"After waiting for a long time for the bill to turn up, me and the misses got up, put coats on, walked to the reception to pay, the staff thanked us for our visit and opened the door so we walked straight out."
"I have an ordinary civil service job, but I use 2 computers, on a wide curved desk and sit on a wheely chair. So I like to zoom from one screen to the other and pretend I'm a computer hacker in a spy thriller."
I sneak up my neighbours drive at night and put things in their bin when mine are full
"Worked for an IT Company got loads of free kit, when I left I didn't hand it back in so sold it all on eBay only as I was selling the last few items did I realise they were water marked and am now expecting the police to come knocking any day"
When playing Scrabble with the family I often 'accidentally' end up with 8 tiles not 7. If anyone notices I explain it away as a silly mistake. But usually no one notices. I have a good win record.

"I walk around in constant amazement that today's women think it entirely normal to wear leggings that show off the precise shape of their arse to any passing ogler. Honestly, what a glorious time it is to be alive"
I have been sticking my knife in the toaster practically every day for the last 20 or so years and I've never once electrocuted myself.
If all the knives are in the dishwasher I'll use the handle of a fork to butter my bread
"For my stag, was told it was Budapest but mate booked Amsterdam, and he paid for a lady for me. She was amazingly attractive, but I didn't want to say yes -betrayal- or no -ridicule-, so ended up talking to her for 2 hrs instead. She was nice, but sad, and it still depresses me."
My girlfriend loves Pizza Express but I absolutely despise it. However I love her so much I'm willing to eat it. Things you do for love eh
"Spent all 4 years at Uni pretending to be vegetarian so that housemates wouldn't suspect me of stealing anything that was either meat, or had meat in it, from the fridge. I stole the lot."
"At school we used to say to each 'your mum's dead' as a routine putdown. I said it to one boy once who replied 'yes, she is' and someone else said 'why did you say that, she actually is' and every time I've thought about that since I collapse inside"
"On more than one occasion i have refused to offer an interview to a job applicant purely based on their email address. I'm sorry Steven, but sexysteve69@hotmail.com just isn't an appropriate email address for a 47 yr old."
"I've always blamed by son for pissing on the seat and make him clean it up. Since moving and now having an ensuite, I realise it was me all along."
I pretend I am not a borderline alcoholic by taking bottles and cans to the tip the week before bin collection to fool neighbours into thinking I never drink enough to fill my recycling bin
Couldn't figure out what the horrible smell was. Turns out the strings on my friendship bracelet was catching when I wiped my arse.
"I stole a usb stick from a former work colleague because I'm a nosey bugger, it contained 8 pics of women wearing double denim and nothing else."
"With 'Scan and Go' supermarket checkouts, I haven't paid for a birthday card for over a year. They are the only thing I'll risk stealing though, as I think I could easily claim I had forgot to scan it if caught. I've never stolen anything else before and it's a small thrill."
"I work in customer facing technical support for a well-known company. You should know that if you email us with URGENT in the subject line, your case will be dealt with last. You aren't any more special than all the other people who are having the same issue as you."
In late middle age my urinating is too weak to wash off the shit stains in the toilet so they sit there. The kids' are like water canons but they have not yet got the aim to take over the job. It's going to be a messy few years.
"Bought a selection of lanyards off Amazon for various Government departments, some fictional, including Firearm Officer, Advanced Weapons Research Department and MI6 - I wear these on the train when I'm going to and from work to make people think I have a fun job - I'm a teacher"

"My wife died when our youngest was 1. Now he's 10, looks like her and has developed lots of her mannerisms and it's killing me"
I search RightMove daily. I have no intention of moving but just like looking at other peoples shocking home decor and nosing around houses generally like a polite stalker.
I lied and said I had Covid to get out of the weird girl at work's last cringe stand-up night and now I actually have Covid so can't go to her next one this weekend either. Everyone is asking me questions about having Covid twice.
"In lockdown I have got in the habit of airing my arse crack out after a shower, really holding it open and going for it under the fan in my private 2nd floor bedroom. Today I looked up and locked eyes with my neighbour, on his roof fixing something. I now have to move."
"That did it tonight. The look of pity/contempt on my wife's face when I asked for a hug, telling me to just not bother any more."
"I used to save secret money up for escorts. Now I'm middle-aged and overweight ,and meant to be dieting - I save secret money up now for pastries from the bakery. It's the same thrill. But cheaper."
I keep a record of all the places I take a shit on a map. Seven different venues on West Street in Brighton is my record for one road.
"I lied to the police about a stolen credit card, flagged when used by a known crook. When phoned I told the cop I'd lost my wallet when drunk in a club, not that a prostitute stole it along with my jeans."
"I once struck lucky with a pole dancer, but when we got down to it all I could focus on was the bogie in her nose. She's now an underwear model for famous catalogue company and looks stunning. I keep catalogue clippings in my bedside table to remind myself bogies don't matter."
"Me and my kids take it in turns to choose songs in the car. I love them but I hate their shite tweeny-pop, so I always choose massively long bangers like Kashmir and Rappers' Delight to tilt the overall listening time in my favour. They never notice."
"About 20 years ago, first time meeting my wife's family she told me to bring some beers. I brought a crate of extra strong 8% lager and her two younger brothers were pissed in no time. One of them is now an alcoholic and i often wonder if I am to blame."
The one downside to working from home is not being able to walk away from a clogged toilet and assume it's someone else's problem now.
"When I'm folding my socks into pairs from a big pile of washing, I take part in the Sock Folding World Cup. The last pair to be united together are the winners."
Training the new girl at work. Didn't like her and thought she could steal my job so I trained her badly: she was sacked. Turns out she was my replacement because they wanted to promote me. Now I can't get tue promotion because I'm apparently shit at training people.
I've been using being 'pinged' by the NHS app to avoid things I don't want to do for months. I don't even have the app installed on my phone.
While on holiday with my tedious in-laws I excused myself to go to the toilet and wanked into the sink. I thought I washed it away but then I went back later and dozens of ants were eating my cum and now I am worried there is a race of human ant hybrids in Spain

"I went blind in my mid-40s. Obviously, I can't drive now, which is a pain in the arse, but secretly I'm so relieved I don't have to worry about owning a car, or having an accident, or any of the risk, costs, responsibility and environmental guilt. I hated driving."
"Sorry Mum.. it was me who cut the tape in your Dirty Dancing cassette in 1995.. but let's be fair here, it is a shit film."
"Used to walk to the bus stop every morning and race a neighbour on the way. We'd say nothing to each other, just try and walk faster in order to reach the bus stop first. One morning I spotted he had a limp, I was delighted - I knew I was going to win the race."
"I worked in a shop where I replaced watch batteries. We never had the right tools to do it properly. After levering the back off with a screwdriver, I used to wrap the watch up in an old rag and stamp on it to get the back on properly. I did that to some very valuable watches."
"I did a house clearance job as a student years ago. boss took the antiques and any valuables, left me to get rid of that computer nonsense. Old man had a pirate DVD operation in his garage. 20 burners, hard drives full of porn, printers and cases. Paid off my student loan."
"The wife always forgets to empty the filter in the bottom of the dryer, in 3 weeks I've made £42 just from the pound coins left in her pocket, she always complains she has none for a trolley"
"To the man I slept with for 2 plus years who was a massive twat in the end. I lied to you. It IS actually small and that does matter, your dog really isn't cute, Bruce Springsteen is so fucking boring and you dress like a Tory MP. And yes, I'm bitter. Your fault."
"When there's a cat in the garden, I open the window and bark at it to scare it away. I've been doing it for years so naturally, my skill has improved so much so that the other day I heard my neighbour comment to his wife that they didn't know next door had a dog."
"I had a porn addiction; I'd stay up late every night going on sex chatrooms, to the detriment of my job, health and family. I couldn't stop untill I realised I had to replace that dopamine hit with something else. So now I'm porn free and fucking obsessed with Doctor Who 2048."
"I often suggest shower sex with my partner. Not that I think it's great, mainly because she has got a bit smelly recently."
"For a university project I copied and pasted an entire section of Wikipedia, when I uploaded it, it got flagged as plagiarism. I edited it, changing all the spaces to ALT+255 - a clear block- and suddenly it was perfectly acceptable. I got a 2-2."
I've started pretending I'm losing my hearing so I don't have to let the dog out in the middle of the night. I have a little chuckle to myself as the husband stumbles around in the dark. I'm evil.
"When I moved into my first flat it felt like too much of a hassle to register for street parking or find out when bin day was. Instead I would walk the 25 mins to work where I kept my car, to drive back, to then drive my full rubbish bag to dump in the work bins and walk home."
"I always buy dark or black undercrackers, in case of any skidder situation"
"I told my boss working from home and not having a proper chair has caused me to have a bad back, they've ordered me an expensive new one. Truth is it's sore because I spend a lot of the day on the floor playing with Lego"
"Car pulled out on me without looking & I crashed into it, killing other driver. Police absolved me of blame. But in the split second I had to react, I steered towards the other driver's door as I knew was weakest part of his car. So to save my family, I probably killed him."

I employ 6 people but I hate them all and would love to sack them. But then I'd have no staff. It's a proper pickle
"Girls weren't in the slightest bit interested in me when I was a teenager, so when I was asked out for the first time by a gorgeous girl I thought it was a joke, and told her to get stuffed. She was serious and burst into tears."
"I have been seeking an affair for some time. Last week, and after chatting online for a month and a few dates, I spent the day in a hotel with a guy I really liked. He dumped me the next day. I guess I deserve it for being a terrible wife."
Forgot that the estate agents were coming round to take photos of the flat I rent before putting it back on the market. I'd left tissues on the bedside table that I'd used the night before to wipe my jizz off my girlfriend's arse.
I only get dressed when I am expecting a delivery. The Uber Eats driver doesn't realise the treat they are getting.
"I used to house share with 4 male student doctors, I really hated one of them so I used his cucumber that was in the fridge to as a dildo then put it back in the fridge."
"When I see overly large, expensive, badly parked cars I park deliberately - within my lines - right up against the driver's side in the hope that they will either learn to drive or buy a smaller car next time."
It's taken me 30 years and two marriages to realise that all I really want is to be left alone.
"My neighbour posted pictures of graffiti tags as 'drug dealer territorial gang signs' convinced the community is in decline. Curious, I asked my 14yr old son what the tags meant. He immediately confessed to tagging the whole area. I am head of the local neighbourhood watch."
"I'm the primary cook in our house. When dishing up, I always give myself the larger portion. I like to think it's chefs privilege, but really I'm just a greedy bastard"
As a student I would buy clothes with a cheque and then take the clothes back the next day and get cash refund. Got me a few nights out but shed load of debt.
"When I get up around 4am, the guy next door is just going to bed. We've got into a routine where every morning he salutes me through his living room window, and I wave back. Not even sure what his name is. My wife thinks it's weird, but it definitely isn't."
When I'm on Zoom calls with work I mute myself and loudly say things like Shut up you fucking idiot and You are an absolute cunt without moving my lips. I know one day I'm gong to forget to mute and get fired. It really makes me laugh though.
"My boss sold the company I worked for to a bunch of shits, so I had a ton of gravel and 16 tons of sand delivered to his house. It destroyed his lawn. Not content with that, I had scaffolding erected on the front of his house. He still has no idea who it was, 30 years later."
"I only ever use Emmental in my cheese sandwiches, having convinced myself the holes make it a 'low fat' alternative to cheddar."
In Tesco carpark I gave a homeless man my trolley to take back so he could keep the pound coin. On my way home I realised I'd used a trolley token.

"Every time my neighbour leaves his flip flops outside his door i put them in the bin,he's now on his 17th pair."
"I am a secret semi-regular cereal binge eater. Every 4-6 weeks, I will buy, consume and covertly dispose the packaging of an entire box of either Coco Shreddies or Weetabix chocolate minis, whatever's on offer. The stomach ache is worth the taste. My wife knows nothing. I'm 36."
Was watching my nephew playing Fifa earlier against the computer. Every time he was losing with a few minutes to go he would change the side he was controlling to the other team. Then claim he won. He's only 7 years old but lost all respect for him.
"My girlfriend wanted to get a flat together in London, I looked at the rental prices for pokey one bed flats and dumped her, moved to Cornwall and now live the dream. No regrets"
"I work in debt collection and once had the account of a boy I hated from school in front of me. I pretended to call him and send him letters but didn't, then I pretended he had ignored all contact and sent the Bailiffs.They got full payment."
I hate it when my girlfriend gets her daughter to draw me a picture or something to try cheer me up; 9 times out of 10 I'm in a bad mood because she's being a horrible little shit.
Kicked a door frame play fighting with my 8 year old after watching Kung Fo Panda and broke my ankle. Had to tell work I did it falling off my mountain bike.
When I worked in my local pub I'd round any drinks order that came to just under a tenner to just over £10. Customers therefore had to bring out an extra note and were therefore much more likely to use the change to buy me a drink.
I spent eight grand on a posh new bathroom in 2018. The toilet has a two button flush and for three years I've been unsure which button is the eco flush and which is the shitshifter. I'm too ashamed to ask the builders and I may go to my grave forever pushing the wrong one.
When I'm carrying my plate back to the sink I like to hold it out in front of me with the knife and fork pointing out behind so it looks like the Starship Enterprise taking a warp jump to the washing up. I'm 40 next year.
"When I wear my brown puffer jacket and am walking down a busy footpath, I imagine I'm Richard Ashcroft, stare straight ahead, snarl a bit and sing Bittersweet Symphony in my head. I am a 63-year-old woman."
"Whenever I get an email from someone new, and before I reply, I always look them up online to see if they are hot. I don't know why - there is nothing to be done with that information."
"When undressing before a shower, I blow my nose into my boxer shorts. I think it's efficient and not wasteful. My wife thinks it's disgusting"
"Sometimes I feel sorry for all the podcasts I've downloaded but not listened to, so I set them off to play at home and then go to work."
Persuaded my wife to stand on her head while naked. We both decided upside down tits were about the most hilarious thing on the planet. Weeks later it still makes us laugh when we mention it.
"Whenever I see someone post something racist on Facebook, I check their profile for an employer. Suprisingly common they put it public. I love messaging them from a burner account of the email sent to HR with screenshots, links and evidence, then blocking them."

I just watched a BBC News report on the Eggborough Power Station cooling towers demolition and for some strange reason it really turned me on. I'm really worried that I'm going to end up like those people who marry the Eiffel Tower or rollercoasters or something.
Part of my job involves dealing with recruitment. It's a long process to apply. Lad who bullied my gf growing up asked me about a job. Told him to apply & I will put a word in for him. The word will be that he's a prick and I will take great pleasure knowing he wasted his time.
"I'm hoping my neighbour falls out of his window while high. It will be karma for him murdering every good song with his awful, terrible shrieking he calls singing that he insists on doing out the window at 1am. We are 4 floors up."
For an English assignment at school we had to write about our childhood. I stole material from Mancunian comedian @HardingMike's routine about primary school. My teacher found it so funny she made me read it out in assembly. Sorry Mike.
Cracked one out and jizzed in a sock one night years ago. Was sharing a room with my brother at the time and he put it on the next morning thinking it was one of his. It may have been one of his. Lots of lessons learned there.
"I've always loved my wife dearly but I recently encouraged her to go away while I look after our 3 young kids, it's made me realise if anything ever happened to her I would be utterly fucked, she must be protected like a rare bird, just don't tell her I'd never hear the end of it"
"Once when stoned me and a mate found 'Kipling' in the phonebook and prank called asking for Mr Kipling, claiming to be from 'exceedingly good cake enquiries' the nice old lady was terribly sorry to inform us he was dead"
Since the 1st lockdown I've been helping an elderly man with his shopping. Everyone thinks I'm a lovely guy for doing it. Truth is every few months he gives me £200 in cash and tells me to have a drink on him. I do but spend the majority of it on coke and escorts.
"A big telco employed me as a freelance copywriter to do templates for complaints letters, but rewrote my work to water down the responses. My wife received one of these mealy mouthed letters, and I used her name to have a correspondence with myself at £750/day for several months."
"When I was about 12 there was a school trip to Alton Towers. I'd forgot to give the letter to my Mom so never paid for a ticket. Come the day I just boarded the coach and hoped for the best, the teachers assumed it was their mistake and I got in for free."
"When I worked away I used to chat up men in hotel bars, they would always buy me drinks and I'd order extra on top - they would always give me their room number and then leave for me to follow - I'd charge my drinks to their room and then slip away to my actual hotel."
"My wife think when I go for a long session on the pot that I'm really having a tug on my personal pipe, but I'm just watching spongebob square pants on my phone."
I've recently sold my house and temporarily lived with my parents. I've now moved into my new house and can't find my sex toys. I've unpacked everything and all I remember is that I packed them in a place where only I would find them but I can't. I love in constant fear.
"I often go into my children's bedroom at night to watch them sleep. As I gaze down on my beautiful sleeping angels I reflect on the miracle of life, and how amazing it is these wonderful human beings were created by me shooting my spooge up their mothers' blurt."
"Every morning I look in the bathroom mirror expecting a Quantum Leap style leap to have happened. So far, nothing. Unfortunately."
"My parents keep hinting that they're going to sell my childhood home, thinking I'll be upset. The only upsetting part is how little they know me - I have nothing but unhappy memories of the place and I'd be glad to never see it again."

"I got so drunk at a wedding that I decided to have a fully clothed shower in my hotel room at 3am. I fell over, smashing a mirror, the shower screen and shelving unit. The next day I made a complaint to the manager that the bath was slippery and I'd fallen and he refunded my stay"
"As an adolescent, the only boy I knew was my brother. I distinctly remember contemplating trying to snog him. I'm so pleased I didn't as I would never have lived it down."
"When I go for a pee, I push the flush before I start and race it to a finish."
"Years ago I stayed in a hotel for a works night out. Before we went out I had the biggest shit I've ever had & didnt flush the toilet - to this day I've no idea why. A girl came back to my hotel, I had forgotten about the shit when she used the toilet. She left immediately after."
On my way to work each morning I get 2 bacon rolls from greggs. I get brown sauce on one and red on the other so the girl serving doesn't think they are both for me.
I say I deleted Facebook because of all the negative crap and political lies. In fact I just couldn't stand any more reminders of how free and easy and happy my life was before I had children. The last straw a memory of a days motorcycling in the sun and I had a little cry.
Me and my Mrs have no sex life. So I started to flirt with a woman online. Decided to meet her at a local park for a walk. I saw my wife at the park bench where I was supposed to meet this woman. I did a quick turn and walked back to my car. I dare not log back on the chat site!
"I loved my Dad to bits, but I cried more watching Avengers: Endgame for the first time than I did at his funeral. I think I'm broken."
"Best public confessions for July - it's been a bumper crop of amusing stuff this month, do share so that more people follow @fesshole and the confessions keep coming in https://t.co/rabs8Gicf5"
"I used to work at the Grattan catalogue office, in the days before smartphones. When bored, I would routinely thwack one out in the bogs over the lingerie pages of the shared office catalogues, then put them back on the shelf."
"Whenever I drink from a thin glass, I really need to resist myself not to take a bite from it. It's a crazy urge I think would really satisfy me."
My boyfriend is shit with money & earns less than me which is ok but he pays a lot less than his proportional share towards mortgage/bills while smoking 20 a day. He can't get a mortgage so our house is in my name only. When our daughter leaves home he's in for a rude awakening.
"Unbeknownst to my wife, the Big Spoon that she uses in our kitchen was actually bought in the 90s when I lived with my ex-fiancee."
This is the only item that I still have from that time and cannot keep it anywhere else except in plain sight to stop it seeming weird.
"My grandparents used to visit on the same night of the week when I was a kid. When I was in my mid to late teens I'd start seeing my friends instead. The years have passed and sadly they're now dead, I'd give anything to spend just 5 minutes with them again."
When my upstairs neighbours are being noisy. I run my fingers along the ceiling as if i'm mice under their floorboards running away from them. They then spend the next few hours being extremely quiet trying to hear them again. I can sleep easy.
"I'm married with kids but have a fake tinder profile. My alter ego gets a lot of matches and I enjoy the chase of trying to secure a date. I never meet them, just block them once I've got it locked down."
"Got queue jumped on a pool table early 2000s. Used the collection of 50ps in the juke box. David Hasselhoff's Jump In My Car, on repeat. Never went back."

In a moment of drunken madness I stole a girl's bag from a nightclub. She'd been dancing with me but I wasn't really into it so picked up her bag and left while she was dancing with her friend. It's genuinely the worst thing I've ever done. Still racked with guilt 30 years later.
"A few years ago I was driving for an American rock band on tour. They wanted to go to the Abbey Road crossing. I couldn't park, so I dropped them off and drove around the block. Going around a tight bend I scraped the side of a very expensive parked Porsche. I never stopped."
Had an assessment in work today and was asked to give my honest opinion about my colleagues. I did. The outcome is my supervisor is being sacked on Monday and I'm taking over her job.
At soft play I saw a 4 y/o wee boy push my wee girl over. Later on he ran past me and I accidentally tripped him up.
"Always knew I'd go grey eventually, but no one ever warned me it could start with pubes."
"There's not much to me as a person really, but had a short burst of confidence years ago and managed to snag my funny, extrovert wife. We moved to a new city and our new friends love her, but pretty much ignore me and rarely invite me along. I dread the future."
"I was on the management team for a special building, part of which was a time capsule to be opened in 100 years. The contents were decided on by a board of directors. I assembled the time capsule and secretly added a hard core porn mag before interring it in a wall."
I'm on my second affair within 12 months. Will someone tell my other half I clearly don't love them anymore please and save me the job.
After I moved into my first house a letter came for previous owner but I had no forwarding address for him. Eventually opened it and it was from a woman who thought he was the son she had given up for adoption. Feel bad it didn't reach him sorry
"I work at a university and frequently sit in sessions where students have to present work from their own laptops. The variety of porn sites that I have glimpsed in open browser tabs, 'frequently visited' shortcuts, etc. has been genuinely eye-opening. Thanks for the tips guys."
"Worked at a poncy dairy that made much of the credentials of its butter, the result of ancient herds, organic land etc. Main reason everyone loved the butter was because they put shit loads of salt in it."
Once had to spend Christmas with girlfriend's dull family. Only way I would agree was if I could take my Xbox. They only had one TV so I dominated it for the whole Christmas. No one could watch anything just watch me. We split up soon after. Racked up about 24 hours of game time.
"I don't know if anyone else does this but I sweat so much when I take a dump, I always lay a cable completely naked. Sometimes when I'm extra sweaty, I wipe the paper on my brow first and use it as a makeshift wet-wipe."
I've just realised I've become one of those vaguely humorous t-shirt guys. This has been an horrific realisation and one that comes to an end today. If you like vaguely humorous t-shirts I would suggest visiting the RNLI shop at Bideford.
"At my local one night, got a call from the supermarket delivery guy. He's 45mins early, can he pls drop off now? I could easily have popped home but said no. Got another pint in. Went home to find the guy looking utterly broken, crying. Still haunts me. What had I made him miss?"
"Discovered daughter had severe nitt infestation recently so we all had to check. Despite tons of combing I only found two, but lots of scabs/flakes etc. Depressed to realise my scalp is the equivalent of a post apocalyptic hellscape even nitts wouldn't be seen dead in."

Each lottery draw leaves me feeling a genuine and deep sadness as I spend so much time fantasising about what to do once I win.
"My wife's friend hangs out in tight fitting clothing every time she stays over at our house, and flirts outrageously with me. She has an insane body and I'd love to submit to her charms, but I know I'd lose my wife and kids as a result. Wanking saves marriages."
"My boyfriend spontaneously took me from behind over the back of the sofa, I noticed my cat staring at me so I stared back at him until it ended."
I regularly swap cheap battery eggs for organic eggs whilst at the egg isles.
I teach ukulele to yr 6 pupils. I could quite easily fucking horsepunch some of them by Christmas.
"I first started going into pubs at 15, my only pub knowledge of pub etiquette was seeing Mike Baldwin at the Rovers. I would hand over a fiver for 2 bottles of Pils - £1.15ish each - and say keep the change. Didn't understand why I was so popular with barmaids."
"My fortieth happened deep in lockdown, so we couldn't celebrate it. Many people forgot. I feel robbed of a milestone, and I will continue to seethe about it until someone makes a fuss of me."
"When going out to restaurants as a child with my parents I was always the last to leave the table, my dad always left cash tips which I would pocket and put in my NatWest pig at home. I honestly thought he was just being careless, this went on for years until I was rumbled."
I deliberately join Zoom meetings a few minutes late. Not only does it make me appear busy but it also lets me skip most of the cringeworthy banter.
"Sometimes if my baby does a solid little poo not long after I change him, I just fish the poo out by hand and give him a quick wipe rather than waste a nappy. I work in finance and earn nearly £100k a year"
My guitar playing is coming on in leaps and bounds since I've been able to attend all my boring meetings remotely with camera and mic off instead of pretending to be interested.
"I post attitude magazine to my happily married friends house every month in a plain brown envelope with a cover note to cancel the subscription with a url that goes nowhere, its driving him round the bend. I dont even know why I do it. The idea popped in my head one day."
I'm living with my inlaws and they seem to be getting bored of the raspberries I blow as a tune around the house. They don't know the only reason I do it is because I did a huge fart the other day and tried to cover it by blowing raspberries afterwards. It's been five days now.
"My job is that I work for an essay mill. I earn £50,000 p.a. from it but I work bloody hard. I tell people I work as an academic researcher. I have written over 4,000 essays for pay since 2008. I don't like helping people cheat, but as an introvert, it suits me well."
My foreskin is so tight that any sexual arousal is painful. Too embarassed to go see the doctor because I'm 37 and should've had it sorted out decades ago.

Had a brain wave at the start if lockdown and automated much of my job. Due back in the office next week and I have no idea how to look busy
I wish my partner had told me they were infertile before I fell in love with them.
"After trampoline lessons as a teenager, we had to fold and wheel the trampolines back into the storage room. I saw a parent pushing one on his own and asked do you need a hand?, to which declined. When he walked back out, I noticed he only had one arm. Absolutely mortified."
"Wife and I are taking our baby daughter abroad on holiday with her family for a holiday in a couple of weeks. We have agreed that if one of us tests positive before we go, the other would still go with the baby. Really hope I get mild covid so I can just have a week to myself."
"My son has turned 6, and has started losing his baby teeth. We said that the tooth fairy has set a rate of 50p per tooth. In the last month alone, he has lost 4. However, unbeknownst to him or his Mum, I have been using the same 50p over and over. Kids cost enough as it is."
My wife of 18 years described our friendly but dysfunctional relationship as housemates who have sex once or twice a month. A fair and accurate assessment.
My 2 year old can't say oink oink for a pig noise. He says wank wank. He doesn't say this. He shouts it.
"Whenever possible I ask him what a cow, sheep and then a pig says in front of other people to see their reaction. Twice people have spat out drinks nearby."
"Bought a rolling pin because I thought it would fit nicely up my arse. And so it did. But now it's in the kitchen drawer, and every time I use it as a rolling pin I remember where it's been."
I dislocated my shoulder while wiping my arse but told work that I fell down the stairs.
I'm 30 next week and I've just realised I've spent the best years of my life playing computer games and getting into arguments about the Government on twitter instead of doing something with my life. You'd think this would give me motivation to change but it hasn't.
I once arranged to meet someone for sex in a hotel. Took a while getting myself ready in the room and decided to trim my pubes but accidentally cut my ball sack and had to call it off. Couldn't even get an erection for a week.
I spend £40 a month on watercress.
"I've got a habit of chundering when I come up on MDMA. One night in Fabric, me and my new girlfriend were kissing and it happened. I was sick in her mouth before I pulled away and spewed the rest on the floor. Worst thing I've ever done to her and 10yrs later we're still together"

"26 years ago I told my sisters our mum died peacefully, nodding off after a late-night chat. However, she was straddled by an ER doctor who repeatedly cracked her sternum and ribs trying to restart her heart. It was brutal and messy. I'll never tell them the truth."
"If I'm at home watching a film on TV and there's a murder scene, I always turn the volume up in the hope that the neighbours will think the screaming and gunshots are happening in my flat. Not once have they ever called the police."
In the early 00s I accidentally started a gang war by painting a rival gangs tag next to my local gangs tags and putting a line though. Not even sure why I did it but it caused holy hell between them to this day. I was never even in a gang. Wonder how many folk got hurt over it.
"Whenever I make gravy for my family I always lick my finger, pop it into the jar of Bisto and then rub it around my gums and teeth like a drug dealer testing cocaine in films. I am 49 years old. I have never tried cocaine."
During lockdown working from home has largely involved shagging the mrs several times a day with my wireless mouse in my hand to keep my teams status green. I've lost 3 stone.
"I drive an automatic car and each time I have a bottle of pop in the drinks holder, I use it as the gearstick and pretend I'm manually shifting through the gears as I drive along."
"In the 1990s I had to recruit a board level scientist. I placed ads in the Times and Guardian. The response was huge. To whittle the field down to a manageable level, I threw the unopened envelopes into the air and only selected from the ones that landed stamp upwards. Sorry."
Thought my phone was broken because the volume and speed of podcasts I was listening to kept randomly changing. Eventually realised it happened every time I scratched my arse because I was changing the controls on my Apple Watch with my trousers.
"Someone fly tipped a bag in a local beauty spot containing Amazon packaging with their address. I re-packaged selected items and popped them in the post box without a stamp. They will need to visit the depot to collect their rubbish and pay postage. Hi Gordon, you've got mail."
I think there should be a new olympic event for walking a long distance with a turtle's head without shitting yourself. I've just set my own personal best. The hill climb was the worst bit. Another couple of yards and this baby would've been everywhere.
"Sometimes when I'm at work miles away from home, I like to think when I whistle my dog can still hear me and it comforts him."
There's a kid on the train playing a song about stranger danger on repeat completely unaware that at least a dozen strangers currently want to kick his little head in. I'm front of the queue.
Working from home in the pandemic. I regularly been participating in team meeting calls whilst fully in bed and half asleep. Only saying the word Yes! when I hear my name mentioned or called.
Wife went away for a couple of days. I forgot to feed the cats as I'd just bought a PS5. Had to throw away 4 sachets of unopened cat food as she was arriving as I thought she'd see how much food was left in the cupboard and tell me off. The cats were really happy to see her!

"When I was 5 years old, I saw someone drawing swastikas in a movie. I then took some chalk, and started drawing them all over our village, including the main square. People called the police, and it was not until a few years have passed that I realized what I did."
"The child of my wife's sister looks nothing like her hubby and a lot like me. My eldest child looks a lot my brother-in-law. It's possible that during my affair, six years ago, my wife had one too. I can't ask her, otherwise she might ask about those Conferences in Harrogate"
"For some time now I have been using Alexa-controlled light bulbs, one with a built-in speaker, to convince my flatmate that we are being haunted by a poltergeist. He is getting rather freaked out now, and I am hoping to push this to the point that he seeks out an exorcist."
Aged 13 I was sacked from my round delivering free papers because I dumped them all in the porch of a house with a no free papers sign. At the time I thought it was big and clever. 33 years later I still think it was big and clever.
I once met someone fishing who let me have a go. The rod was a family heirloom he told me. The man nipped to his car briefly as I cast the line. The top of the rod flew off into the lake. I ran away before he got back. Sorry
I buy myself expensive cycling gear and have it delivered to a collection point. I then mail it to myself in shite packaging and tell my wife I've had an EBay bargain. Been going on for five years now. Fucking life hack guys. Get on it.
"I have a one year gap on my resume, which I fill with working for a marine conservation organisation in Belize. I was actually stripping for the year to clear debts and build a house deposit. I'm a lawyer now."
"Everytime my nipples get hard for no reason, I like to imagine it's because someone is having a wank while thinking of me."
"Although I often joke how I hate the phrase live laugh love, in secret I craft hand-made wooden signs with the phrase emblazoned across it. They sell really well in local gift shops and it's extra pocket money for me. I'm a 44yo man."
"Whenever people are a dick to me on social media, I track down what they do for a living and aim to waste their time. This week, I have a three-hour golf lesson booked at a course 250 miles away. Nobody will be turning up."
"Recently I have become very selective with the porn I watch. I need the mans penis to be just right. Not too big, not too small and uncircumcised. I am a straight man."
I'm a 23 year old lad who likes football and pints but on a Tuesday morning 10-11am I enjoy zumba. I go down to the community centre and shake my stuff with 50 year old women named Diane and Karen and I love it.
"My boss is a foot shorter than me, so if he pisses me off, I take all his personal crap off his desk and put in on a high shelf.Then hide the stepladder."
"I worked for years for Royal Mail. As posties, we got paid extra to deliver door to door mail - junk mail to everyone else. I took most of it home and burnt it. I was never caught and pocketed the money. Fuck you capitalism."
What my kids know: they always get an equal number of chicken nuggets. What they don't know: I share them out equally then eat any extra in the kitchen before serving

"In the late 90s I was the moderator of a lesbian chat room. I was also a fat bearded man, but then I suspect many of the other ladies were too."
"When I was 19 I bought some expensive lingerie for my girlfriend. She wore it once and we split up not longer after. I washed it, re-wrapped it and used it with a girl I had a fling with, then did the same again with a woman I worked with. Sadly, the last one kept it."
I am still deeply in love with a woman I worked with 10 years ago. We're friends on social media and my heart soars when she likes or comments on my posts because she adds a X
Thank god handshakes are now a thing of the past with covid. Had horrifically embarrassing sweaty hands like a damp fish and spent my life worrying before meetings and wiping them on my trousers. Fist bumps saved me!
One of my colleagues spent £100 on Premium Calls when he was isolating. When the director flagged it with me I had his back and said that we needed to boost his data plan as it was internet roaming charges - and he thanked me for saving money.
"I work in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. I find it increasingly difficult to counsel people when I spend my weekends getting fucked up. They confess their problematic use, which is peanuts compared to some of the stuff I get through on a weekender 😬."
"Went with my wife, to pay our respects to her recently passed father, to a small country graveyard. Told my Mrs the emotion was too much and i needed a walk. In reality I badly needed a shit, which I then took in a neighbouring field."
"In 2008 I was a local news photographer. Many of the jobs were 'photograph this street where a person was stabbed / burnt alive / robbed'. I got a kick out of parking within these shots, to ensure my car made continual secret appearances in the local rag."
"As kids, my older sister and I stole two super soakers from someone's lawn while walking home from summer school. At that time our parents were divorced so both assumed the other bought them for us and never bothered to ask about them."
My mother in law was staying with us during lockdown. She's the laziest woman and does nothing but sit on her fat arse and watch TV. I used to play with the TV from my phone to amuse myself. She got so annoyed she bought us a new TV as she thought ours was broken. Result
"I once had a loan I was struggling to clear. One month I had a spare £50 lying around so I decided to make an overpayment. £3k loan just disappeared, they never took another payment and their website said it was settled. I said nothing. They went into administration last year."
"I adore my son, but I always wait until 6pm on the dot to pick him up from nursery, despite finishing work at around 4. I pay £200/month for one day a week and I'm fucked if I waste a penny of it. I normally spend the free hours wanking and watching shite on tv."
"Age 19 I was the only woman in our warehouse. A forklift driver was once in two minds about calling me 'queer' or 'weirdo' and ended up shouting 'queerdo' by mistake. I've been wearing it on t-shirts ever since. Cheers, asshole!"
My dentist is crap and expensive but I keep going because she has massive knockers that she sticks in my face when she bends over to look in my mouth.
"Convinced the Mrs into pegging as a try everything once thing. Hated it, full on thought I was gonna die. Now its all she talks about when the kids aren't about. She's loving it and buying bigger dildos. I've tried telling her but she thinks I'm playing hard to get."
I have stock options which briefly went from being worth nothing much to about £100k before crashing again. I didn't realise until too late. It's eating me up inside that i didn't sell them. I can't tell my family the reason I'm depressed is I fucked up our financial security.

"When consulting for a large client, I accidentally deleted their ERP / accounting software database in error whilst working over lunch. I restored the previous days backup without anyone noticing. I regular wonder how much it cost them in lost invoicing revenue."
"I tell old Billy Connelly jokes at work to people far too young to have heard them before, in my head I'm doing them a service by introducing them to a brand new crowd."
"I told my wife I had to stop working at our allotment because of work pressures. But really it was because I couldn't face any more arguments about what to plant where, so I left her to do it on her own."
"Thanks to Facebook, I've recently discovered that both the first girl I kissed and first girlfriend are now lesbians. I've never felt more of a failure."
"I own 1 rental property, it's my pension and will help to secure my family's financial future, rent is below market level, property is perfect, any tenant issues dealt with immediately, yet I still feel like a capitalist fuck pig about owning it."
"Age 15, I once found an unwrapped condom in the street gutter of a bus stop. The packet was mostly intact but there was definitely a small tear that I chose to ignore, fueled by the rush of wanting a try a condom on for the first time. Took it home for a posh wank."
"Sometimes, when Alexa pisses me off for not listening properly, I make her count to a hundred then leave the room."
I used pay myself overtime from the cash machine in the bank I worked at who refused to pay me the extra hours I worked. Taking the odd random note never flagged up as there were constant errors anyway.
"Once bought organic veg from a market and cooked it for a roast with my in laws. As we sat down to eat realised it was covered in boiled caterpillars. Said nothing, ate nothing, got away with it."
Worked for a stationery supplier. Our 'printing dept' for letterheads and business cards was really a local printing business down the road and we charged customers 40% more than if they'd dealt with the printers directly. This is commonplace.
My jizz doesn't taste the same since my vasectomy
"Returned to the office last week and saw the lady I was having an affair with 16 months ago; Covid restrictions have not been kind to her, so advised her that I now have a girlfriend who I am in love with… I haven't"
"I cycle to work along a bike path that runs parallel with a train line. Whenever a train pulls past me I like to pretend I'm Tom Cruise on his motorbike in Top Gun, racing a fighter jet down the runway. I pump my fist at the passengers and sing Highway to the Danger Zone"
I shared a bedroom with my brother until I left home at 18. We also had a communal socks and undies drawer.
"I once had my legs waxed for charity at work. Raised about £250. Came to leave the company about a year later and, upon clearing out my desk drawer, realised the cash was still there and everyone had forgotten about it. I kept it."
I sometimes pretend to have impacted ear wax so that my colleagues don't talk to me. I make sure I say what a lot to further put them off.

"I landed every teenager's dream job with a role in a porno, I was able to shoot a threesome with two milfs as their 'son/step-son'. However the pressure of being watched by six production blokes quickly meant I was dropped but it was a great experience for the hrs I was on set."
"At the same time as she bemoans our childrens' lack of creativity, my wife blows her lid when the cushions on the couch are shifted even slightly as they make 'hideouts' or there's the occasional bit of lego left on the floor She won't hear any objections. Drives me insane."
"Brought my new girlfriend to a fancy hotel. Forgot to pack the condoms, hotel had none. I went out to get them. Got in a street fight with a mugger before getting away. 30 minutes later I arrived back with condoms, blood on my face but my girl was asleep. Had a Posh wank though."
"My husband gets notifications from this @fesshole account. I think it's because he's waiting for me to confess something on here. Message to him: stop it, I'm not going to."
"Sometimes, when I'm driving and bored, I pretend I've been shot dead by a nearby assassin, slump my head to the side, and press down on the accelerator."
Whenever I find a bottle of shower gel or shampoo in a gym or campsite shower cubicle I use it all. No matter how much is left. I love the really indulgent soapy shower I get on someone else's behalf.
"I had been seeing a married personal trainer for around six months our sessions became more and more flirty. Ended up taking her out for drinks where we both got very drunk. Long story short I'm now a Dad, living with the most wonderful PT."
Had a family picnic after harvest. My 13 year old said I bet that you couldn't roll that hay bale down the hill. I did and it went through a fence and smashed a shed to pieces.
"Recently, I've got into the habit of going on walks by myself. To come across as less strange, I cup the cigarette I'm invariably smoking from passerby's sight so they might think it a spliff. Better to be a wondering stoner than a sober man walking alone all times of the day."
"My girlfriend is dying in a hospice. She can't eat her food. I ate it. Didn't know they'd put laxative in, to help her functions. 45 minutes later, on the way home, I shit myself in the car."
I secretly like having to pick all the sticky grass buds out of our spaniel's big ears. It reminds me of picking shit out of my bum hairs. Very therapeutic
When me and my ex broke up he never bothered removing my access to his Google calendar. He quickly started online dating and would put these dates in his calendar as 'username from site'. I found the profiles of the women from his calendar and told them he was married
Five years ago I told my wife I had successfully sold my 700 CDs on Music Magpie. Truth is I couldn't be arsed and they've been in a cabinet at work ever since. I now have night anxiety as my company is downsizing and I have to move them again.
When I wash my children's hair I apply the shampoo to their heads like a top chef decorating a plate
"My brother killed himself 3 years ago. I found his note on his laptop: police did after. In it, he said how much he hated our parents and they were one of the reasons that drove him to this. I will never tell my parents."

"Don't know if anyone else has felt this way before but I feel I have grown too far apart from some of my best friends. They aren't funny, they use the same jokes and speak about the same things over and over. I think I've outgrown them now and it scares the shit out of me."
"I once woke the wife up and shagged her, just to stop her snoring and in the hope I would then get to sleep before she started again."
"During the first lockdown I started to occasionally 'treat' myself to a sit-down wee. They were so comfortable I find it hard to do a stand-up wee now. Yes, I'm a 38 year old male and 90% of all wees I do now are sit-down wees. Thanks COVID."
I used to be self employed and got a tax rebate annually by collecting receipts for work related expenses during the tax year. I'm no longer self employed but I still collect receipts for work related expenses just in case I feel like commiting fraud.
Gave a recently deceased friends' boyfriend a pity blowjob simply to see if she was telling the truth about his enormous dick. She was not and I'm annoyed she was lying to me.
My husband has gone away for a long weekend with his mates. Finally the dishwasher gets loaded the correct way. Result
"When I see night-time photography of cities and urban scenes, I always zoom in on the buildings to try and spot people fucking at the window. Statistically, it's bound to happen at some stage."
I was so excited to eventually split and move out from my ex's and had imagined my new life in my new house vividly. That was 3 months ago - I have gotten blind drunk and eaten Ben & Jerrys every night and put on 3 stone. I'm just glad I don't have my old dealers number.
When I see fesshole sink pisser confessions I always think that they're amateurs. Over the side of the bath tub is loads easier. No cold porcelain contact with c&bs. Shot countless loads of jizz over there too. My wife would be fucking furious if she ever found out.
I had bad diarrhoea while staying over at my then girlfriend's parents house & decided to shit in the shower to make it easier. About an hour later I was having a ciggie in the back garden and noticed thier drain was blocked with leaves and overflowing with my brown soapy shit.
"My 4 year old was playing his game on my mobile, and he asked me to try it. Without much interest I had a go, and lost quickly. He laughed and called me an old man. I took the phone back and set a high score he'll never make. Cheeky bastard"
My girlfriend and I regularly have sex wearing the elephant masks from the kids game 'Doh Nutters'
"I had stomach ache whilst visiting my parents' house, so my wife lifted my top and kissed my stomach. To my dad, who walked into the lounge, it looked like I was receiving a BJ. He smiled, winked & left. I've never corrected him, or told my wife, who didn't notice him come in."
Every now and then I like to go to The Works and imagine the disappointed faces of all the celebrities whose shit books got remaindered.
The long-term partners of all my wife's friends have cheated. I'm seen as the exception. I tell her I have eyes for no other woman in our 15 years of marriage and this is true because it doesn't include the men and all that cock.
"I have a silly habit of changing song lyrics to make them obscene. I used to sing these round the house when I was alone but since Covid-19, I've been caught doing it by my wife and kid. My daughter now thinks the Bee Gees hit is 'I'm deep in your ass'."

"As a lifelong fan I was a bundle of nerves going to see Kate Bush's live shows in 2014. Puked in the toilets when I arrived, cried through the show, and pissed myself near the end. Got home to discover I'd shat myself a bit too."
I'm a woman in my 40s and addicted to Xbox360 DOA Xtreme Volleyball. I know I really should have something better to do with my time but I don't think I will ever get bored of watching those big titties bouncing around on my screen. They just don't make them like that anymore.
"Clearing out storage boxes of stuff at work a few years ago, found a bunch of old books about to go in the skip. One was a signed limited edtn book by HRH Prince Philip. Kept it to flog when he inevitably popped his clogs. Put it on eBay the day after he died, sold for £400."
I won a hefty payout from a former employer for a workplace injury that was sustained whilst drag racing a colleague on office chairs. My opponent was the sole witness and complicit in a cover up in return for a cut of my compo. Worth the inconvenience of a broken wrist.
"For 38 years my wife's time management had been piss poor. Always late, cancelled appointments, pissed off friends & family. But it's everyone else fault in her mind. Her new boss has just issued her with a 2nd warning for being late. And I'm secretly delighted."
I severely lacked confidence in my teens and twenties. Now in my mid-forties I've overcome that and realise I could have been an absolute player in my youth. But I'm married now and am devastated that I will never be that person.
I am more proud of using every single bathroom on my university's campus throughout my degree than the degree itself.
I returned from a festival in the early 00s without much memory of what happened on the last night. Turns out I got a bit - very - rowdy and was partially responsible for the band Gay Dad deciding to disband.
"Sometimes I match my roommate with a fake Tinder account and agree to come over, so that he will clean the apartment. When it's clean I then cancel."
"As an older single person, the first lockdown was amazing for me. All my friends that weren't used to being stuck at home suddenly wanted to talk. I was zooming with friends all the time. Now everyone's back to socialising and I'm alone again; it's killing me"
"I once got caught short on the walk home after a night out; I didn't want to just poo in the road so I shoveled down my fast food, shat in the empty foil tray container, popped the lid back on and left it on someone's garden wall. Birmingham c. 2008. Sorry if that was your wall."
"I'm at a wedding, it's someone my wife was at uni with and a guy we've never met, we don't know fucking anybody, they all seem tedious as fuck and the most fun I've had all afternoon is hiding in the toilet and writing this"
"Me and my neighbour share a dividing wall in the back garden, which we both have put potted plants on- she kept knocking mine off and breaking them so I started pushing hers off- set up cameras to catch her red handed… turns out it was my cat knocking them off not her sorry ..."
I'm a 51 year old male and recently borrowed my daughters microscope to check the results of a five knuckle shuffle. Pleased to say there are still plenty of swimmers in the tank.
I work in a chemistry lab. During lockdown 1 last year homeschooling and life in general got so stressful that I started stealing pure ethanol from work and drinking it with coke. Really took the edge off.
"Working from home has created some bad habits, like ordering lunch via delivery services because the front door is closer than my kitchen."

I have an exceptionally hairy arsehole and I have finally decided to shave it. However there has been an unexpected side effect and now the tone of my farts has changed completely
"I pretend to enjoy camping as my wife loves it. In reality, I'm counting down the seconds until I can go home."
I have two separate Twitter accounts and have arguments between myself with them on other peoples threads. It's funny to see people both defending and admonishing me at the same time.
After my cat died when I was 16 I couldn't knock one out for two months for fear of her witnessing it from cat heaven
"I told my ex she got us barred from a pub, when she was very drunk. Because she was a massive twat & made herself look stupid, falling over slurring her words and almost pissing herself. I couldn't face going back in after being in there with her"
"Once went back to a girls for fun and games. All of a sudden was desperate for a shit and literally had to go. No toilet roll. No towels were harmed, I had to just shout her to bring the goods. What a nightmare. Never saw her again."
"To add spice to shitty zoom calls, when everyone does the corny 'byeeee' at the end. I have a screaming goat ornament and I press it next to the mic. During the verbal melee of everyone talking at once, the mysterious goat causes mass confusion."
I've just pulled a nose hair so long and thick i could've moored a oil tanker with it this may be my proudest moment in life
Another wasted evening with the wife watching TV neither of us has any interest in until it is late enough to be acceptable to go to bed. Is this it now until we die?
When I was looking ripped after a workout at my gym I used to flex my muscles in the mirror that was positioned on the way to the shower. After several months I realised that the mirror was actually the window to the sauna. A sauna full of men looking back at me flexing.
"Since lockdown eased I've realised a long held ambition to sleep with three women in one weekend. I'm not much to look at and no great shakes in bed, but there is so much untapped frustration out there that even guys like me are getting a sniff."
"About twenty years ago an old school-friend took his own life. Whenever I think of him today I think about what a waste it was: not because of his talents and potential, but because he had the biggest cock any of us had ever seen."
My local council make you book an appointment to go to the tip. They used to be really hot on checking you plate but have slackened off recently. I was late for my appointment recently so I edited the time on email and forwarded it back to myself. Worked a charm.
"Around 15 years ago I came out as gay to my dad, he quickly changed the subject to Roy Keane leaving Manchester United and we never spoke about me liking it up the arse ever again."
Before my granddad died he told me he wanted to try drugs. I'd visit him daily and take edibles and we'd get high together daily. The only other person that knew was his Marie Curie nurse and she said as long as we don't smoke it she wouldn't grass to the family. She never did.
During lockdown I would regularly judge the amount of booze in my neighbours' recycling. Virtually nothing! Fucking lightweights.

My 5 year old daughter woke me in the middle of the night to tell me she felt sick. Couldn't be arsed getting out of bed so told her to climb in with me. Wasn't long before I realised she'd actually been sick all over her PJ's and in her long curly hair. Not the best night ever.
I worked with a guy for 6 years & we were pretty good mates. A couple of years after I left the job I got a call to say he'd died in a tragic accident. Went to his Facebook page to see he'd unfriended me. I made an excuse so I didn't have to go to his funeral. I was that livid.
"My fiancé and I have been together for almost 10 years after what started as a casual office fling. She adores me, but I'm not sure I feel the same. I only asked her to marry me out of guilt as she left her husband to be with me."
"Used to work on checkouts too. It isn't just yoghurts opened for rude customers! Pushing fingers into bread as you put it into the bag, flipping open the lid of their washing up liquid and give it a queeze. Common practice! If you're going to be rude, pack your own shopping!"
I live in mortal fear of my wife ever accidentally talking about when it's time to go to bed. Every night she's asks in a childlike voice is it time to put the bubby to bed?
"After two years of discussing all matters Turkish with my barber - holidays, cuisine, football etc. - I found out he's from Morocco and has never been to Turkey."
"While on Microsoft Teams video calls for work, I get the urge to use the mouse cursor to pick people's noses, pop spots etc. "
I'm worried I'll get caught doing this on a screen share sometime soon
"My mum had a crack on her iPhone screen so decided to show me and my sister, she sent us a screenshot of it into the group chat and couldn't understand why we couldn't see the crack- she sent it 3 times getting angrier each time as to why the crack wasn't showing up"
When searching for a birthday card for a family member I find a card with a lovely heartfelt warm message inside. I then buy a different card and write the same message inside to make it look like they are my own lovely heartfelt warm words.
"When I have to write a letter from my employer, I always begin with By the power of Grayskull before sheepishly changing it something more adult."
As a rural police Inspector I used to dread the summer months & the numerous raves and associated problems so I started printing and handing out a notice stating that the area they were on was a site of special scientific interest. It wasn't true. Sorry ravers.
I've had 2 shits recently that have looked like wizard hats. Maybe I've finally discovered my superpower after 41 years. Need a better superhero name than Shitcone though.
"Back in high school, a girl in my form hugged me. That was the only time anyone in that school was ever nice to me for no reason besides just wanting to be nice. I still think about it regularly. Thank you Ellie. It genuinely meant a lot to me."
"I decided to stop initiating sex with my OH to see if she'd ever initiate it as an experiment. She hasn't. It's been 3 years now and she clearly isn't bothered. I miss it, but don't want to make her feel like she should have sex with me just for my sake, so I won't mention it."
I am in a very happy fulfilled relationship but have an addiction to dating websites. Now and then I will sign up to Tinder for a couple of days just to see how many matches I can get chatting. I know I'm a terrible person.
I'm in my 40s and have been using the London underground my entire adult life but still confuse eastbound and westbound. I have to mime the compass points saying Never Eat Shredded Wheat to ensure I get the right train.

Years ago after multiple car break ins on our street and being hit twice ourselves. I left a bag of what looked like speed wraps in the glove box although they were full of rat poison. We got broken into again and mysteriously the break ins stopped afterwards.
"I'm trapped in an abusive relationship but since it's with my cat and I could obviously beat the shit out of him in a straight fight, I'll tolerate it."
I tell people I'm really into music festivals. The truth is that I merely attended a couple of Radio One Roadshows in 1988 hosted by Mike Read in Skegness and Cleethorpes.
"As a doctor and a huge Adam Ant fan it gave me great pleasure last week to finally say Stan, it's your liver"
"When I worked on the phones in customer service I would give people punishment holds for doing things I didn't like, 2 mins for swearing, 3 mins for shouting at me or not listening. 1 min for talking to someone else at the same time, 6 minutes for eating"
"I used to work weekends in a shoe shop from when I was 16-18, they paid us a pittance that I couldn't actually afford the things we sold. I broke the zip on an expensive pair of boots so the manager would reduce them, then I bought them for £10 and got the zip fixed for a fiver."
I cheated on my gf which led to me getting a lovebite.When I got home the next night I crawled into bed with her and instigated sex.I made her bite me exactly where the lovebite was. She wouldn't stop apologising the next day.
"Spent 20 years as a member of CAMRA, evangelising about real ale to my friends, going to beer festivals and everything. I've only just accepted that most real ale actually tastes like vile piss. I've switched over to lager and it's much better. No more shit hangovers either"
I have been telling my kid that The Avengers reruns are actually the first version of the MCU films he adores. He firmly believes John Steed is Ironman's dad and what started as a gag has become painful as he's got hooked.
Talking of the Atari XE I'm supposed to be building a video cable for a mate with a 130XE. I've got all the parts except for a 1k resistor for the audio. I might just buy a cable on eBay and cover it with electrical tape to make it look homemade.
My husband is concerned that his management style is alienating his team at work. He wants me to assure him that he's in the right and that he's not a mean asshole. So I do. But really I know he's a bullying prick and they have every reason to hate him. He treats them like shit.
"I damaged the woodwork in my rented flat. Not wanting to lose the deposit when I moved out, I did a bodged repair which only made it worse. So I installed low wattage lightbulb to hide it from the landlord. I got my full deposit back."
"I'm a bloke in my mid-50's with plenty of thick hair. When I'm talking to another bloke that has gone bald, I always run my fingers through my hair and straighten my fringe, just to make them feel bad. I'm usually very kind and considerate in all other ways."
"Whenever I go to unlock my car, I point my key at it like Harry Potter's wand and say Unlockiamus. Sometimes loud enough that people can hear. I'm nearly 50, and I don't even like Harry Potter."
"When I was in primary school, we were asked to write a poem about the first world war. I turned in the lyrics for Don McLean's The Grave"

"I play dream hospital on my phone. I have a good hospital but send the old people home without treatment to die to make room for the young. The receptionist Ingrid is a bitch too, but can't sack her. More exciting than my actual life."
As a 44 year old man I often wonder why most days I continue to consider what my DJ or Hip hop name would be should I make it in the music business. I'm a civil engineer ffs with no contacts or ability to even make it in the music game.
"As 7/7 started I was on the BBC site in an IT lesson. There was an alert about an electrical explosion & a box to leave your details if you'd witnessed it. I, 14 years old and 400 miles away, gave my number. A reporter called who as it emerged it was terrorism put me live on air."
I work as a developer for a large bank. We're under pressure to deliver so we just chuck any old shit code in as long as it seems to work. Testing team haven't got a clue what to test. No wonder banking apps regularly suffer downtime and freeze people out of their accounts.
"My husband is absolutely shit at DIY, I'm watching him patch a hole with loo roll and pva glue. It's making me hot with rage, as soon as he fucks off i'm scraping it out."
"About 12 years ago while in a service desk role I changed an uppity IT customers email signature from a QR code pointing to his boring as fuck website, to a different one pointing to the S&M section of PornHub. I left about 6 months later and it was still the same."
"Encouraged my Mum to learn to drive at 47 by buying her lessons. Worst mistake of my life, she's fucking terrifying behind the wheel. Completely oblivious to every other road user, makes silly mistakes and takes huge risks, makes me question how she passed her 3rd test."
"I can't remember the last time I hugged either of my parents. I'm nearly 40 and love them dearly. But nobody will initiate, even when we've suffered family tragedies. I feel like a bad son, but I prefer to live with that than the awkwardness that would otherwise follow."
I'm a retired fireman. Once when I was on duty I drove the fire engine up a really narrow street with parked cars to pick up the crew from a house. I hit 2 cars. I told nobody and wiped the evidence off the engine. Sorry.
"In my early fifties, i have a scar and indent on my thumb from where my index fingernail digs in when i masturbate. What have i done with my life?"
My neighbour asked me to water/fertilise her tomatoes when she was away on holiday one summer. I'd always forget and make up for it by taking an after-pub piss in her greenhouse. By the tenth day the stench was incredible and tomato plants brown. Obviously I denied all knowledge
"I got my manager fired by using his details on the Till to increase the prices of products by 20p. I then took the extra money, making sure the company stayed even on the books. Then anonymously emailed the store that I was always charged extra by a certain worker. I made £1700."
"I like to wipe my bogeys on public toilet walls to see how often and how well they're cleaned. Turns out not often, 6 months for the closet toilets to where I work"
I was less miserable when I was homeless staying at a night shelter than I am in my current crappy little bedsit in a shitty village in Essex known for its jam.
"My village green has a car park with a collapsible metal bollard at the entrance. My mates and me built a snowman around it. Turned into a great test for wankers - sure enough a 4x4 tried to knock it down, with.much damage done to the car. Don't feel guilty."
"I once got so drunk at a stay-over party, aged 17. I blacked out, woke up the next morning wearing my girlfriend's panties. I had shat all over the corridor of the house, we were all staying at. To this day, I deny it was me but I think everyone knows it was me."

"I've always been bi but seeing how many men on @Fesshole are obsessed with their dicks, shit, piss, cum and where they put them has turned me full lesbian. Thanks Fesshole for helping me find my true sexuality."
I'm in my late 30s and no longer love my wife but I'm terrified if I leave her I won't have a proper relationship with my kids. I've decided I'll put up with a loveless marriage to ensure I'm there for the kids. I can't decide if I'm being selfish or selfless.
I have never ever done the klak klak with a pair of tongs before using them.
I spent absolutely aaaaages trying to get photos printed out for a picture frame. Could NOT find any site that let me print 5x7. Saw LOADS for 7x5. Only copped on a day later 5x7 is for vertical photos and 7x5 is for horizontal photos. It's the same. It's. The. Same.
"I'm a middle-aged dad with a 30+ year track record as a connoisseur of 'credible', 'alternative' music. All of it bores me to tears now, and I prefer to secretly listen to my pre-teen daughter's far superior Taylor Swift playlists when I'm in the car"
"During the night, my baby cried out for her dummy I picked up the one off the floor and put it in my mouth while I laid her down and put a new clean dummy in, I woke up the next morning with the other dummy still in my mouth and felt like I'd had the best nights sleep ever"
"Whenever there's a rocket launch and I'm at my desk, I pretend I'm part of mission control. I also play 'shuttle commander' on flights, pretending to do pre-flight checks and piloting the landing. I'm a 55-year old woman, and never going to stop."
People sometimes ask what my favourite band t-shirt is and until very recently I thought they meant 'banned t-shirt'. I only knew of one so I would say my favourite was the Cradle of Filth 'masturbating nun' t-shirt. I wondered why my answer always got me an odd look.
I often have a glass of wine during my lunch break at work whilst I'm working from home.It makes no difference to my productivity and I get to pretend I'm a cultured Parisian whilst stuck in a studio apartment in Gateshead.
"My lovely gf is the daughter of a famous TV star; & it turns out the childhood crush of my dad.When I told him, the things he said to wanted to do to the mother now mean when my gf & I get intimate I can't help but think of dad & my gf's mother. It proper puts me off my stroke."
"I'm addicted to Football Manager. It occupies my every thought. From how to get the best out of my tactics, to working out my colleagues personalities and media handling styles. I'm totally ok with this."
"I've just spent an hour signing up for free SMS alerts from a variety of sources. Not to my number, but the one on the outside of the white van driven by a roofer who swore at me out of his window."
I once worked for an online retailer who sold over priced personalised toot and when I'm down I go on review sites and read the 1 star reviews to cheer myself up. What's more fun is reading their returns on companies house seeing how much money they owe to creditors!
"Hated my old foreman at work. Last year they were making people redundant due to the pandemic, I went above and beyond to make sure he was one of them and not me. He's now struggling and I've since had a pay rise, it warms my heart thinking of it."
"I often think about doing a small crime, so I can have a 'break' in prison for little while. There is no other chance of escape from my life. Well, apart from ending it, but I think I'll start with prison first"
Convinced the pervy IT guy to let me access my team's emails. I read nothing nice and lots of shit about how needy I was and to stop trying so hard. That'll teach me.

I just ate half a Victoria sponge cake like a sandwich.
"On my 29th birthday in 1990 I was corrected by my mates, in the pub, that 'Vietnam Vets' were not there to look after the animals …"
"Always suspected having an above average vol of ejaculate - ladies' comments, test results when trying to conceive - but the clincher came with the impressed expression of a Brazilian hooker as she held up the used condom to eye level. What better objective judge could there be?"
I've started buying bubble wrap from my supermarket job to line my bin so my neighbours and bin men don't hear how many empty wine bottles I drop in
"As a chef I often get compliments on my vegan and vegetarian dishes, and how good they taste, this is mainly due to the MSG and chicken stock I use"
I'm a doctor who mostly works with frail elderly people. I've stashed enough drugs away at home that if it ever looks like I'm becoming as frail and dependent on others as some of my patients I can check out quickly and painlessly on my own terms. No nursing home for me thanks.
"I'm 51 and I don't know how to boil an egg, I've never boiled an egg and I'm not prepared to start now"
I was inflating balloons with a pump for my girls birthday & made eye contact with my neighbour whilst looking out the window. From her disgusted expression it was obvious she thought I was having a wank. Before I could point out her mistake she was gone & the damage was done.
"My wonderful lab passed away. He was my bestest pal. One night my wife went away and I got so drunk, I snorted a line of his ashes. I felt he'd always be with me..."
At work I was asked to help investigate how confidential data was put in the wrong location so accessible to the whole company. We never found out who did it. IT WAS ME.
I'm always disappointed when my girlfriend doesn't compliment me on my amazing ability to fast forward the ads on Sky and stop at exactly the right spot without missing the programme.
Rereading Famouis Five for the first time since I was a kid and I'm finding that the reason I related to George when I was a kid wasn't just because she was a tomboy but also becuase she was a stubborn little brat who didn't want to share and kicked people she was angry with.
The stench of my bins in this weather has compelled me to start taking my baby's dirty nappies to public bins in parks. I'm sure I've ruined many a picnic.
At a nightclub in my 20s I put my LSD in my pint which somebody minesweeped. Ambulance had to be called and the guy was rushed to hospital. I hope he was OK but to be frank I think it's just karma for nicking my drink.
"I buy birthday cards in bulk, but only scan the cheapest at the self-checkout because it can't tell the difference between the weight of one card or, say, five."
"To the guys three streets over from me who woke up to a pisshead trying to climb in through the downstairs toilet window. I'm sorry, but it's really the council's fault for allowing all these houses and streets to look exactly the same."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something weird with a ford prefect?
"I have three cats, one of which is a tiny stray cat that adopted me a few years ago. Whenever I have a pee in the downstairs loo she will race to jump up on the bowl and deliberately stands under my golden stream getting soaked. She absolutely loves it and I can't stop doing it."
I literally just woke from a dream where I had shat myself in a Wetherspoons that had run out of bog roll. You would not believe the feeling of joy on realising that I had not shit the bed in real life.
"I thought scrubbing behind your ears was a joke, like you need to be so clean, that you even have to do that… I didn't realise you ACTUALLY had to scrub there"
Ran into some dickheads from secondary school and I pretended I didn't remember them because I'd had a car accident in my 20s and lost some memories. Next year is the 25th anniversary reunion and apparently I'm getting a bravery award. FUCK.
"When I hold down the power button on my laptop, watching it struggle to gracefully shut down before the five seconds is up I always imagine I'm choking someone to death"
"I convinced a friend's girlfriend to break up with him by lying and saying he was cheating. Once they ended things, she came to me for the rebound. Worst shag I've ever had. Not worth it. Sorry Nick."
A guy who bullied me at school reached out on Facebook two years ago. We talked for months and he invited me to his brother's wedding as his +1 which I accepted. I stood him up. I never intended to go. I wanted him to feel the humiliation he put me through as a teenager. Job done
Me and my younger brother used to watch Hammer Horror films on our own when our dad was at the pub. We were so scared to leave the living room to go to the toilet upstairs we used to piss and shit on his evening paper behind the sofa and the clear it up in the morning
"When I was a kid in the 80s I was walking with a friend when we found approximately £25 in £1 coins next to a car and picked them up. When walking home later we saw a man on his hands and knees clearly looking for said £1 coins, we walked on by. The guilt has never left me."
My kids are both physically beautiful and people always mention how good looking they are. What they don't know is they are both thick as shit and bottom of thier classes at school.
"I was having an affair with a woman at work, someone saw us in a quiet pub and rumours started, I reported the gossips the HR and they all got in trouble for spreading malicious rumours and I got away scott free"
"In my 20s while using my electric razor, my mind went back to when Mr Bean used his on his tongue with no consequence... I tried it &after a few seconds pricks of blood were dotted all over my tongue & it fucking hurt. At the time I felt absolutely deceived - now, just stupid."
I sometimes listen to a live medley of Ennio Morricone's score to The Mission and imagine that my kids are successful adults in the future and have hired an orchestra to play it at my funeral and I have a good long cry.
As part of my old job I accompanied a frail older man to his bank in an Uber to pay his utility bills. Unfortunately he wasn't used to car travel and chundered copiously. I was quietly furious because I knew this would damage my passenger rating. I never did it again.
"My god daughter came to me saying she got a 2.1 in her uni results. I have no idea if a 2.1 is good or bad, so I responded with a hug and reassuring pats on her back. Got away with it."
"My housemates leave coffee granules in the sugar pot so whenever I make them a hot drink I make sure to gather them up and put them in, even if it's a tea."

"I've told people I've been doing office overtime to save up for a holiday. It's actually because my son has started learning guitar. I'm glad he's found a new hobby, but the twangy, out of tune bullshit is driving me crazy."
"At around the age if 12/13 I showed some of the younger kids on my road that I could lift up a heavy duty metal grill drain cover. Around a month later, one of said kids lost half a finger when it slammed shut on his middle digit as he tried to copy me."
"In secondary school a child stole my minidisc player from my coat before lunch. Skipped school in the afternoon and got struck and killed by a lorry, while riding a stolen bike. Tried not to think he deserved it but he definitely did."
Once had really good sex while watching Bee Movie. Now I get a bit horny whenever I see it
"At 40yo, I have never actually read any contract that I've signed."
Found a wee baggie on the sidewalk with what looked like bit of coke left in it. Nope: pure white heroin. Being the adventurous sort I sniffed a small bump and got a mild high. 20 years later I find I'm oddly proud of having once snarfled random sidewalk drugs.
"I love meat, but I've removed lamb from my diet after watching Clarkson's Farm"
"When I'm riding my motorbike and I pass emergency vehicles coming the other way with their sirens and lights flashing, I wonder briefly if I'm the ghost of myself and I was in an accident 10minutes ago."
"I took a 30 day Racing Tv subscription and then cancelled it at the start of the pandemic. Don't have it on Sky anymore but log in works on my phone, live racing for well over 12 months now. Fuck em"
"As a 44 year old widower I was thrilled but nervous to be asked out by someone 10 years younger. Went for the classic shades on head look, and only when I flipped them down did I realise they were my reading glasses. It would be tragic if it wasn't so fucking awfully funny"
"The best thing about going to a single-sex boarding school? All the gay sex. I turned out straight, but it was a massive amount of fun at the time. 10/10 would recommend."
"I stole an expensive keyboard from work a few years ago. I've changed employer since, but I'm still terrified about the day the police might knock the door if they find out about my crime."
My new cookbook is out in September. I've cooked two of the recipes.
Had the chance to buy a beautifully restored Golf MK1 GTI but couldn't afford it. The local arsehole bought it and is running it ragged with wheel spins etc. Thinking of stealing it so it can have the life it deserves away from that abusive cunt.
"I play crown green bowls, I also regularly use ecstasy. I've had a pill before every Friday night bowls match for the last three seasons. My win record over said seasons is very good."
"I love my wife dearly. But sometimes I fantasise that should she die suddenly, I would grieve by delightfully filling a skip with the pointless ornaments, gadgets and kitchen appliances she has cluttered the house with."

I paid for my first flat by living with three guys in the 90s for several years on a sex-for-rent agreement and saving all my income. Got a three-bedroom flat in Camden and railed senseless for most of my twenties #winning
"Smashed my shoulder up playing ice hockey. Surgery left a massive semi circle scar. Told some new friends it was shark bite for a laugh. Years later, I've a whole backstory about my shark attack, with weather, type of wetsuit, locations etc."
"My photos of some tourist areas on Google maps have millions of views but the woman I took the photos for, never got to see them. I miss her."
"Whenever the weather is really hot, my first thought isn't have the kids got suncream on? or are they thirsty or too hot?, but will my vinyl collection melt in the loft?"
I am a 35 year old male and each time i go out for my morning walk i always salute each cat that i see for good luck. Since i started doing it months ago my luck has changed for the better
"My wife recently gave birth to our first child, I love him so much and after we tried for so long I couldn't be happier… other than 3 years ago I found out I was sterile so I knows she's cheated on me I just never told her out of shame, yet I love him as my own he's my world"
"My ex had a female friend who, whenever I questioned their closeness, he used to say was ugly and not his type. We broke up and years later I've stumbled on his social media and they're now together. Curious if he lied to me or if he's now desperate"
"I've touched loads of paintings and statues in National Trust properties, despite the signs. The more passive aggressive the elderly volunteers are the more touching I do."
The irritation I feel at minor routine changes with a new dog is the best proof I've had that my choice to not have children was the right one.
"I took a parcel in for the neighbours who I absolutely detest. I noticed it said 'Fragile. Handle With Care' on the box so I repeatedly dropped it from a height, and chucked it against my walls. When they came to pick it up I said Mind how you go it says fragile."
"Whenever I stay in a b&b or hotel, I take a screwdriver and a sharpie with me and draw pictures of Bart Simpson doing a poo behind any artwork in the room. I don't know why I do it but it makes me laugh."
My friends found a discarded stewards high vis at a festival in the early 00's & used it to confiscate beer & weed from anyone who looked underage on the camp site for ourselves ALL weekend & got away with it. No regrets
I'm a foster carer. I never recycle booze bottles in case the social worker comes by and checks the recycling bin.
"When we were kids my older brother taught me to fart with my arse against a wall to make it louder. I still do it today, in my 40's."
"My daughters suddenly became popular, since lockdown lifted there's been a stream of teenage girls in our house. Then I overheard my husband being referred to as a DILF and became aware of the hormonal stares at my beloved hunk. He hasn't a clue but these girls adore him."
When I was at college I used to steal my mum's bank card every day and spank it all day in fruit machines. I grew out of it but still use her PIN number with my own card to this day to remind me what a little shit I was.
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something horrible with a zimmer frame?
"Pretty certain my wife only stays with me because I'm useful. If she learns to drive, or how to put the salt in the dishwasher, I'm fucked."
"Not even 30 and already trapped in a sexless relationship, we adopted 2 cats 3 years ago and her libido plummeted. Don't want to leave her because that would mean saying goodbye to our cats and I was the one who raised them. Wish she was cheating, it would be simpler."
"One morning during my school years, I knocked on my mum and dad's bedroom door to feign illness to get out of going to school. To my horror I heard them going at it and mean going at it - my disgust got me to school about half an hour early and I didn't speak til lunch time."
The Sudoku app on my phone has a timer and high score table. When I'm racing to finish a puzzle I imagine that I'm competing in the World Sudoku Championships and commentate it in my head.
To avoid doing a work team building exercise long weekend - building rafts etc - I got my nurse mate to plaster up my arm. HR thought I was losing out so sent me a food hamper as compensation for not being able to go.
In the 90's there was a summer concert at the local National Trust big property. Me and my mate set up a discreet shop in the car park selling cheap champagne and chilled white wine. Didn't get caught but always feel guilty when going to an NT place.
"Whenever I'm watching an old sitcom and there's a quick insert of some old street footage with recognisable shops between scenes, I immediately go on Google maps to see if it's still the same."
My sister-in-law is getting fitter with age. She's older than my wife and far more solvent and I can't help thinking I married the wrong sister.
"I was made redundant from a senior executive job a few years ago, I'm much happier now but still feel sad when I check my emails and there's basically only people trying to sell me stuff rather than loads of people who need help or advice."
"When I worked in a bar, if any customer was rude, offensive or racist to my colleagues, I would step out the back cellar under the pretence of changing a barrel and spit in their pint glass. Never felt bad about it one bit."
"When my wife was pregnant with our first child, we both stop smoking. That was 13 years ago. I had a sneaky fag at the pub 2 years ago and have been smoking ever since. I've managed to keep it a secret so far - the dog gets 15 walks a day."
I regularly stare down the neighbours cat and occasionally cause it to walk away. I'm a doctor and this is still one of my proudest achievements.
I've never once changed a car tyre and am constantly in a state of fear that I'll breakdown on the hard shoulder. I'm almost 50.
"Late 90s, Gloucester. Working alone, late at night in a crap job, for an awful boss, and pissed off I threw a chair at the wall. Had to rearrange all the pictures to hide the hole, next day everyone complemented me on the refresh of the office decor."

When closing any electric operated roller doors I always wait until the last moment to duck under and escape just like Indiana Jones does.
I have no idea whether I'm actually a nice person or if I just act that way so that people don't hate me
"Was at work when I got a call from my sister to tell me that Dad wasn't going to make it, and I should probably get there. Reckon I averaged 130mph for three junctions of the M6, full-beams on to get people to move. Every now and again, someone driving like a dick has a reason."
When I was 14 my mum found the collection of Page 3 cut-outs stored under my mattress. When I got home from school she'd left them all spread out across my bed. We never discussed it.
To my colleague who just got sacked for calling in sick and being caught on camera at the cricket. I'm sorry I sold you my ticket for £20 more than I paid for it. I'm not sorry for pointing you out to our manager. You were shit and lazy!
"My child came out. I'm panicking internally, but I'm hiding it well. It's not that I don't love and accept her, I just worry for what it means for her future. But if I say that, it'll sound like I don't accept her. Parents worry. It's what we do."
If I read a book and don't like the ending I'll rewrite the ending and put it in the book so next time it finishes how I want it to
"Last year, I noticed a stiff hair on the ball of my foot under my big toe catching in my socks. I decided to pluck it. Out came a hair like a wire nearly three inches long that I could feel dragging through the ball of my foot. No idea what it was but fabulously satisfying."
My hairdresser asked me to unhook my face mask and while so doing I somehow managed to elbow him in the penis. We both expertly pretended nothing had happened and I will never go back there obviously.
"I've been using the rosemary my wife planted in the garden for Sunday roasts. Now it's summer, the rosemary bush flowered. I've been using lavender."
Best thing I ever did for my relationship was get us each separate duvets. I never realised how much pent up resentment I had for having to fight over a shared one during the night. Absolute game changer.
"As a teenager i used to borrow cassettes of my favourite bands from the local library, record them on to blank cassettes and then return it. Following day go back in and nick the empty box and inlay."
"I can't follow beautiful/attractive people on Twitter any more. I fall in love with them, to the point I'm far too scared to ever interact with them. It's easier to just follow average looking, chubby folk"
"At a Christmas party a few years a go, I was showing one of the secretaries recent pictures of my dog on my phone. As I flicked through, a selfie of my arsehole I took, to check out a painful heamorrhoid, appeared."
I've gone back to the gym but everything else from pre-pandemic life can fuck right off. I get absolutely everything delivered and enjoy spending time in my house and garden more than I ever enjoyed going out. This is my dream life.
"I watch a lot of science fiction, on occasion part of me wonders if the strangers who glance or stare at me in public are time travelling descendants or even one of my young children as adults."

I used to cut security tags off goods in shops and slip them into mates' coat pockets. Watching them being collared by security after walking out myself was lovely.
My biggest fear is that if I get dementia I'll just sit there shouting my favourite pornhub searchterms.
I've been dribbling in my jeans on nights out recently. To counter act this I have started strategically placing one of the wife's sanitary towels in my pants to soak up any accidents
"I was born and raised in Dorset. Growing up, we always called potatoes tiddies. My partner isn't aware of this regional term and assumes my uncle is a pervert because he once said he was going to get some tiddies whilst he was in town."
"At 13 years old, I found my Dad's porn tapes - obviously I invited my mates round during half term etc so we could watch them. I suddenly stopped doing this and said my Dad had hidden them but it wasn't that. It was because he bought a video camera and a tripod and I was worried"
Tried to live out my teenage fantasy of swimming pool sex. One word / painful and not worth the aggro. Spent more time out than in and could hardly get any thrust. 1/10 wouldn't recommend
Had an eye condition. When finally diagnosed was V painful. Drops would take a month. Asked was there a faster alternative? Pretty nurse says there's an injection. Rolling up my sleeve I confidently say get on with it. Nurse says it's directly in the eye ball. Couldn't back out
"I havent told my wife about my last two promotions at work. I still pay the same amount each month into our joint bank account as I have always done and kept the rest in my own, building up as savings. I'm not sure why."
I'm a barmaid and if you piss me off when you're steaming I pretend to pour spirit in your glass… ring it in the till then drink it myself.. cheers
Whenever I'm hanging out the family's washing I make sure my clothes get the good pegs.
"My mum always used to make me put clean underwear on, apparently it was in case I had an accident, well I did and I shit myself, so it was a bit pointless really"
I recorded my farts on my phone for an entire month. It turns out I use the same main fart... higher-pitched secondary fart format each time. I thought I had more variation that that and now force myself to do varied farts. It's rather taken the fun out of it.
I'm a uni lecturer who loves seeing former students post corporate messages on LinkedIn like so proud to join Mindless as the new drone in charge of ass-kissing - when you know they spent three years off their tits on ketamine and never made it into a seminar once.
"I have a serious phobia of coins/change. Makes me feel sick touching, seeing and smelling it. When I worked in a shop years ago, I kept a bottle of sanitiser under the till and always used it after serving cash payers. Covid making contactless more popular is such a relief."
"My mom liked to come into my room to wake me up in the mornings for college. Sometimes, she'd sit on the side of my bed and play with my hair a little before kissing my forehead and then waking me up. This went on until I was 25 and I let her. I love my mom"
"When I was 19 years old I found an envelope in the road that contained someone's job application form all completed ready to post. No stamp on it though. So I bought the stamp, put it on the envelope and posted it. I occasionally wonder if they were successful."

I sniff my socks every time I take them off. The best sniffs come after a long day. My husband thinks its disgusting but I find it extremely satisfying knowing whether my feet smell rank or not.
As a kid I would flick through the telephone book as entertainment. Coming across the surname Doubles I decided to call to tell them I was The Trebles. Sincere apologies to the Doubles.
"When chromecasting from YouTube onto my main TV, I noticed another TV come up on the options. I'm assuming it's my elderly neighbours. I now regularly interrupt their TV viewing with random silliness."
The one bit of advice I remember my dad giving me when I was growing up was Don't be a dick He recently passed away and I wish I had followed that advice when I stupidly and pointlessly cut him out of my life 15 years ago. RIP Dad.
The only advantage of undergoing chemotherapy and losing all your body hair is discovering the tree really does look bigger when there's no grass around the trunk.
"Whilst having a wank in the living room, I spilt some cum on the floor, and the dog immediately licked it all up. I can't look at my dog the same way anymore."
"Attempted a risky fart at a kids' playgroup yesterday. Long story short, full on shit myself and everyone noticed the smell. Well I was a Dad in a room of mums with their kids, so I said it must have been my son and asked directions for the changing rooms. The shame."
I'm a woman in my mid twenties who recently decided she can't go to bed without watching an episode of horrible histories... mid twenties... I know the theme tune and most of the songs and I can't admit it to anyone. It's not even a flex
"In lockdown, I started gardening & growing my own veg. I get a lot of pleasure from it but I'm now harvesting tiny amounts of veg that tastes nowhere near as nice as supermarket produce."
"Our head of HR's name is one letter off the name of a porn star I used to be very fond of back in the day. One day I am going to accidentally call her the wrong name, and will be fired on the spot most likely"
"The buyers of our house were a nightmare and kept slowing the whole chain down so I ordered 30 old keys off eBay, on moving day I left them on the counter with all the other spare house keys, just so their first day as a homeowner would be wasted trying to find what they unlocked"
"When the kettle needs a good clean, I pop to the supermarket on the hunt for descaler, singing down the aisles 'Scale Away, Scale Away, Scale Away' to the tune of Enya's Orinoco Flow. And now you will too."
Sometimes I flash my headlights to warn people of mobile speed cameras that aren't even there. It's more effective at slowing people down than the camera ever will be.
Neighbour left the card with the WiFi password pinned to their kitchen notice board. I noted it down during a BBQ a few years back and have used their WiFi whenever watching porn. They'll get the knock if it ever gets followed up.
"Managed to flee a beating from a lad 2 years above me once, on the last day of half term. A few days later, his picture was on the cover of our local paper. He'd been killed in a hit & run. Still feel bad about having to hide my delight during the subsequent assemblies at school."
"I work at a new car dealership, whenever I encounter a difficult or rude customer, I ensure the number plates are attached slightly wonky to their brand new car. It's petty but not uncommon practice, so if your plates are wonky now you know why."

I live in a nowhere town in an obscure part of the UK. No reason why anyone sane would move from far away to live here. But my new neighbour has an accent from 400 miles away and I worry he's a nonce with a new ID.
"If I ever go to a house party, I'm the guy who brings 3 Heineken and then helps myself to everyone else's beer."
"I stole some miniatures from my hotel mini bar. On the train back to the airport I ignored a call from the hotel thinking they were phoning about it. They weren't, they were calling to say I'd left my passport in the safe, which I realised 2hrs later when I got to the airport."
"When I got to 1000 accounts followed on Twitter, I thought it was too many. So I decided that I should unfollow everyone in the category of 'I fancy but have no chance with'. I now follow 174, most of which are food outlet accounts."
I convinced my fiancee to buy my wedding ring from Amazon because It was the sentiment not the cost. I secretly bought two more for when I inevitably lose it.
"In 1979 I helped organise my primary school's garden-party raffle in Southwell, Notts. I palmed the second half of the tickets for the best raffle prizes and on the day went back and magically 'won' the two bottles of wine and the box of chocolates. I was 9."
"When they decide they want everyone back in the office full time, they better understand at least two wanks at your desk during the working day is the new normal."
"When I was a teenager I genuinely believed I was the only living thing on earth. Everything around me was a construct, made by aliens to monitor and prepare me for some future moment when I would be required. I'm a hospital consultant, and I'm still not 100% sure this isn't true."
"Having spent the past 16 months only leaving the house to go to Lidl, I have persuaded myself I am having a flirtation with the guy on the self-service checkouts who looks like a 'Doc' Brown from Back To The Future."
I do MDMA and Coke parties at a hotel in London with my husband and select couples. They are loud and sometimes get out of hand. I pay £200 to the concierge to sort out any issues. It is cheap at half the price.
I took a high-vis security jacket to a festival and pretended to be escorting my fake asthmatic friend to the medical tent. He was using a lighter as an inhaler. We were ushered through without tickets and had a lovely time

"My friend and I used to bring back trophies from one night stands at uni. Anything from cd's to blocks of cheese. One time I stole a girl's hamster. My mate was unimpressed and made me go back. Too embarrassed to knock the door, I put it through her letter box"
"I was groomsman at a wedding, the one with nothing to say, after all the speeches people started chanting my name to say something, I declined, the noise got louder so I stood up, got the mic and said Everyone get drunk, naked and have one big orgy complete silence after that."
I wanted to make my wife jealous so I created a fake Instagram account and sent myself a flirtatious message then showed it to her. She thinks I'm honest and desirable. Clearly I'm neither
"I'm 40 and recently moved back to the town I went to school in to raise my kids. I see my old maths teacher around, he used to pick on me and made me cry. Last week, from behind my face mask, I brushed past him and called him a fat cunt. I've felt dreadful since"
"Whenever I have a shit in a public/work toilet, I always put the seat up when I leave. That way, if anybody follows immediately after me it looks as though I've only had a piss and the stench must come from the bloke before me."

I've told my partner I'm losing weight to improve my health. The main reason is actually that I'm starting to struggle to wipe my own arse.
I told my girlfriend when we first met that I had numerous partners before her to not sound like a square. Only to find out she was a virgin so now I've cost myself a really wholesome story and it sucks
"I used to have a secret gambling problem and tried to quit many times. I decided that when I got the urge to bet, I'd put the money in our daughters bank account instead. My wife is now questioning why our 7 year old has nearly 10k in savings whilst we need a new kitchen."
As a teenager I used to steal my father's adult magazines from under his mattress and hide them under mine.He would then take them back without either of us mentioning it
I'm bald but I've got a 20 year old comb which I use to scratch my arse with. My kids found it under my bed and I caught them chasing each other around with it shouting SNIFF IT!
"My Hotmail used to get cc'ed into contract planning conversations for a major international wholesaler. I still received them even after telling the sender they'd got the wrong address, so I once agreed to meet them in Paris to discuss new market expansions"
My 3-year old son got hold of my phone and somehow texted the word 'poop' to the CEO of Moog Music inc.
Until I was 13 I thought 'bird seed' was to grow birds as the name suggested also whenever my mum put it out birds would appear. I tried to prove this theory by leaving some oh my windowsill and sure enough birds appeared that day - my mum thought I was an idiot when I told her.
Had to get my ageing grandmother a Christmas present. I spent £4 on a Primark blanket. They covered her with it when she died. Wish I'd spent more on her.
"When I first saw Fellowship of the Ring back in late 2001 I thought it would be hilarious to say quite loudly in a full cinema pom, pom, pom pom, pommmmm Whenever Gandalf appeared on screen.It did not go down well & I freely admit, I was very, very drunk."
"Worked in a big firm's contact centre and spoke to many public figures. My regular faves were Sir Roger Bannister - such a classy gentleman - and Barbara Windsor. Dealings with Geri Halliwell, however, became known among staff as The Geri Test."
"People who phone my company up to demand a £1 refund I instantly sign them up for as much spam email as possible. They say 'it's not the money it's the principle' stop lying to yourself. Otherwise you wouldn't give me your name, address, postcode and email address."
"In my home office there is a mirror on the wall to my right. Whenever someone says/does something stupid at work, I look at it like it's a camera so I feel like I'm in The Office."
"I had a dream where I was busting for a wee but found a toilet just in time. It was bliss. Woke to find I'd wet the bed. I was 43, wife next to me in bed. I had to get up - at 4am - make a cup of warm tea and fake tripping and spilling it as a cover story."
"I have perfected a really convincing fake snore for when the wife wants sex, meaningful discussion or for me to get up and make tea. The trick to the snore is that less is more."
"Got chatting to a woman in a coffee shop. Sat there talking for hours so when the coffee shop closed, i suggested we walk back to my place round the corner, which she agreed to. However all that caffeine messed up my system, I spent 30 mins in the toilet & killed the moment."

"On my first job application form for a hairdresser junior, under marital status I put used to do karate, I was later told I was successful but that I only got the job based on that answer."
My other half's obsession with TiKTok will be the sole reason for my grounds for divorce.
"My missus is still friends with her ex, so much so he invited me to play with his football team. After my first match I saw him changing and he has a huge cock, at least 5x bigger than me. Now I can't stop thinking about her comparing us. What a downgrade for her it must be."
"Several years ago during a night out, I slipped a pickled onion into the jacket pocket of a friend. He only realised the next day due to the reactions of fellow passengers to the smell on a crowded tube train. To this day he thinks Phil did it. It wasn't Phil. It was me."
"Been thinking about making love to my wife all day and I was so close. She even got changed into something sexy under her dressing gown, but no... yet another evening fucked up by our 5yr old being an arsehole. If you don't have kids already I strongly advise against it."
My friend once cooked this vile dish. I wanted to spare her feelings so told her I loved it. Then COVID and dining at home happened and she now springs this monstrosity at me at least once every quarter. She just told me she's cooking it for me again and I already feel sick.
"My wife mixes with famous people regularly through her work. Know for a fact she's slept with several celebs, but can't bring myself to blame her because if it was the other way round I'd be shagging everyone too!"
"In the weeks before my wedding, began to freak out and rather than be honest with her I hatched a getaway plan, even making it as far as buying plane tickets before chickening out. 11 years and 3 kids later, wish I'd gone."
"Ended my relationship of 13 years today. For many reasons, but one of the reasons was that he shares nothing of us at all on his social media, but shares stuff about himself. He has never made it public. I think he likes people to see him as single. I think it's weird."
"I was bi-curious. Went on Grindr and found a guy to suck me off. They did. I hated every second of it. I'm not bi-curious anymore. No regrets though, I'm glad I'm sure now."
I met my wife on a blind date. Except I wasn't the bloke she was meant to meet. I sometimes think about how different my life would be if a work colleague hadn't stood her up or if I hadn't heard him talking about it.
One time I really wanted to break up with my girlfriend but she had a Crash Bandicoot game I was playing and I wanted to complete it first before dumping her
"My mother in law puts her top-down condiment bottles upside down in the fridge, defeating their very purpose, and so every time I'm at her house, I turn them back the right way, thinking she'll realise that that's why they're designed like that. Still waiting."
I crashed my first car into a wall because a lady in a short skirt was bending over and I was checking out her bum. The car cost thousands to repair and was never quite the same again.
My Mum died 8 years ago and was on a steady diet of the Daily Mail at the time. I miss her dearly but I am secretly relieved that we avoided falling out over Brexit and immigrants. Dad has rapidly gone that way since. They lived in Spain.
"I have not removed my ex-boyfriend as my emergency contact at work, my doctor's office, etc. A part of me hopes something happens to me, he gets the call, and he shows up to take care of me - realising what a treasure I am."

My vibrator packed in when the batteries leaked. I chucked it in my neighbour's bin as didn't want the binman thinking it was mine.
"I shagged my boss, which was an obvious mistake. But on the positive side she ordered Dominoes to my house for breakfast in bed, so it wasn't the worst thing ever."
"I'm not the best hung bloke in the world and it took me until I was 50 before I realised that if I hold my knob at the base when shaking the drips off after a pee, it flops about more and looks bigger. I'm not sure who I'm trying to kid by doing this though."
"I manage a retail store and throw out any CV that mentions horses within their hobbies. Every horse enthusiast I've ever met are weirdos, so why would I work with them?"
"Fishing as a teenager I found what I thought was a stash of drugs, wrapped in polythene & hidden under turf. Hoping for reward I told HM Customs, who asked me to show them. Turns out it was an as-yet-unfinished artificial island for the rare water bird, the Black Throated Diver"
I've been working from home since the start of the pandemic and found it really difficult to stay focused. 
I have found that if I set my workload in to blocks of 4 per day I reward myself with a wank after completing a block.
Keeps me more focused on the job in hand.
"Whilst wearing a mask, I've become accustomed to letting me mouth drop wide open like I'm a fish about to eat all the algae. It feels good, a nice stretch for the jaw and is funny to think of walking past everyone doing such a freaky face when only I know."
"When I was seven years old I used to watch a lot of Allo Allo. I didn't realise how bad the Nazis were. One time, when I was at some friends house, we were walking down the high street and I kept doing Nazi salutes and yelling Heil Hitler. I still shudder when I think about that!"
My credit card pin number has been 1234 for 26 years
It's my girlfriend's birthday next week. I've booked us a table for two. Hope she likes snooker.
We have a biscuit table in the office. I glued the lid onto a tin tube of biscuits leaving just one in it. Every so often some poor sod looking for a sugar rush is found loudly rattling it looking for a treat like a tormented cookie monster.
"I recently decided to stop drinking. Come bin day, when I see the recycling bin only half full as opposed to full, it hits home just how much I was drinking and I'm ashamed of myself."
We once had to reset a computer and Cortana started talking in the middle of the night. I thought it was a burglar and ran out of my room with a flashlight screaming at it to leave. I really felt stupid about two minutes later.
"I needed to pass an exam to get a pay rise, the exam was being invigilated remotely so I cut the envelope open discreetly, looked up and wrote down the answers the night before and resealed it to open on camera. The answer sheet was just out of shot."
This year I got head hunted by a stupidly large company. I'm now 6 months in and still have no clue what the fuck my actual job is meant to be. I just bullshit my way through Teams meeting every week. If I ever have to actually go in I'm done for.
"I'm from London employed in the public sector, I once convinced work to pay for a trip to Australia to follow a lead on a critical new product - I was actually answering a long distance booty call, there never was a product."

"Had to break it off with a girlfriend because she had the same name as my sister. I could cope with the first name being the same, it was when I discovered that her middle name was the same as well that it got too much."
For several years in the mid 00s I was a moderator for one of the largest guitar forums with tens of thousands of users. I gave plenty of advice but was too shy to upload any recordings. I have never even held a guitar.
After seeing super sexy pic of Rihanna in bondage I suggested to my gf at the time we try. She agreed to my surprise. Whole thing was a complete disaster mostly because of my inability to tie knots. After about ten minutes the mood had completely passed and she stropped off.
"I'm pretty good at online video games, and whilst playing I get my kid sister to speak for me and bad mouth the other players. It drives the nerds fucking mental, thinking they are being beaten by a small girl."
"My mum taught me to play Poker when I was 13, recently joined an adult game for the first time, not sure what my mum actually taught me but it definitely wasn't Poker, got out whilst losses were minimal."
"On the train, my bags fell off the luggage rack and landed on a lady's laptop. Broke it. She demanded compensation. Handed her a business card that wasn't my own. Later discovered that she decked him when he denied all knowledge of it. I'm a monster."
"I write gay erotic fiction for a living. The afternoon Richard Branson was flying to space, there's some ironic beauty in the coincidental fact that the last words I typed were virgin asshole before breaking off to watch the flight."
"There is one type of soda that I kind of like, but the rest of family hates. I buy it, instead of my favourite, so that at least I know it will be in the fridge when I look."
"When the men's urinals are being used I'll nip in the proper bogs for a widdle. But for some reason, before I leave, I'll wipe up the previous bloke's stinking piss from the seat if they've made a mess. Like I don't want the next person to judge and think it was me."
"When watching porn I like to imagine I'm the camera man, and when everyone's finished up we all go out for a coffee together and talk about regular stuff."
"I bought my mate's poetry book out of solidarity but I will never, ever read it because I fucking hate poetry."
Someone came round this morning and said I had a nice skin tone. I'd had a bottle of wine before breakfast and was burning up.
"I'm a 46 year old married man, but have recently discovered a love of Power Rangers. I just can't get enough of it and often binge it when my wife goes to bed, deleting my streaming watch history afterwards."
When I'm struggling to edit down to a word count I hyphenate all the words in a sentence and then make the font colour of all the hyphens white. It looks like a sentence but is only counted as one word. A trick that has helped me many times.
"When rubbing my wife's fun zone I always try to make her orgasm to a tune, as expressed through the rhythm of my fingers. Last night she enjoyed Thriller by Michael Jackson."
"My daughter was getting married and I didn't want to pay for the flowers I was using for the table displays because I'm tight,, so I did a drive round the neighbourhood checking out front gardens, then went out at night and got all the blooms I needed."

"As a teenager I got a job delivering junk mail for an advertising company. It turned out to be a lot harder work than expected so I ended up dumping all the adverts in a ravine. It was weeks before anyone clocked on, strangely no-one missed their junk mail."
After my dad died I had to close down all his online accounts and ended up looking through his google search history. The number of times Susanna Reid Legs was searched was alarming but also kind of heartwarming that it was so tame. He was clearly a leg man.
"Whilst shagging my gf up the arse once, I was looking for a compliment for her, as you do, and said Sarah, you feel amazing. Unfortunately, she was called Jane. Pure horror. I played down who Sarah was but she was my ex who I still loved and who didn't ever let me do anal."
"When I drive past a lay-by, entrance to a field, random verge - wherever - and see a man taking a pee, I toot. Not sure how many react but I'm sure I piss a few off with their shoe splashes. Don't do it to women, because women don't take the piss like that and keep things private"
I own and still regularly wear BHS knickers. BHS stores closed 5 years ago and they are probably at least twice as old as this.
"When times are stressful, either at home or at work, I often fantasise about being in a non-fatal car accident or something similar. Just badly exhausted injured enough to need to recover for a long time, quietly, by myself, while other people look after me."
In 1998 I left Australia $1.63 overdrawn in my Australian bank account. God knows what that is now with 23 years of interest
"Work for a mid-size tech consultancy. We outsource a lot of development & design, which is normal. What's not normal, is that we use a legit looking company down in London for most of it, which is actually just me and a mate, spending our evenings secretly coining it in."
"We were broadcasting F1 motor racing for a major channel one night and the costly streaming platform licences expired at midnight, just as the race was starting. One of the guys in support backdated the cloud streaming server clocks to maintain the service."
"Back when I was in school and Fallout 4 came out I blocked my school's number in my Dad's phone and stayed home for a month undetected, just playing fallout. I even left for the bus stop and walked back after he went to work each morning"
"When I was 13 I walked in on my dad having sex with a man. We have never talked about it, but he still avoids looking me in the eye when he tells my mum that he's going to the gym"
"Me and my ex husband were bored one afternoon so decided to pop a few herbal hallucinogens containing Hawaiian baby woodrose. As we were coming up, we got a call from the in-laws who were on their way round for a surprise visit. It was the longest three hours of my entire life."
"Once at work, I took a 15min call from an irate person complaining one of our company vans had overtaken him illegally and he wanted the driver fired.I was extremely sympathetic, claimed we'd investigate the incident, but never let on to him that it had been me driving the van."
When I was young I worked as a shelf filler for a large retailer. One evening I was re-stocking bottles of strawberry bath bubble bath and I wondered if they tasted of strawberries. Turns out they didn't.
I found my mothers gold tipped vibrator on top of the suitcases in her wardrobe. I used it with several girlfriends but I did wipe it before I put it back.
I've spent £100s on Warhammer minis that I've never even assembled let alone painted or played with.

"My partner's favourite photo of me was taken at the depths of my depression. She doesn't know, I hate looking at it."
"Years ago I worked in an office with a rude and objectionable retirement age lady. At the end of most days after she'd left, I made a point of snapping the lead in the pencils she kept on her desk. She used to lament why her pencils were broken. In hindsight I was a cunt."
I nod along/agree with my Mrs when she despairs at the girls on love island when in reality it gives me an hour to look at hot girls in bikinis half my age.
"I wrote a blog over 18 months about my dating/sex life as a single late 20's female in London. I got a few emails from readers, the funniest was from an upmarket hotel who wanted their name removed from my blog after I wrote about a 10 person orgy in one of their suites."

I have found that bathroom sinks in a Travelodge are the perfect height for a man of 5' 11 to comfortably piss in.
"When he was very young at school, I told my brother to ask his teacher to read them the story of 'Rumpleforeskin'. He did and got in trouble for it. I never owned up to my parents that it was because of me."
About 6 months ago I decided to become a yes man at work and not actually give a shit. I've never had so much positive feedback about my work in my life. If I'd have know it was this easy I'd have done it 10 years ago.
"I keep accidentally calling my colleague Ian. He thinks it's because he looks like my uncle Ian, but it's actually because his last name is Brady."
"Daydreaming at work I stepped off a ladder and had a hard fall. I was completely uninjured but so dazed by the surprise my coworkers thought I was concussed. Spontaneously played along, spent the night in hospital, and had a five month paid vacation. Best summer of my life."
"Whenever I feel depressed, I find a YouTube video with no views, watch it all the way through, and subscribe to the channel. I like to imagine I've made them happy."
"Just before we handed the keys over to our scabby landlady, following eviction from a rented property 20 years ago, me and the lads opened the attic hatch and lobbed dozens of eggs into the dark abyss. Hope it still fucking stinks today you twat."
"Once me and my brother were pushing our bikes down a hill. Mine stayed in the road, my brothers veered off and hit a parked car, smashing the rear light. We ran. I then proceeded to blackmail him for the next 4 years of so, threatening to tell my parents."
"I have used upturned traffic cones for a shit on numerous occasions, when caught short and nowhere near a toilet."
My baby makes me incredibly depressed. Whenever I look at her I think that when she gets to my age I'll be probably be dead. It's like having a living death clock.
"Whenever I cook, I pretend I'm on Ready Steady Cook. I talk to Ainsley Harriot and talk him through what I'm going to make. I crack the occasional joke and have my own catchphrase... You can always add more spice!"
"My first job was away from home and my new boss allowed me to stay in their spare room. As a favour, I decided to clean their oven. A bit of clinker fell out and their super-old cat ran off with it and ate it. It died the next day. I kept quiet."

"As a young lad I learned all the words to REMs It's The End Of The World As We Know It, I'd stand in the middle of indie disco dance floors 'impressing' girls by reciting them furiously while dancing like Michael Stipe. What a prick I must have looked. I never pulled either."
"Every now and then I buy bars of chocolate and hide them in my car's glove box, then try to forget I put them there. The forgetting bit is difficult, but when it works the joy I get from finding a Double Decker that I didn't know was there is second to none."
"Working for a recognisable high street brand store, I often check the change for rare coins. Just sold one for £190. Told my collegues I was given the coin whilst shopping in asda. I need the money and wont be sharing"
"Me and my ex split up in May of 2019. Since then, every 3 months, he has been paying for my Xbox Game Pass and I don't even know if he realises. He left me in loads of debt and cheated on me with a man, so I keep it rolling. Wondering how long it'll take for him to notice."
I secretly love the fact everyone is wearing facemasks now. I can drop horrendous shits at work and walk away judgement free as the smell doesn't go through the masks straight away. The extra seconds are crucial for escaping the crime scene.
"Missus has been shitty with me all morning, it's her birthday and I thought she was upset because it's her first one without her mum, who passed away last year. Nope, turns out she's pissed off that I didn't sort out a birthday card and present from the cat."
"Just sat bolt upright in bed with the realisation that a gorgeous girl I was talking to in 1999 was actually asking me out and I never clocked it. Happily married in my 40s, but still kicking myself."
"My parents have moved in with me. I haven't told my mother that the alert when the fridge door is left open too long can be muted, because I enjoy the Yes, I know! You can shut up now one-way conversation she has with the fridge too much."
Aged 15 my parents went away so naturally I had a house party. A very expensive antique lamp got smashed. I propped it up when they came home to hide the crack and the next day the cleaner 'broke' it. She was mortified. I felt awful
"Told my girlfriend if we were married we could split rental income, and she teared-up like I was proposing, so I pretended I was, even though I was speculating about tax. Married 20 years, never confessed"
"My sexual fantasy involves my ex girlfriend, a Catwoman outfit, and a strap-on. Hoping virtual reality can bring this to life before I die."
I work for a big bank and someone accidentally sent me a mail containing highly sensitive takeover proposals. I didn't even read it before HR called and said I would need to be out of the office and not in contact with anyone for 3 months. Result.
"I can't stand my missus when she's had a drink. Her eyes glaze over, her voice goes whinier than usual and she's just an insufferable twat. The next day I have to get away from her before I dump her. Most of the time she's fine as well. Proper Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde."
"I had an online meeting with Michael Gove and a few others recently. While on the Google Hangouts call, it was quite a challenge wank. Still managed though."
"After cheating on me and me moving out, my ex forgot to remove me from her remote heating controls. What an expensive mistake to make that was for her."
Once I was so cross at my wife I went into our bedroom and crumpled up her neatly laid out clothes.
I illegally download films i have on dvd because i'm too lazy to put the disc in the player
Years ago I dented someone's car in a car park and left a fake phone number under the wiper. Today someone did that exact same thing to me. What goes around comes around.
Years ago I wrote a program that simulates mouse movement every 60 seconds. Useful for working from home and preventing Skype/Teams from snitching that you're away... It got a lot of use in 2020/2021
I've been openly drinking on zoom calls. Have a pint of Strongbow dark fruits and telling people its Ribena.
My wife loves my newfound commitment to exercise and grooming. She doesn't know that it's because my first love from 20 years ago moved back to the area with her family and I want to look my best on the off chance I bump into her.
"My wife is worse in bed than any of my other sexual partners but I wouldn't change it for the world. Having a loving, caring relationship with someone you enjoy spending time with and whom you trust implicitly is so worth so much more than a decent blow job."
I work on a supermarket checkouts and when I get rude customers buying Muller Light multipacks I squeeze the pack knowing one inside will pop. Such a shame for the customer when they get home and yogurt goes everywhere maybe they should be nicer.
"I just put in my mouth what I thought was a bit of chocolate that I'd found on the on the arm of the chair, it wasn't. It was cat poo. I am utterly dying. Help."
"I had around £6k credit card debt, no hope of clearing, bit of a millstone round my neck. Suddenly my credit score shot up, it appears the balance has been cleared by some mysterious robin hood who works at HSBC. If you're reading this, you've no idea how grateful I am."
I've had my car for three years and I'm still not sure know where on the steering wheel to press for the horn. I think I have an idea but I'm afraid I might set off the airbag.
"Not good at attention to detail, when I was 13 there was a Lesbian film on late on Sunday night with school in the morning, as I sat up watching this absolute pile of shit thinking there's no action/wank in this I looked at the TV guide again to realise it said Lebanese film"
Used to have 1 password for 13 work applications that only existed in my head. They changed the rules so you need a separate one for each with mixed upper/lower/no's/symbols. They're so complicated none of us remember them and now we have them written on post its on our laptops.
"When I stay in an Airbnb, I always leave a weirdly flavoured teabag in the tea caddy, so at some point a later guest will think what the fuck is this?"
Everytime my neighbour moves my bin I report her for benefit fraud.
I work in a shop and every time a price tag is missing and a customer says oh it must be free then I add £1 irritation tax for shit patter.
"Was in high school when The Matrix came out. I hadn't heard of it so when all my friends raved about it I pretended I had seen it but hated it - to be a contrarian. I loved it when I later saw it, but had to keep pretending I hated it. Then faked a 'reassessment' when it hit DVD."

"I've started printing off stickers to put on car windows when someone has parked horrendously. Not for petty stuff, but e.g. when a car is completely on the pavement and wheelchairs/pushchairs have to go into busy traffic to get past. Totally pointless hobby, but I love it."
"I hated my job so much I donated a kidney to have weeks of paid, guilt free time off. No ragrets"
"On holiday in Italy, I smashed the hire car's side mirror. I didn't declare it when I handed it in. They didn't check, so I got away with it. Next year we went back, and I hired another car. Turned out to be the same car - with the wingmirror still missing. So I complained."
"As a student, I established that First Bus are a bunch of cunts. When I started commuting for work, I discovered Glasgow Airport bus drivers didn't have a way of checking etickets. I bought one and Photoshopped the date for three years."
"In order to tolerate Huel I like to pretend that I'm living in a post apocalyptic remnant, where the last vestiges of humanity fight a long, losing war against a race of sentient self-replicating nanobots."
Remember 'the love test' where you work out if someone fancies you by counting the letters 'L-O-V-E-S' in both your names? I'm 38 and I still do that.
"I'm a married straight male in my 30s and for some reason, watching magic tricks, especially seemingly impossible, large-scale David Copperfield-style ones, gives me an erection. I can't stop it or explain it and it's the reason I hate magicians."
"For years after the 7/7 bombings, I would travel the same route from Leeds to London as the terrorists did: drive to Luton, park, train to London. Saved a fortune compared to getting the train direct. We called it the terrorist route. Thanks for the tip."
"I used my Amazon music service free trial subscription to stream 'Boris Johnson is a fucking Cunt' 24/7 on an alexa device to try and make it christmas number one, I've just discovered I didn't cancel the subscription after the trial. Fucksticks"
I was sent to boarding school aged 9 and to help with homesickness used to play a game in my head recalling when was the last time I thought about Mum and Dad. The longer the gap the better I did. I'm 35 and still play the game.
"I've made a special headset at work, where the left ear and mic are for meetings and the right ear is podcasts or music from a separate input."
Recently discovered that by pulling your cheeks apart to varying degrees while farting you can get a decent tune out of your ass
When I was 19 I served 6 months for possession. Whenever I apply for a job I always tick no where it asks if I have a criminal record. I've had many jobs I should be excluded from but no one ever does background checks
I've grown a beard over lockdown. Not used to having one but like it. Was horrified today during a zoom meeting to see myself stroking it on screen like a stereotypical prick with a beard. Since seeing that I've realised I do it often and forgiven pricks for stroking their beard
In the army in the early nineties and digging a trench somewhere in Germany. My eyes were drawn to something a bit out of place. It was a little ziplock bag filled with around twenty Dennis the Menace E’s. Me and my mates got properly mashed on return to camp.
"I'm an HGV driver with a crane, delivering cabins and containers mainly for building sites, property maintenance in London. Coming out of a really tight site in Roehampton a few years ago I damaged about twelve parked cars. No one saw, so I scarpered, sorry."

I don't normally clean up my cat's vomit right away. She only eats dried food so if left for a day it will return to a biscuit texture that's less gross to deal with.
I'm in my early fifties and have been off the booze for the last 3 months. 
Only reason I've stopped drinking is so I can have a good night's sleep rather than getting up every 2 hours for a wee.
"When I trim my downstairs, I scatter them on our little lawn. We are moving soon, and I chuckle to myself that the new owners will be planting their petunias amongst my pubes."
"At V festival 2008 my friend found a wallet with 40 beer tokens, £600 and 10g of coke in. We split the contents and handed it in reasoning that security would absolutely do the same if we didn't."
"Until the age of 23 I didn't think the word 'Nonce' meant you were a paedophile, I thought it just meant silly or stupid and I had been calling people nonces my entire life not knowing this and nobody corrected me until I started a new job and they explained this to me."
My husband is a crazy Newcastle fan but can't get it up if Newcastle have recently lost a game unless I talk dirty in the style of commentating on a Newcastle game in which they are winning.
On the weekend I drank too much at my favourite pub and threw up all over their hedge. Now I can never go back
"Since the beginning of lockdown, whenever I finish a zoom meeting I always say bye with an elaborate wave to see who else I can get to do the same. It's satisfying seeing the CEO waving like a nob because of me."
"Hot Tamales - the American cinnamon candy - somehow makes my poos a joy; soft, in one piece, one wipe and done, and often that comes up clean. It's not the sort of thing to send in to Top Tips in Chat magazine though, so here it is."
When I was a child I took a photo of my arse in the mirror with my grandparent's camera and they took it to the local chemist to get developed. I blamed this on my brother and to this day still blame him for it. It has been 24 years.
I'm a 47 yr old mum in a reasonably respected public sector job. Working from my garden shed can get boring so sometimes find things to distract myself. This week: harvesting opium sap from poppies out of lazy neighbour's garden. I don't do drugs so not sure why I'm risking it.
I started calling coffee 'natures laxative' as a joke years ago and now it's a habit. In a client meeting today on Teams I said 'why don't we all take a break and grab a laxative' instead of coffee. I was mortified and had to explain to my boss after what I meant.
"Once wore a green and white polo shirt on a night out in Glasgow, didn't realise the implications when I walked into a bar and everyone looked at me like I'd shit on their cat, the bar man told me to sling my hook and I only realised about Celtic Rangers when I got home."
"As a chemistry teacher I was asked to make a colourful display for the corridor. I put up pictures of a fluorine atom, uranium, carbon, potassium, an oxygen atom and a fluorine molecule. No one noticed my display spelled F U C K O F-F. Probably reflects badly on my teaching."
It took me until I was 38 years old to realise that my friends clothes smelled better when I was a kid because their parents could afford nice fabric softener and mine couldn't.
"I work for a national charity. A while ago we got a massive pile-on from right-wing Twitter because we did something perceived as woke. Despite these twats loudly declaring how they'd stop the monthly donations they'd been making for years, we didn't get a fucking penny less."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something charming with a hoover bag?
"My ex and I hate each other. We divorced acrimoniously a decade ago. We cheated on each other all the time. A couple of years ago we rowed about the kids and somehow ended up in bed. We snatch moments now whenever we can. Don't even talk, it's just 100% angry sex"
"When business owners set the bathroom automatic towel dispenser to the minimum length, I always take an extra two towels to punish them for being cheap."
I went for a promotion at work and was rejected. They gave it to an external candidate and I was asked to train him. I turned the ringer off on his desk phone so he never answered it. When he was sacked they told him You never even answer the phone. No regrets.
It's coming up to a year with my current partner and she recently asked me why I asked her out. I told her it was her laugh but the actual fact is I texted the wrong number in the work group chat on WhatsApp. It worked out tho
My parents recently revealed I was conceived at Wembley during Live Aid. They won't tell me where.
"Years ago, I discovered by horrible coincidence, that my ex - who had shagged someone behind my back - had moved into a flat in my building. We had a shared washing machine & dryer in the cellar. Whenever I saw his washing in the washing machine, I set it to boil wash."
"When I bring my wife a cup of tea in bed I always fill it right to the brim. She asks me why it's so full, I say it was accidental, but the real reason is that I pretend I'm on Crystal Maze and if I spill 3 drops whilst carrying it upstairs I'll have to face an automatic lock in"
"At nearly 40 years old, after a lifetime of straight sexual relationships, I had sex with a guy for the first time. It was really fun. People should try it."
"Renting wetsuits with my mates, the guy said You look like good lads who won't piss in them, so have these new ones.Sorry."
My work supplies rented equipment to the elderly. A sad part of this is chasing down the recently bereaved relatives for overdue payments. I recently discovered I'd been sending threatening messages to the son of my great Uncle. My ancestors are looking down on me with shame.
Girlfriend has fallen out with me again because we got into a debate over what weighs more a ton of rocks or a ton of feathers.She refused to concede they weigh the same and We haven't had sex in three weeks since this argument began. I'm sick of it but I'm not letting her win.
"I work in a corner shop, the other day I lost my favourite pen so went looking through the shop's CCTV to see where it was moved from where I last remembered having it. Instead I found where my boss keeps their coke stash in the back room. Never did find my pen."
"My furlough hobby for when I want to get out of the house is responding to few day old or reposted 'free' ads on local Facebook groups. I then take it straight to the tip, 90% of it is unusable tat anyway."
"I've been successfully torrenting movies and porn, but using number 54's WiFi. That'll teach them for leaving their router without a password."
I saw 'Beavis and Butthead do America' at the cinema in 1996. It was only last month that I realised Beavis is referring to toilet paper and not a native American's tent when he says 'TP for my Bunghole'
"I work from home, have done for 20 years. I like to think I am retired already and logging into systems and taking calls is just a hobby I have. I once put a customer on hold while I went and did my weekly shopping."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something sexy with a hippopotamus?
"I'm jealous of people who, despite the indisputable health warnings, astronomical cost, smell and being a social outcast, continue to smoke real cigarettes. I miss it. And giving entirely zero fucks is a laudable quality."
I used the phrase it's like the Krypton Factor with a younger colleague at work and after I explained it wasn't a superman reference they looked at me like I was the oldest person on the planet.
"I'm often complain about having a bad stomach as justification for frequent and long visits to the toilet, whereas it's just an excuse to get some peace from my whining kids. My wife hasn't yet suggested I see a doctor but I'm probably cutting it close."
"Our former IT manager was sacked - for good reason - but had kept a key. We took the good kit home and hastily fitted cameras. Sure enough, he let himself in at midnight and nicked a couple of old laptops we'd left out. He was done for breaking and entering, and theft. Scum."
Had a bookshelf by my bed during adolesence. So i didn't wake up my family i used to masturbate into the pages of some old Enid Blyton books and put them under the bed once finished. My mum then gave these unassuming books to a local school fête.
So my family think I just have a busy social life. I'm actually an escort & have been lying for years.
I left school with 3 O levels. My wife and children have 2 masters and three 2.1 degrees between them yet I am the only one who can stack the dishwasher and know what can or can't be recycled. Apparently I'm the only person who can change a fucking big roll too. Twats.
"I worked for an MP for 10yrs. It was my job to file expenses claims. He was so caught up in the job I used to make claims for myself by forging his signature. When the expenses scandal hit, The Daily Mail went to town on him and he duly lost his safe seat. I never saw him again"
"Having put on weight and never being very flexible, I now can't reach to wipe my arse. After initial panic, came up with a device made from old hairbrush, wet wipes and clips. Works great, I might try to patent it. Surely millions can't reach their arsehole."
"Aged 11, I found brothers pet rat dead and feared I would be held accountable. In a bit to get rid of the body I took it to the back field, threw it in the air and hit it with a tennis racquet. I am amazed how far it actually went and he still thinks that Mr Jingles ran away."
"In primary school I had my elite collection of Pokemon card stolen by a 'friend'. I suspected him and checked his locker to find not only mine, but all of his plus a collection of other desirable kid things. I took the fucking lot. Watched him cry as he didn't dare report it."
"I like to pretend I'm working for the council when I vacuum the house, so when the dog leaves a toy in the middle of the room I will carefully vacuum around it grumbling that it's not my sodding job to move it."
My wife has suggested having her sister - whom I despise - over for a few days so I have invented a training course I need to attend and will spend 3 days lazing about a hotel and working from there instead.
My mum bought me a 6 month subscription to The Sunday Telegraph for xmas 2004. They still send me vouchers. I can't stand the Telegraph but pick it up anyway for the petty win. Reckon I owe them well over £2k by now.
When I was young I used to be scared of going to the toilet at night so I would wee into my toy submarine in my bedroom and empty it out in the loo in the morning.
"I've shoplifted every week since was a kid. I'm now 50 and respected university professor. Sometimes lift small things, sometimes expensive ones. Career would be over if I were found out, I'm a kleptomaniac."

"When the weather forecast gives a wind direction, I never know if it means it's blowing in that direction or it's coming from that direction ie 180 degrees apart. I'm 33 and a Project Management Engineer for the military."
"To cope with the boredom and impatience of the death-zombie experience of garden centre visits with my wife, I now have a quiet dab of MDMA before we go"
"I've slept with multiple foreign people who I don't find particularly attractive, purely to add some countries to the list of nations I've conquered. I'm currently on 16 countries."
"Every Saturday lunchtime my wife takes my daughter to her dance class, giving me 2 hours of the house to myself. My favourite bit of this is not the chance to enjoy a spot of pornography, it's the KitKat sandwich I get to eat without setting a bad example or being judged."
"My daughter's hamster died today. I am absolutely gutted. I loved that little guy. Throughout lockdown I've been at home whilst my wife, a nurse, has been at work. My daughter has been at school. The hamster has been my only company during the day for 16 months. Miss you mate"
Several times a year I look forward to two white hairs growing from inside my nose pointing forwards like tiny elephant tusks. When they appear I make proud excited trumpeting sounds.
"We've been together 20 years & I love my husband, I really do, but am seriously thinking about divorce because his mother never taught him to sneeze properly into a fucking tissue. I HAVE tried to teach him, really tried"
I've been told by various women my come tastes like baked beans and I have no idea why.
Every month when I see my wife's sanitary towels appear I breathe a sigh of relief because I've shagged her all month and she hasn't got pregnant again.
I thought that the Citizens Advice Bureau only provided advice for citizens of a country called 'Bureau' - pronounced 'Baroo'
"I have three children and I regularly change which one of them is the wallpaper on my phone, based on which one has pissed me off the least that day."
Once when I was a teen I was taking out money at an ATM and as I was finishing the guy next to me finished too. I noticed his screen was asking if he wanted to do something else...and let's just say later in the week I finally got a PS2. Sorry random guy in a nice suit
Told my physio I tore my hamstring playing football. Actually did it while tied up and being pegged by my girlfriend. The pain made me forget the safe word so she just kept going.
A while ago someone on here asked if men really wank into socks. I don't know about everyone else but I do. Sometimes I use a tea towel instead. Makes clean up easy. Been doing it for years.
"I've cheated on my wife several times over the years; since working from home and lockdowns I've been having great sex with her again and our marriage has never been better, thank you Covid"

"After 20 years of marriage I hate sleeping with my wife. The sex is great dont get me wrong, its the actual sleeping. I cant spread out, it's too hot in summer and I just want seperate beds. I think she feels the same but neither of us are prepared to adopt the Old People style"
I have made a crude set if Deliveroo and Ubereats uniforms and armed with a cool bag I mock up the order codes I see on the screen in Maccy D's on my phone whilst in the queue . Free meals aplenty! Covid facemasks have reduced risk of staff remembering me considerably.
"I work for a national newspaper where writers are encouraged to engage with readers who comment beneath the articles. It is a daily exercise in self-restraint not to tell the moaning, racist bores what I really think of them."
I once spent 12 hours tied to a girl's bed because she thought it would be hot and a turn on to know that I was there when she was at work. It was so boring and uncomfortable and I regretted it the minute she left the house
"I'm a 50 year old CFO and I spend over half the time I'm in the office watching D&D webshows, so does the CEO. Got a big bonus this year."
"My dog will literally eat anything. Tried him on a juicy bogey just now, he loved it. Makes a change from next door's cat shit."
"Whenever I see a car illegally parked in a disabled bay at my supermarket, I very blatantly key it. People see and either: ignore, smile or give me a thumbs up."
"Back in the '90s I got my own back on a bullying boss on my last day in the job by setting Word on all the PCs to autocorrect his name to Twat. The best thing was that he was a total technophobe, so he would have needed to ask someone else why it was happening."
"We've lived in our house for 7 years, but 9 times out of 10 I still go to the wrong cupboard when I want a packet of crisps."
"For years, I didn't know if people over 40 could jump, because I had never seen an over 40 do it."
"I'm 50, and I've only just realised that peeing loudly is not impressive. My toes are curling at how many dinner parties I've been to where I've made sure to hit the water with a full force."
"When I was in sixth form, I used to hate a teacher to the point in which I'd carry round a suicide note blaming them in case I was ever found dead. No suicidal intentions, just hated them."

I think I am addicted to twitter and it is getting in the way of everything even TV and other websites
A few years ago my wife and I agreed to have an open relationship. One of the rules is that we don't talk about any sex we have elsewhere. In that time I've managed one drunken handjob in a nightclub toilet. Hope she's had more success.
My wife can't process the concept that I'm sometimes not really thinking or feeling anything at all - so I have to exaggerate trivial worries or woes to 'explain' my non-existent 'mood'. She's now trying to persuade me to talk about these things with a therapist.
"If I ever post something on Facebook or Twitter that gets a lot of likes, I meticulously go through the photos of every female person who liked it to see who is more fanciable than my wife."
I've had an irrational mistrust of the top-left burner on every hob I've owned. I avoid using it all costs. I don't know why.
I work at the Driver Theory Test Centre. When I allocate people's seats I always sit people who'd make a cute couple next to each other to make a meet cute happen. I'm the Theory Test Cupid. I have a moderate success rate.
"Just packed some hay-fever tablets in foil for my son to take on a school residential trip, took all my effort not to fold it like a wrap of speed."
"Whenever I fart, I raise my leg to do it. My wife hates it and it's putting an unnecessary strain on our relationship but I can't stop. It's become some sort of OCD response. I genuinely think I need counselling."
"When I watch films multiple times where bad things happen , a small part of me thinks, maybe this time it'll be different. Sadly, every time they still end up with their mouths sewn to each other's anuses."
Whenever I buy my parents a present I always make sure I also want it because I see it as only a loan until they die at which time I'll be getting it back
"At high school, I had a teacher who was in the habit of writing a colon followed by an em dash on the board, like this  :— . Always used to think it looked like a stick person's cock and balls."
"If and when my beautiful wife acts like a nobhead, I've got a couple of go-to's to get my own back. My current favourite is referring to the dresser in the dining room as a bureau. I know it's not a bureau, and I love hearing her shout 'it's a fucking dresser!' across the house"
"The 90s fashion revival freaks me out. Teenagers now look like they're cosplaying me, my mates, and all the people I used to fancy when I was their age. It's like living in an historical reenactment of your youth. I'm sure it triggers loads of mid-life crises"
My wife asked why I was so down and if it was something she had done. I told her I was struggling at work - it's actually because I realised I am now so old that I have had to retire from professional football in my own daydreams. Sad times.
"I took a dump at my posh girlfriend's parents' once. Went to wipe my arse and the light cord got caught up in it, and I did my trousers up. As I went to leave it really hurt and left a brown cord"

"I was an usher at a wedding and directing people to their tables. One couple turned up and I couldn't find their table, so jokingly said looks like you weren't invited. They walked off and I've never told the groom, so might have cost them a couple of friends or family members"
"Every time I book a restaurant, I say it's my birthday. Free brownie desert every time."
"When I was 10 my mum discovered porn magazines under my bed, she went ballistic and demanded that I get rid of them right away! I said I couldn't and when asked why I advised that they belong to my dad."
I consoled a heart-broken friend by quoting verbatim Phil Oakey's monologue from Human League's 'Louise' without telling her where it came from. She now thinks I'm a sensitive genius.
"My wife went away for the weekend for the first time in months, recently. I initially wondered why my toothbrush was missing. Turns out mine is the green one."
"During our honeymoon in Thailand, my then wife wanted her hair braided. I got bored and had a massage at the same premises in the room above. It was a proper massage place but the masseuse was hot. She ended up giving me a handjob in earshot of the wife. It was electric."
"I dreamt that Danny Devito had died, had a little cry. Didn't check and was sad all week until I mentioned it to a colleague who corrected me. So releaved."
"A local driving instructor posted on Facebook how people abuse him for letting student practice parking around their cars! I replied saying he could use mine no problem and to DM me, he did and was so grateful as I gave him my neighbours address and description of car."
When I was a junior doctor I had a patient with lots of neo-nazi tattoos. When I had to put a drip in him I found the biggest needle possible and made sure I missed twice before it went in.
"My partner never changes the toilet roll on the holder, but is annoyed enough by the roll being on backwards that they'll take it off and change it. So I put it on backwards every time."
"In the mid-seventies I pooed my pants close to home. Having made it back a la John Wayne, I deposited the whiffy contents in a carrier bag and ventured back out to dump the undies in a neighbour's hedge. I'd like to apologise to that neighbour. I should have used a bin."
"Bought first house. Moved in. Day two realised my neighbour was a teacher from school I hated. Turns out, he's sound. Lends me garden tools, gives me bottles of his home brew, doesn't moan about noise. Sorry for glueing your mug to your desk when I was 15, Mr Jones."
"As a kid, bunking off school one morning, my mates and I nicked some 1/3rd pints of milk for the kids out the school yard. We then went to the neighbouring houses' doorsteps and swapped them with the full size pint bottles that the milkman left. Apologies to all parties."
"I went to the loo for a wank and accidentally hit the chromecast button on the video I was watching on my phone. About 10 seconds of hard anal interrupted Homes under the hammer on the lounge TV, which my wife and dad were watching. Nobody has mentioned it since."
"My wife convinced me to try letting her peg me last night. Got to say, not a fan."

A few years ago I broke my nose because I walked into a lamppost. I was distracted by a woman walking past in see through white trousers with a very visible black thong
"I get a fair amount of earwax build-up around this time of year. This, combined with my home working arrangement, has given the corner of my dining table a gorgeous dull sheen."
"When I've finished using the machines at the gym, I always increase the weights so the next person will think I'm stronger than I really am"
"For a surprise I randomly bought a dress for my girlfriend online, thought the sizes were in age groups and bought her a 22, didn't go down too well as she was on slimming world at the time trying to go from a 14 to a 10."
When I was a teenager the police were out looking for someone smashing house windows. It was my friend and I trying to shoot the carrot nose off some snowmen and didnt know the pellets were passing through them. Sorry.
I told a little porkie at interview and am now a Marketing Manager with a team of execs under me. I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing and have discovered that 99% of management is letting people assume you know what they're talking about.
"Whilst waiting at the garage for a new tyre, I received a dirty video from my missus. I couldn't make out why the audio wasn't working until I realised that it was blaring out my car speakers. Now I need to find another garage."
There's nothing I love more than farting in my dog's face. The louder the better. He always acts really surprised like it's never happened to him before. I think secretly he loves it.
I regularly swap organic eggs for battery eggs in the supermarket
"There's a guy at our poker games who always calls the jack the knave, the king of hearts aha, yonder lies the heartlord and similar shit, ruining all my idle fantasies of being an old west cowboy. He's such a bellend, I want to smash him"

"I run a Recruitment business, which could be a confession on it's own, but there's more. We have a standing order to delete any applications made during England matches without reading them."
Burnt the tip of my finger which led to a blister about the size of a 5p. Left it for 2 days then pricked it with a pin. The 5 secs that I spent squeezing the liquid out like a tiny water pistol are among the most joy filled I've ever enjoyed. Everything is downhill from here.
I'm certain that time travel is possible. I'm sure I've seen my future self checking in on my current self at least 4 times.
The best man speech I gave for my bro's wedding has gone down amongst all the 200+ guests as the best ever. 10 years on & ppl still talk about it and I still get kudos. Truth is I pretty much plagiarised it word for word from a wedding I went to with an ex. No one will ever know.

"After seeing a few Fess' about owning a dog leading to affairs/casual sex, I recently bought a dog. Unfortunately the only encounters I've had so far having been with middle aged men with nicotine stained beards talking about their cars."
"My manager is a lonely and needy person and since we've all been working from home he calls me for at least 2 hours everyday. Always on the pretense of a work related matter, but invariably ends up talking complete bollocks. I wish he'd fuck off, I've got decorating to do."
"I once accidentally texted I'm upstairs, I'm naked and I'm horny to a man interested in buying a lawnmower I had advertised."
"Got sacked from a job pre covid as I totally zoned out in a performance review meeting. Came out of it and saw the stern look on her face but didn't hear the question. Some reason I just said yes. She actually asked if I was staring at her breasts. Reported me to HR, instant sack"
"At my wedding, my head bridesmaid did a speech. She started off with I'm not going to tell the story about Beth, when we went to a Killing Kittens sex party together. Not a soul knew, I nearly died in front of 60 guests."
When my parents were away I once broke a TV by punching it because I lost a game of fifa. I turned the TV off and stay at a friends until they got home. My sister got the blame and had to pay it back with pocket it money. Sorry sis.

"Was in the Co-op last night, bloke in front of me wasn't wearing a mask. When he left he dropped a fiver. Said nothing to him and told the girl at the till a little too late for her to call him back."
"Whenever I drive my wife's car, even if it is just to move it off the driveway, I always change the seat position, alter the steering rake, re-adjust all of the mirrors and change the channel on the radio."
"A few years ago I was walking in my town, I saw 2 lads under a bridge that looked like they were fighting and I thought it was just a heated argument and walked off. I later found out that there was a fatal stabbing at the bridge when I got in. I could've stopped it, but didn't."
I ordered room service while on a work trip. I thought to myself that I had never eaten a meal completely naked so this was my chance to give it a go and managed to scald my knob with some hot sauce.
"I was the maintenancy engineer for public pool - Olympic size. Most people gag at the filter cleaning and don't want deal with the plasters, grit and skin. A couple of times a year I would sift and find diamonds that had fallen out of rings."
Bloke in pub once brought two dodgy DVDs. One to watch with his family the next day and an adult film to watch alone. The DVDs were unmarked so swapped them over. Hope his elderly mum enjoyed Throbin Hood
"I am such an anxious person that I was too scared to ask to use the toilet at my best friend's house when we were 12. I pissed myself, ran out of the house and only spoke to him to say I didn't want to be friends. He moved schools because he was so sad."
"In the 90s, Safeway had an offer, spend £100, get free tickets to Alton Towers, I quickly realised that you just had to send in receipts totalling £100 rather than actually spend money, so I went round the car park picking them up. Went to Alton Towers 5 times. Cheers Safeway!"
"We’re on hols (Yorkshire, it’s v nice) & yet still logging in to the spreadsheet to moderate what confessions go live on @fesshole - so if you fancy bunging us a few pennies for our commitment to content as we sit in a rented flat in the rain then thanks: https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"When I was 16 and on holiday, I met a stunning, older Swedish girl who I went skinny dipping with. She then went to the toilet and asked me to hold the door closed. Only at 20 did I realise she wanted me to come in with her for sexy times not stand outside holding the door"
"After skiving at art college I'd done almost no art so took some cast offs from a guy in my class to show my mum, who'd paid for my course & wanted to see my portfolio. She thought 'my' art was great. 25yrs on she still has some framed on her wall & talks about my artistic talent"

"I went on a lads holiday to Amsterdam, and got enticed by a working girl in the red light district.Nerves got the better of me, so it was just her playing with my floppy cock for half an hour."
"Matched with a girl on tinder. After reading her profile, at the end it said ''I am deaf''. Opened with ''sorry to hear you're deaf'' and hit send. Immediately realised my mistake. She blocked me and I felt awful."
"I had a one night stand & next morning I saw that my grandad was in some photos on display in her flat. I asked how she knew him, & she said he was her grandad but was estranged & she only saw him a few times. That's how I learned he had a second family, and I an incestuous shag."
"For a period of about 3 years, in the any special requests? box on the chain business hotel booking form, I would request a photo of Luis Suarez. About half would do it and only once did someone come out from an office to tell me they couldn't"
"I always stay at the same hotel whenever I'm in London on business, because the first time I ever stayed there I had sex with a random guest I bumped into in the lobby, like in a porn film."
"It wasnt destiny or written in the stars, It was the sad look of pity the woman on the til at John Lewis gave me whilst buying just one bed pillow that inspired me to sort my life out resulting in me meeting my wife."
I used to work at a supermarket and would be called to help on the tills. I wasn't the healthiest and didn't know what alot of the veg was. So if anyone bought anything other than a cucumber or tomatoes I would just give it them for free rather than having to ask what it was
"In 1985 I got a job picking strawberries in my Uni summer holiday. Whilst rooting around, I found a large gold coin sitting exposed in the soil. It was a Henry VII Angel - trousered it and still have it today. It's worth about 4k"
"During a recent visit to an animal park, I went up to an empty enclosure, pointed and yelled look! to my husband, to lure away some annoying children who were looking at the animals I wanted to."
I am policeman and I travel from pokestop to pokestop instead of investigating crime in my area.
One time I didn't pursue dating a woman because she had a carpeted bathroom and I just couldn't face definitely pissing all over the carpet
I once cut slits into my eyebrows as a child and when my parents asked why I'd done that I told them that I'd run into a door handle at school and the hairs had fallen out.
Every year I send my parents a Christmas card from a made up family and they have the same discussion every year about how they may know them and they feel bad that they never send a card back. Been doing it for 15 years now and won't stop
"While renovating my cottage in Devon, I found a cache of love letters from the thirties under a floorboard. They were filthy and made me blush. I put them back when I finished the renovation."
"As a child I was impressed by my dad farting on every step as he walked down the stairs, 30 years later I do the same, realised he didn't mean to do it & it just comes with age; my son is now impressed by me; I won't break the circle of truth and will let him learn himself"
I occasionally photoshop a pair of eyes onto a tree and post it to social media claiming it's an owl. Always makes me laugh when people go on about the amazing camouflage.

"I thought my husband was having an affair, but he was actually going to a model trains club. Almost rather he'd been having an affair."
"Fit secretary used to bend over the photocopier alot. Instead of watching, I'd sit facing away and catch whoever was on the desk opposite ogling her bum and watch them go bright red."
"I often walk along the street with my thumb to the side of me, upright. Whenever I turn a corner I like to pretend I'm controlling a motorised wheelchair and move my thumb to the left / right accordingly."
"When I travel with work I always make sure I'm wearing my best underwear and leave my hotel room tidy, just in case I get lucky and bring a woman back. I never do and never will, not because I can't, but because I love my wife and won't cheat on her."
"My boss is a bully. I sign him up for PPI, Home Solar, Accident lawyers etc - he is bombarded with calls 7 days a week. He thinks he is on a marketing list. The office falls about laughing when he loses his shit."
My first job involved feeding cheques into a huge machine 8 hrs a day. Needing to watch a World Cup match one afternoon I put a penny into the mechanics of the machine. It was broken for a week.
I wanted to try role-play with my boyfriend so I got dressed up all sexy and waited for him to get home from work. One of his friends came in to get some of my boyfriend's things for him. Best fuck of my life and he's going to be the best man at our wedding.
I would have never dreamed of pissing in the shower. Then I watched Big Brother 3 in 2002 and a lad called Jonny did it all the time. I've been doing it ever since. I even hit the shower curtain sometimes by accident.
"At my first interview for a primary school teaching job I was asked, We know about your strengths, but are your flaws or weaker points? I was a bit nervous and told the panel, I'm a very selfish lover. Didn't get the job."
"I sometimes eat slices of my wife's Quorn ham straight from the packet for no other reason than, I paid for half of it."
"When I used to do in-person interviews I'd always try and catch a glimpse of the interviewee's socks. If I could be sure they were an odd pair, I'd conclude the person was disorganised. Sometimes swayed my decision."
"I was once delivering newspapers on my bike. The bag I was using was split and the papers rubbed on my back wheel, smearing dog poo on every one. Too scared to go back to replace them, I delivered every last one, including one to the bosses wife."
"As a kid in the 80s I regularly bought albums on tape at Woolworths, took them home, recorded them onto a blank cassette on my double tape deck and then took them straight back for a refund. Saved hundreds of pounds."
I get far too much amusement from beeping random people and waving as I drive down the road as if I know them. It's always the half hearted wave and confused face that does it for me. Little things.
After I left home I spent 5+ years washing my clothes with fabric softener. I was filthy but smelled delightful.
My 14 year old daughter smokes. I give her cigarettes and lighters. I feel like a bad dad but I'd rather she got them off me then anywhere dodgy where god knows what they'd put in them.

"The publisher of the PS2 game I was working on threatened to pull funding if the game didn't maintain a steady 30fps. It ran at 20 at best. We couldn't optimise it any more so eventually just wrote some code that added 10 to the FPS counter. They were happy, game shipped on time"
I once tried to impress an Italian girl by making her pasta. And that's as much as I can bring myself to say without having a panic attack.
I created a spoof tinder account last night posing as Matt Hancock. I already have more matches than I've even gotten on my real accounts.
"When replacing some leased office equipment, the old equipment accidentally ended up in the tip, when the company came to collect the old equipment, I boxed up 4 breeze blocks making sure to cut and re-tape the underside of the box so it appeared to have been stolen in transit."
I don't think I love my husband any more. It's not even like he has done anything. It would be easier if he had then I would have a reason. Maybe this is just what it feels like after 15 years of marriage.
"I used to share a house with a guy who had a knack for leaving skid marks on the toilet seat. Fed up of always having to clean them off, I eventually started using his toothbrush to do it."
I'm a policeman and I sell weed to my sergeant.
"My four year old is my best friend. My wife thinks its weird, but my adult friends just sit around fucking moaning about jobs and house prices. All my kid wants to do is play Lego all day. I know which I'd rather do."
"My partner has very stubbornly had the same extreme haircut for over a decade. It's so unflattering, ugly, and stupid looking now that we're both in our 30s I honestly don't know if it's something I can put up with much longer."
"Left my job two months ago, a massive world-wide company with 5,000 employees and they are still paying me. What do I do?"
I have a serious addiction to Financial Domination.
"I cannot explain why, but being made to give all of my hard earned money to a beautiful Goddess gives me such a huge buzz & makes me feel amazing & alive"
"Many years ago I was playing a football video game with a much, much younger cousin. He completely rinsed me. We are talking 19-0 here. After he was so happy and told his mum, my aunt. She took me aside and said 'thanks for letting him win'. I said 'no bother'"
"I stole my neighbours fancy show cat and collected a handsome £1,500 reward after 2 weeks of it being missing."
"Whenever I hear or even think about Parklife by Blur while at home, I end up singing Aparteid and then the rest of the song in a South African accent. So lucky it's not happened in public. Yet."
"I've become a better cook overnight, so much so that my wife brags to her friends and family about how much I've improved. My secret? I sprinkle some good old MSG on everything. Works a treat."
"I send my nieces, nephews and godchildren Amazon vouchers every birthday and Christmas. I write down the code and if they haven't spent them within 6 months I use them myself. I usually get about half of them back. Ungrateful little shits."

In the late 90s I used to read a lot of Barney the Dinosaur fanfiction. Seriously dystopic stuff. Now I kind of want to read it again but wonder if it was actually legal cos it was that indecent
When I sign petitions that are anti-Tory I always use a postcode from very posh parts of London. I like to think it stings them more.
For years I've been entertaining my colleagues with tales about a friend who visits prostitutes and massage parlours. I am that friend.
I couldn't bring myself to take my ginger kitten to the vets to get his nuts chopped. 11 years later he's still packing some of the biggest kitty balls I've ever seen but I take greater pleasure in the fact that my neighbourhood has so many ginger cats now. I'm such a proud dad.
A few years ago a trendy bar opened near me attracting all the young hipsters. I found I could access the WiFi from my flat and get into their soundsystem so every Friday night as I had nothing better to do I would hack the playlist and stack Phil Collins songs on loop for hours
"I had worms as a child in the 80's. It was absolutely vile and my family had to drink revolting blackcurrant shit. After that each night I'd pray please God, don't let me have worms I still say it every night without fail. It must work because I've not had worms since that day."
"I worked in specsavers in the early 00s. After a heavy sesh the night before, I'd always turn up hungover on Saturdays. I made sure the first few appointments were already taken by imaginary customers so I would have an easy morning. Peter Purves was a regular non-attendee."
I won our work lunchtime quiz today because we are all working remotely so I can just search online for the answers. £20 Amazon voucher.
"If I see a van driving dangerously/selfishly, I take a note of the name of the company, look up their accounts on Companies House, and report them to the Serious Fraud Office, pretending to be an anonymous internal whistleblower."
"When eating Sushi, in public I use chopsticks to show everyone how cultured I am, but in private just use my fingers."
"I once came home drunk and vomited on my neighbour's doorstep - which is separated from mine by a small wall. I had to try and wash it away by pouring jugs of hot water onto their doormat while pissed. Next morning, I saw their cat nibbling at the bits I'd left."
"Whenever I take eggs out of the box, I have to ensure that the remaining eggs are arranged symmetrically, so as to ensure perfect weight distribution, otherwise I am convinced the box will collapse. Other than this, I consider myself a rational man."
I'm an Irish speaker in a very loyalist part of Norn Iron. Back in uni I used to write to my local council annoymously and request government documents be translated to Irish which they had to do. As the only Irish speaker in the area they came to me. Basically paid for my uni.
"A few years ago I saw a really nice M&S salad in the works fridge.I can't explain why, but I took it and scoffed the lot. Later, a colleague complained to me that someone had nicked her lunch & how appalling it was to be working with thieves. I shook my head, tutting in disgust."
"My Dad was a graphic designer & pro airbrusher for the publishing industry in the 80s and 90s. He only recently told me that he secretly airbrushed Wally out of my Where's Wally book, which explains why I could never find him!"
"Every now and then I get angry when I think about the time, aged 9, my team came last in the school relay because the guy on the leg before me forgot he had to give me the baton. Really fucks me off to this day. I'm now 47"

"I saved £700 by not going to therapy and used the money to buy an expensive phone. It's no better than my cheap phone and my issues with trust, futility and hopelessness are stronger than ever."
"I claim to be a closeted, married dad on Grindr. I've never married, have no children, and have been out and proud since I was 16. I get loads more sex this way."
"I bought a re-possessed flat in London, it was like a nice couple had just left for work and hadn't come home one day. Their home made porn collection they left on an old hard drive is better than anything on the internet."
"Whenever I get a bad Google review for my cafe, I look them up on LinkedIn and complain to their company of some wrongdoing from their hand."
"Had the noisiest neighbours ever at my last house. Utter bastards. When I moved out I downloaded a baby screaming mp3, left it playing on a loop at full blast, and kept paying the electric bill. Five months later the absentee landlord phoned to berate me when he discovered it."
"As a boy, my ambition was to become a market stall trader, as I used to love the way they jollily twirled the brown paper bags around which contained our weekly fruit. I'm a civil servant now…I think I made a wrong turn"
I was in a minor prang; bloke reversed into me at the supermarket. I was hounded by accident solicitors into making a claim even though I wasn't injured and told them so repeatedly. They twisted what I said and virtually forced me to claim. Got £2k and still feel like a crook.
I had a Casio remote control watch that i used to torment my neighbour with by turning up the volume on their TV from outside their front window. They couldn't figure it out & got a priest in to bless the house. I stopped after that.
My boyfriend is writing a book. I am sick of hearing about it and couldn't give a shit. Publish the bloody thing and shut up. No one will buy it anyway. It's boring and rubbish.
"I saw an unethical life hack on reddit about collecting business cards of people you don't like and writing sorry on one when hitting a parked car, well today I used it, should save me a few quid"
Nearly a year ago I got a rep as a spreadsheet nerd by googling formulas and macros. Got asked to make a timesheet for the office. It's ripping people off by an hour a week for some reason. No one's realised yet but they will and I'm too scared to fess up.
"Because of The Young Ones, I used to think that the setup of the desks on University Challenge were on top of each other. I was in my 20's when I realised they were side by side."
I used to work in retail and used someone asking me to check if we had something in stock as an opportunity to have a wank in the staff toilet.I never checked the stock. NEVER.
"I sometimes buy the pot noodle flavour my ex gf used to get. And when I get home I sit and eat it and think about our time together, and have imaginary conversations with her. It's sad but I miss all the little things still, and how I don't have that anymore."
My friend has a cat who has Insta & FB page & is the only topic of conversation ever. The cat has birthday parties we must attend & a wedding to a neighbors cat ahead. I now think it's concerning & how do I bring this up to her in a calm way? It's exhausting for everyone

"I've stopped going out for meals with someone I know after they established themselves as a poppadom smasher when we last went to a curry house. I'm sorry, who the fuck are you, smashing up everyone's poppadoms?"
"I asked The Wife if we should try for another baby as I couldn't be arsed selling the baby car seat. Didn't think it'd happen, but fun trying. After one month's worth, baby due in 4 weeks. Should've cleared the garage."
"I'm a plumber and once had the cliche porn scene where a customer said it was more expensive than she expected and couldn't afford it I was expecting a shag or at least a blowjob instead she offered me her coupon booklet and a homemade cake, I told her I could wait for the money"
As a student I lived in shared house with my gf and 5 women. One day someone laid a caber in the toilet so big it couldn't flush and coiled to the top of the bowl. As the only male I took the blame. But it wasn't me. Still waiting to see the confession on here one day.
"At school we had a teacher that all the boys fancied. 2 of my classmates were behind her & one spanked her arse. I was the only witness. When asked who it was, I lied & said it was the one who had bullied me back in primary school, even though he didn't do it. He got expelled"
"On a tour a couple dropped my bag in a puddle, soaking everything. No apology so at breakfast I stole the couple's phone chargers. Middle of nowhere, no shops, and as nobody would lend them any they spent the holiday bickering about who'd lost them."
"When inserting a tampon, I like to sing tamp-in, tamp-on, to the tune of eggs in, eggs on in the Birdseye Potato Waffles song"
"When people ask me for help with Excel the first thing I do is change all the formatting to look how I like it. Deleting rows and columns, changing fonts etc. If they complain I get up and walk away."
A 'mate' from a band I was in at Uni 30 years ago got in touch. In his mind we were a 'Band of Brothers' and it's become a major life event for him. We never played a single gig and we were permanently on the point of sacking him.
Thought I'd give manscaping a go. Ended up shorter than I was intending. Reckon my wife of 20 years will think it's weird so I'm avoiding letting her see me naked until it grows back a bit.
I've always fancied doing an emergency tracheotomy on someone with a ballpoint pen like you see them do in the films. I have no medical training but I'd like to give it a go.
My husband had an affair for 18 months with one of my friends. My secret revenge was organising a fake girls weekend away where I met a couple for for sex.
I work on the 1st floor and have an opening window for fresh air. People smoke outside the building under my window. I enjoy overwatering my window box geraniums which accidentally extinguishes the cigarettes.
I'm a 50yo man and I've only just discovered the pleasure of cuddling a pillow as I fall asleep.

"In primary school me & my mates used to pick on this kid because we thought he was a prick. Felt terrible about this for years, because tbf, all kids are pricks, me included. However, many years later I found out that he became a paedo so now I'm glad we got our bullying in early"
"I once had a one night stand with a colleague, we had dinner and then spent a night at a hotel. At dinner I found a wallet with £700 in it in the restaurant toilets and kept all the money. Although the sex was amazing its finding that money that I still fantasise about."
"Old prick who lives across the road got in an argument with my mother, made her cry. Next day I noticed he left his front door open when he was in back garden, I entered quickly and stole one shoe from each of the five pairs neatly lined up in the hall. Still feel great about it"
"Went to Cambridge to visit a friend at Uni. Threw an egg from a rooftop walkway, slam, into the back of a student's head below. The thrill of running through the night time alleyways, chased by a pissed off, egg soaked student and a porter will stay with me for life."
"I've owned my car 5 years. When I'm at the petrol station, I'm stood by the pump when I remember the lever to open the petrol cap is located under the drivers seat. Nearly every single time."
"When my mum started to loose her marbles, I used to take her to the supermarket to do her shoppping, made sure she wore her red and white hat so we could play real life, where's wally. Sorry mum"
I cycle head on towards low hanging branches and duck them like I'm in the Matrix. I feel so cool
"My girlfriend started an onlyfans during lockdown, I don't have a problem with that, till she uploaded a picture of her playing with my cock. The comments were unkind at best. The ones about the length of my nutsack have given me a complex."
"I use the 'Focus' functionality in MS Teams to block out time to play Mario Kart and Bloons TD6. I reject meeting invites that intrude on that time, ignore calls from the people I manage, and being selfish has improved my mental health."
"In the days before Oyster cards on London buses, you could buy a week of single ride tickets. But the driver almost never checked or took them from you. So for about 7 yrs I travelled free by bus in Zone 1/2 by showing the same paper ticket. Felt so good. Sorry TfL."
"If you ask me my favourite child, I can answer in an instant. But I genuinely can't even contemplate which of the three dogs I have had is my favourite as I am overcome with guilt for even considering such a thing."
After a minor verbal altercation in a queue at the airport an old man pushed me to the ground in a rage. I was fine but feigned a serious injury and insisted the police be called. Police came and spoke to him and he ended up missing his flight. I'm 6'4 19st
I 'switched teams' in my 40s and started dating women. I told my Daily Mail reading parents and their reaction was 'meh'. Turns out it didn't even make onto there Top Ten list of 'weird' things I'd done.
"Have never felt the class divide between my husband and I as strongly as the other day, when my posh MIL offered me coffee with a you'll be used to instant, won't you? Worse still, she apologised after. She's right. Real coffee gives me the shits."
"To our lovely neighbour who phoned the police on us for smoking weed in my garage. Yeah I was naughty but being an amputee it eleviates the pain, THE SAME WAY KEYING YOUR CAR UP DID"
"I'm a 6ft2in man in my 30s with a successful business career, wife and 2 children. I still sleep with my childhood teddy bear every single night. I even do a little voice for him and he interacts with family members. He's a bit of a prick"

"When I was a kid, I thought the Tory party was short for the Conservatory Party, and that they were just people who particularly liked conservatories. Which made sense because most of the members were quite old."
"I like sex, I like doggy-style but, if my husband sticks his thumb up my arse one more time I'm going to shit all over him, literally, and figuratively when it comes to the divorce."
"I have a job that requires working in complex spreadsheets. I went for an eye test and was prescribed glasses, almost immediately my company profits went up by at least 20%."
I tell people I knew my wife was 'the one' on our first date but really it was when my best friend asked if she swallowed and I realised I liked her too much to tell him.
"As an 80s student I had a job as stage crew for a lot of old Wembley Stadium shows. Once I discovered that it was unlocked, a regular post lunch treat was a big poo in the private toilet in the Royal Box as I skinned up a fattie, which I made a point of lighting as I left. #old"
When a delivery driver delivers loads of parcels at the same time I always make a sarcastic comment like 'Christ! What has she bought this time?!' or 'I'll cut up her bloody credit card if she carries on like this!'. 
I'm a single man and I live alone. I just like buying stuff
"After settling in to lockdown and managing to exhaust all the porn I could handle, I have gotten into a hobby which is slowly but surely ruining my life. I've been betting half my salary on Ukrainian table tennis, its just extremely moreish."
I'm in my late 20s. People keep asking my how I lost so much weight. I say exercise and diet. Really I just stopped binge drinking in my room alone every night.
I have never washed my swimming trunks. Ever. Chlorine does that right?
When I sow seeds and have to thin them out once they've all started to grow I chop the strong healthy ones down and let the small struggling ones live.
"Aged 14, attending a wet carnival day, me and some mates snuck into a derelict house in town. Played spin the bottle and put our fags out on the old 70s sofa. It smouldered, we thought the rain would put it out and left, but the next day learnt the house had burnt down."
"Until my late 20s, I thought those little sockets you see in hotel bathrooms that say Shavers only were kind of discriminatory, as in why is it only people who are old enough to shave allowed to use them?"
I got fed up of being the only male living in a house full of females.I fitted a secret piss-pipe next to the washing machine. Everything was going well until I opened the machine one day to the smell of urine.Turns out I'm not the best plumber as my micturition was flowing back.
"When I go out for a run, I always take note of any unusual sights or people that I see, so that if I return home and find my wife murdered, I have a watertight alibi."
"It's my old Uni housemate's wedding next month to her boyfriend that she's been with since school. All through Uni me and her regularly banged after nights out and when nobody else was in. He doesn't know and I feel so guilty now. I never did at the time, but now I'm ashamed"
"The only good thing about Microsoft Teams is as a vehicle to fake my own disappearance. In the unlikely event I ever go through with it, during a meeting I'll pay out work actors to kick my door in and stage a kidnapping. Fuck getting in a canoe."

"I was leaving work one day back in 2003 and was met at the door by a chap who said he was there to fix a computer. I let him in. The next day to my horror I realised that he'd nicked several laptops, the company credit card and spent 1000's. I never told anyone I had let him in."
I heard Push It by Salt-n-Pepa on the radio today and it occurred to me for the very first time that the song has sexual connotations. I am 46.
"Years ago, my very racist neighbor verbally abused my mother and told her speak ENGLISH!!! as I was bidding my mum goodbye after a long visit. A day later, I nicked my neighbor's mail, opened one that looked important, saw it was a big cheque and tore it up into tiny confetti"
Had a mate in school who had 26 warts on his hands. I told him one day that he should be careful when having a wank. He told me years later that he wore marigolds for about a year after that while pulling the stomach off himself.
Aged 8 my bedroom was next to the stockroom for the Easter Eggs. The Freddo Eggs were the easiest to open and reclose undetected. The Tuesday after Easter there was a queue of angry parents at my parents' shop. I received a sound thrashing and haven't eaten a Freddo since.
"Im a Dr and met an attractive woman at a friends birthday party. Over the course of the eve she kept saying she should place me. Eventually, I had to lean in and whisper to her that I treated her genital warts. Horrified doesn't really express her face."
"Each time I return home safely after a long drive with my family in the car, I always take a few minutes on my own with the car to say thank you for keeping us safe and getting us home."
Left my former employer under acrimonious circumstances 2 months ago and they still haven't removed my access to Google Drive. Every time I want to import slides for my current freelance project I can see all the decks my ex-boss is working on.
"I can't wait to get back to the office so I can wear a headset again and pretend to be in back to back meetings, thus avoiding any colleague interaction."
"I'm completely hopeless at almost every job I do, but I keep moving up the career ladder because I really enjoy the interview process. I like to pretend I'm on Graham Norton."
"One time, when I was a teenager and the house was empty, I had a wank and came into a plant pot. For a few weeks afterwards I was terrified that a human / rubber plant hybrid would emerge from the soil and point accusingly at me. Biology was not a strong subject."
Everyone in my class agreed to pay me a quid if I shouted out CHICKEN BOLLOCKS at the top of my voice during assembly. I did & got £28. A lot for a 9yo. I was also sent to see a shrink for suspected Tourettes. I was diagnosed which meant I could swear whenever I liked.
"I'm a project manager at work. More than once I've seen projects from start to finish without having a clue what's going on, just watching other people do their jobs competently. Thank you colleagues."
"As a paperboy years ago, found £20 note on the floor; looked around to see if anyone dropped it. No-one there. Felt guilty I might be depriving a little old lady of money for food, so I gave £5 to a local church, spent the rest on porno mags."
"My Network Railcard expired last April. Since COVID hit I haven't had my train tickets checked once, so I still buy discounted tickets on the machines without having renewed it."
"Went on a ghost tour to an asylum. It was clearly bollocks so when we got to the lobotomy room, I started subtly kicking the radiator behind me. Most of the guests shit themselves, the tour guide turned white, & insisted we move on to the next room as we'd upset the spirits."

I had to make redundancies from my company due to COVID and one person lost their job purely because they insisted on using the Comic Sans MS font despite being told otherwise for many years. They'll never know.
"Ever since I found out house spiders die outside, I've only been pretending to my wife that I'm putting them out the window. We've got fucking hundreds of them now."
My brother is quite high profile in the football world. He makes a fortune but doesn't help the family at all despite being worth a few million. I fantasize about selling stories of his affairs to the press
"I don't enjoy being a dad or a husband. I crave being alone more than anything but have two kids under three now and I feel like my authentic life is over. Every day, I'm counting the hours. I feel guilty about this all the time"
"When I get an instruction from the sat nav, I reply roger that as if it's a order I'm receiving for my important mission. I deliver photocopiers."
"When I was in my mid-teens, I was masturbating to a picture of two women in their underwear, sat in front of the computer screen at home. My mum walked in and in a panic, told her I was checking for cancer"
"I came back from a night out and really needed a wee but didn't want to wake up my housemates. I pissed in a Lucozade bottle I had in my room, woke up the next morning thirsty as hell and boom, I had a huge mouthful of my own piss. Never drank Lucozade since."
For years I thought the football song Three Lions was called Three Lines. I don't follow football and just presumed England were sponsored by Adidas.
"I've just started a new job as a mortgage advisor, apart from passing the exams I have no idea what I'm doing, no training of note and get most of my info from google or watching YouTube videos. Crazy when you think about it. I could go to prison if get this shit wrong!"
A bird shit has just landed in my brother's pint and he hasn't noticed. I'm letting him drink it.
I really don't believe that my 2 Golden Retrievers are clever enough to send me a Father's Day card or buy me beer & chocolate.
I reckon another dog does it for them.
I've owned and lived in my house for twenty years. I've never once been in the loft. The thought of entering a room head first gives me the willies. I'm convinced I'll be immediately decapitated.
23 year old brother has been dossing about at my mum's since the pandemic so I swiped his railcard. He's not using it and nobody can identify the differences now you have to wear a mask on public transport
"I had a normal upbringing, but when I was 5, I called 999 and said my parents were beating me. A few police cars and about 5 officers came to the house. Took my parents aside separately, and the police searched me for bruises. I still feel awful because my parents are lovely."
"In a rage, I smashed my boss's scanner - in the days when they were expensive and rare. I covered my crime by putting his heavy law books on top of it. He assumed he'd put the books there & broken it himself."
"I'm a 51 year old ex pastry chef and I am still petrified that every time I crack an egg, a zombiefied chicken faetus will fall out and attack me."

In my teens my parents had sky TV installed with the feed piped to all tvs In the house. I would leave uk living on then go to bed just before 12. As the adult channel 10 min freeview came on it was a race against time to finish my wank before my mum changed the channel.
"I just spent my Saturday evening making a parody Twitter account for a new UK government agency and it was, honest to God, the most fun I've had in months. Sure those accounts are annoying, but the rush of anonymity + satire + immediate reactions from people is addictive."
"At 18, I once spilt a can of beer and the family pet dog drank it all. He was worse for weather the following day and my parents took him to the vets who couldn't work out what was wrong."
Needless to say he made a miracle recovery one the hangover wore off
"When I lived with my parents, I used to go to the loft to wank, I could pull the ladder up behind me and lock it in position - no disturbances! Extra bonus, the loft was only half boarded, so I used to spaff off into the loft insulation instead of worry about spunk disposal."
As a young man I was persuaded to act in a stag film. It's just turned up in the vintage section of a porn site. My excitement is tempered by the fact the woman with me died last year from covid.
"I once catfished an acquaintance who was badmouthing me, he then took a bus from Wales to Cornwall to meet this girl after she arranged he would stay with her, as he hit Newquay I deleted this fake profile and he slept In a public toilet for the night."
"Once, after a swimming lesson in Primary school, I couldn't find my pants when getting dressed. In a complete panic, I grabbed the first pair I seen. Then watched as the owner of said pants frantically searched for hers. I still feel horrible to this day"
"I joined the school choir because of a girl I liked, the choirmaster stopped us and said someone was off key. I mimed when we started again and he said that's better, so for about a year I went to practice and never sang a note."
My partner refers to two halves of a sandwich as two sandwiches. This has led to several disappointing lunches when I've asked for one sandwich and only received half. I now buy rolls to avoid this.
"Jerry Springer the Opera stopped me being an insufferable atheist- for some morning mass, for others hairy ass taught me that we're all just desperately seeking whatever gets us through. Hard to admit that a song called 'I Just Wanna Shit My Pants' made me a better person"
Think I have a type of sex tourettes. When I'm cumming I shout 'That's the ticket' in a gruff northern accent. Try really hard not to do it but just can't stop. Needless to say I'm not a relationship.
"When my kids were younger, I'd often sneak a few sweets into various pockets of their coats so they'd have a nice surprise. I've never told them I did this."
I once broke up with a girl on account of her sideburns. All my mates were calling her Noddy Holder.
I put random friends who I'm no longer close with as my emergency contacts. Just like to imagine their bemusement if ever called upon
I have lots of elaborately faked social media accounts that I run just so that I can send positive messages to friends or strangers who need an ego boost. It's amazing how much people love a you look fab! tweet from a catwalk model.
"Every time I see someone has replied with a poem/rhyme to a Fesshole tweet, I immediately block them."

"At my weekly men's fitness class, my heart always sinks when the coach says right lads, pair up as it reminds me of school all over again where I was always last to get picked for any sports teams….I left school 40 years ago"
"If someone does not put the Next Customer Please Bar out for me I chuck a pack of batteries accidentally onto their shopping, they never notice 9 times out of 10"
I keep a viagra tablet in my wallet because I may be old but I am an optimist
To entertain myself on long motorway journeys I practice changing lanes without hitting the cats eyes. It's surprisingly satisfying to achieve a smooth lane change without the annoying thud.
"I miss going to functions with a 80s/90s buffet. Sometimes I put triangle sandwich's, pork pies etc on the table, go to the pub until it's slightly stale the return home and enjoy! I live on my own"
I have just one very long and very thick white hair in my nose I have to pluck out 2 times a year when it tries to grow past my nasal opening. I call it Boris.
Fixing my uncle's PC. He'd left loads of web browser tabs open – porn obviously – not so obviously - only pictures of guys loving farm animals.Knowing he was brought up on a farm and was undoubtedly re-living past glories made it a thousand times worse
"At the time I was very supportive and told everyone that I thought it was a lovely tribute, but the poem my cousin wrote for our Nan's funeral was absolutely pathetic."
"I used to DJ at a student pub. If I ever played the full version of Blue Monday by New Order during one of my sets, it was because I needed a shit and I knew could get to the toilet, do my business and get back again before the track finished."
I am the chair of my village parish council. We have one street that causes all our problems. I dream of bombing that one road and all the houses in it. Would raise the village IQ.
"Our sex life has dried up, so last night I had a secret wank under the covers next to my husband. It was great but in the middle of my orgasm he asked me about getting the appointment to get the dog's testicle stitches out."
"In my 20s I dumped the best gf I've ever had because my sister & Mum privately mocked her big nose. Not a month goes by that I don't miss her. Best sex, gorgeous eyes, lovely personality. I'm an idiot for ever caring what anyone else thinks. Now I'm trapped in a sexless marriage."
"When I am in the shower, my girlfriend occasionally slips her hand through the shower curtain and wanks me off to completion. Thing is, we never discuss it. It's just something that happens. At least, I think it's her. Or someone wearing her nail varnish."
My husband takes a supplement every day for his joints. What he does not realise is that it's actually for old dogs. I refill the original bottle bought from the chemist. Saves a fortune and am sure his hair is more glossy.
"At work I'm known as the go-to person for IT help. A trick I use with frozen computers is to hold in the power button for five seconds. This cuts the power so you can reboot. I learnt this trick many years ago, from a child."
"When I was a teenager I use to get super depressed and my thing was buying a pack of fish fingers, letting them defrost and eating them raw. I tried it again the other day and though to myself who hurt that poor boy"

"When me and a few mates lived in a squat in the 1980s, we used to go out at night and leave notes for the milkman, ordering extra items, in other people's empties, then go and collect the stuff before most people were even out of bed. Free stuff always tastes better."
"I sometimes call my cat Bagpipes as a nickname. My family think I'm just calling him a silly made up name. However, I once accidentally stood on him while he was miaowing and he made a loud sound just like Bagpipes."
Lockdown has been made easier by watching birds in the garden whilst I work from home. I've encouraged more in by sneaking out to sabotage my neighbour's feeders late at night. He now has a vendetta against the local squirrels he thinks are stealing the food.
"Without reason or warning my sister decided to cut me out of her life 18 months ago and I'm beyond happy. I found out by accident and it saved me having to pretend I wanted to do family anymore, it's brilliant."
"My cats brought in a magpie. Chased it round my bedroom - blood everywhere. I managed to free it but it turned up dead on my neighbour's doorstep. Now she's convinced she's cursed and there's a lone magpie that cries in my garden, clearly bereaved. I feel so guilty."
"HMV would always swap CDs if they looked new enough so I bought CDs that were cheaper in other shops, take them to HMV and swap them for the CDs I wanted. Best find was a Paul McCartney album that was £16 in HMV but only £3 in Boots. Bought that thing many times."
My vibrator has a setting that sounds like it's playing Smoke On The Water.
It wasn't until I moved to Bournemouth for University that I fully appreciated that it wasn't the bombing of Poole Harbour that brought the Americans into WW2.
"When I was a teenager I decided to copy my elders and use terms of endearment like darling, sweetheart, honey. First tried it on a checkout woman old enough to be my mum. Got nervous and it came out loudly as Thank you lover. The whole shop seemed to stop and stare. I ran off."
"I'm a premature ejaculator approaching 40. Only way I sustain more than a few minutes is by visualising myself as Nelson Mandela going about stately duties, collecting the noble piece prize etc. It helps still further if I subconsciously chant 'free Nelson Mandela'."
During a day in the countryside my wife asked if the brown cows were where they got chocolate milk from. She was serious and a bit of me died that day for being with someone so stupid.
Since wearing shorts for the past couple of weeks I'm surprised how much piss splashes up your legs when you pee. My trousers must stink.
"When I was younger, I found and stole two dirty video tapes from my grandad's dresser. I always wondered if he suspected I took them, or if he just thought he lost them. Anyway, thanks for the good times grandad."
When my dad passed away I changed a lot of things in my life. He wanted me to be happy in my work. I now work freelance in VFX for film and TV. A few times now I've secretly placed a B&W photo of him from the 60s into productions when I've had the creative freedom to do so.

Every Monday morning my team has a meeting where our boss talks about herself for half an hour because she thinks she's so important. Since working from home I've taken to having my morning shit during the meeting. It's quite satisfying.
"A neighbour hates people parking outside her house in her parking space. I deliberately park there and leave the car for weeks at a time. Sometimes, I turn it around so that she thinks she's missed a chance to reclaim her spec. I can see her peering out of her window, fuming."
"Peaked at life today. Making my kids sandwiches, I got enough butter on the knife to spread over all 4 slices of bread perfectly in one go"
I bought a long tshirt once in error online. Now I wear it as a pretend dress while working from home on my own. The videocallers have no idea. I quite like it. I'm 36 and think I probably shouldn't tell my wife.
"I've worked 16 years as a travelling salesman. For every single trip I've ever done, I've claimed one mile more more in expenses mileage than I drove. It's the small victories that keep you winning."
I once had a dream that I had wild kinky sex with Greg Wallace and now I can't watch MasterChef .
"My toddler woke me up one night needing comforted. I was so exhausted, I lay down on the floor next to his bed and help his hand. I needed a piss but couldn't face getting up again so put my nob in a bag of nappies and just went for it"
"Coming home pissed one bin collection night, myself and a group of mates moved an entire street's bins to a neighbouring street."
"When I was 12, we had a Siamese cat my mum spent a fortune trying to breed with stud cats for pedigree kittens. Alone one day, I let the local tom cat in to see what would happen it resulted in 4 not very Siamese kittens."
I send contributions into @SwearClock when I am sat on the toilet. When I see them posted on the account I am always shocked at how vile my imagination can be. My wife would be disgusted.
Me and an old girlfriend used to have sex to decidedly unsexy songs for a laugh. Laugh's now on me as I get a lob-on every time I hear 'I've got a brand new Combine Harvester
"My wife has commented how much softer my hands are since I've been working from home.. what she doesn't mention is how her moisturisers don't seem to last as long as they use to, nor how smooth my cock is"
"There's a very well known comedian who officially isn't on this platform, but actually is. He and I go back 30 years. I wish he would put his name to his anonymous account because his twitter game is far better and funnier than most celeb blueticks."
"I cleared out all my CDs when I moved house a couple of years ago. Who needs them when you got Spotify? Only now I can't remember what the fuck I used to listen to, and endlessly play the same few albums like it's Desert Island Fucking Discs"

I found what I thought was a small flake of dead skin in my belly button. Had to get tweezers to pull it out and had to pull really hard. When it finally gave way a thick rope of dead skin almost 2cm long came out. I found the experience deeply moving and long to do it again.
"Years ago, I lived next door to the neighbour from hell. Long after we had moved away, I sent a load of plumbers, gas engineers etc to his house during the night. He thought it was his current neighbour, and he punched him in the face. He got done for assault. I have no regrets."
Recently realised I need to slow down and start chewing my food properly. I pooped out an unblemished slice of mushroom.
"Whenever I use my authenticator app, I like to pretend they're nuclear launch codes and that I've just had a big argument with Denzil Washington about nuking Russia."
I poured hand gel in my ears to see what would happen. I am a 42 year old man with kids. Nothing good. Imagine if your ears had been eating chillies. I've done it so you don't have to.
"I don't know how I'm going to go back to pub measures when hospitality fully reopens. At the start of lockdown I could get about 14 glasses out of a bottle of whisky. By Christmas it was only 10; now it's 6, maybe 7."
"I have schizophrenia. It's well managed with medication but when it gets particularly bad I tell the voice to I'm gonna fuck you up/fuck off loudly as a coping mechanism, often without thinking. This has lead to three fights. Think it's time for a new method."
"There's an old guy in Florida with the same name as me who keeps entering my Gmail address when he shops online. Today he has booked tickets for Donald Trump & Bill O'Reilly Live in Orlando in December, so I have changed the name on his account to Trump Isacunt."
When we were potty training our son he refused to sit down to wee because I wee standing up. This caused alot of mess.So we agreed I would wee sitting down so he would too. He's 17 now and I still wee sitting down. Absolute game changer. The ladies have it right.
"When I was on holiday in Spain aged about 12 I took a poo in the hotel lobby toilet and I wouldn't flush. The cleaner was there, so I called them into the cubicle to see at the problem. I pointed at my stool, they looked, I hit the flush, and it went down first time."
"The index finger on my left hand has a very long nail. I'm sure most people including some family members think it's narcotics related. But the reality is, I use it to pick my nose more thoroughly. #includingsomefamilymembers"
"As I get older I find myself enjoying the music of Celine Dion, Simply Red & Phil Collins a lot more than I feel I should. I'm 42 and still love lots of new music but I find stuff like Collins is a comfort blanket of sorts."
"First day at new job I hid myself in the toilet to check out the massive blister that had appeared on my foot. Took off my boot and said out loud, cor that's going to be a whopper! Not realising there was a queue outside the cubicle."
I live in the penthouse of a smart London block with expansive balconies. My absolute pleasure is watching my neighbours below eat outside as I pick off tiny slivers of my athlete's foot and let them float down on to their table.

I have a fear of spiders living in my toaster. I let my toaster toast nothing for a minute before I put my bread in. I do this so it'll kill any spiders that may be living in there.
"I had a job sub-editing TV listings in the 90s. I used to swap the videoplus codes for VCRs around to make the text fit - the more inappropriate, the better, e.g. Antiques Roadshow for Channel 5 smut."
"Since I finished university with a 2:2, I've told everyone that has ever asked that I got a 2:1, including employers, my partner and my parents. Nobody has ever found out otherwise."
People keep complimenting me on my aftershave and I tell them it's Sauvage. Truth is I recently bought some emergency Lynx Africa on a hot day for the first time since I was 15 and due to positive feedback I've not looked back.
I have fake smoke breaks just to get out the office regularly. Often my boss comes with me and I have to ask him can I nick one just to sustain the charade. The baccy buzz is horrendous and has me lying down on the floor in the bogs for a good 10 mins after every one. Worth it.
"Once a week I put £5 in an envelope and give it anonymously to a local good egg. Last week it was a young neighbour who did shopping for the elderly man next door. It's not even altruism on my part, I just like the excitement of doing it undetected."
"I haven't had a toothbrush for years. I just use one of the kids' or the wife's, whichever one takes my fancy."
"Making a cup of tea for my dad, he caught me putting the milk in first, and gave me a spiel about how the boiling water stews the milk, so I made it different, but since then I've made it milk first, and the old bastard has not complained once."
"When filling in boring forms I always give myself the most glamourous title available from their scroll down options. If they have 'other', I always put 'Wizard'. It livens up conversations with utility companies when they have to address me as Viscountess, or Bishop."
After sex I always sing I'm so jizzy to myself to the tune of Dizzy by the Wonder Stuff.
"When I clean the cat litter, I like to imagine that I am an archaeologist unearthing ancient treasure rather than cat turds"
"Whilst working for a retailer I was moved to the tills, I found a way to do fake refunds, pocketing the resulting funds in cash or gift cards. I used to feel like Pablo Escobar. The security was poor and we knew the camera's weren't working. They've gone bankrupt now."
I was almost fifty years old when I realised that the honeycomb in a Crunchie isn't the same as the honeycomb in a bee hive.
I used my Spanish g/f to find decent assignments from Spanish Unis that answered my assignments. Then used online translation into Greek and then English to avoid plagiarism software. 30 mins tweaking grammar and bingo. 1st class has degree
"I've always had one boob bigger than the other. I was curious what they looked like to other people, because I'd only seen them in the mirror, reversed. My parents' laptop had a webcam, so I took a topless, headless selfie. I forgot to delete it. That was an awkward conversation."
"Throughout my pregnancy, my husband hinted that he thought I'd cheated on him. Whenever he accused me, I strenuously denied it. Now our son is 5 and really looks like him, he's dropped it. But it's true, and it was with my husband's dad, so my son is in fact his half-brother."
"I've started a diary to document my everyday life & the news, in the hope that someone will find it years from now & enjoy reading about this last year from the point of view of an ordinary person living through Covid. I know no-one will probably read it, but you never know."

I'm bald with a great shaped head and can spot the first signs of balding a mile away. It gives me great pleasure when I know someone who's a cunt is going bald and will look shit. Not all baldies are created equal my friend
Earlier this year I found a large mole had suddenly appeared on my toddler's face. I convinced the Dr he needed an appointment - in the surgery car park in the sleet for Covid reasons. Inside 10 seconds the Dr had picked it off - a lump of chewed raisin. She was not impressed.
In 2006 I answered the telephone during my favourite tv show. This better be good... Doctor Who is on. It was my now dead grandma. Whenever I watch the show these days I long for her to ring me.

"At Hatfield College, Durham in early 90s I was invited to see the Master, who spoke to me about politics, hobbies and an 'interesting job' in govt with lots of travel. Didn't catch on and left, only to realise years later I'd rejected opportunity to be 007. It still fucks me off."
"In 1991, I was delivering newspapers early one Sunday, and attempted to jump a shared wall separating two gardens, I failed, clipped it and it collapsed in a pile of rubble. Sorry people at 28 South Park Terrace, it wasn't vandals, it was your local friendly paperboy."
"Sometimes when I'm buying my fiancée a valentines card, I buy two, one that says To my fiancee and another that says To my girlfriend just to see the look of disgust on the cashiers face"
"When I worked in Parliament, I took a leak one day but was distracted by the smells and loud straining noises coming from a toilet cubicle. The MP having a dump then emerged and whenever I see him on TV now I am haunted by that incident."
I run ultramarathons but when I visit the supermarket I always park as close to the front door as I can so I don't have to walk too far.
"I work in cyber-security. Many people who are openly fans of particular football teams have passwords/PINs related to their teams, and are so, so easily guessable. I've no sympathy for them when they get hacked, it's just I sadly inevitably have to help clean up their IT fallout."
"Whenever I get the chance at someone else's house I always snaffle their sandwhich meat. Doesn't matter who it is or how many times I've met them, your meat is my meat."
"My wife came home after staying 2 nights at her sister's house & she was massively impressed at how well I'd made the bed. Truth is, I got pissed & fell asleep on the sofa on both nights, so she's admiring her own work."
"Neighbours bought their kids a huge trampoline. It's right by my back door. All day, all night, squeak, shriek, squeak. I dream of taking the scissors to it in the dark."
"One think nobody tells you about getting old is how it changes your farts. As a young man my well-machined sphincter allowed me to pass gas in silence, blaming friend, foe and family pet alike. These days I sound like the brass section in a novelty West Country folk band."
"Before retiring last month I was a traffic warden for 12 years. Issued thousands of parking tickets. Every single one contained a deliberate error, meaning if they challenged it, nobody would have paid a penny. You're welcome."
Played a round of crazy golf with my 14 year old son recently. We got to the last few holes I realised he was a couple of shots ahead at which point I changed a couple of 3s to 4s. Just not ready for him to beat me at something yet. Def not ready to face my own mortality!
"On the way home from the pub, we sometimes needed to drunkenly pee. One time we peed on the local Tory MP's doorstep. It became a permanent ritual for us all; such a shame the pandemic put a stop to our pub and pee trips."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something illegal with a car key?
"Whilst I accept it is irrational, nonsensical and unpleasant, I have the urge to punch an Alpaca."
"I realised that when I see LMAO I pronounce it le miaow in my head, like a kind of sarcastic French cat. But I have never said it out loud because I've never really met anyone I would say that to. So it exists as a pronunciation only in my head, which is kind of weird."
"Every now and then when I'm masturbating, I get a feeling that all my dead relatives are watching me. It totally kills the moment."
"Despite asking nicely for ages, my neighbour will not stop playing shit music and cry singing almost every night till 2am. I have work at 5am and sick of it. I've now got HMRC onto him for all his cash in hand jobs. Not sorry one bit."
"I'm a white, chubby woman in her 30s with frizzy hair and a forgettable face. I use the fact I am so unremarkable to steal things from Sainsbury's. No-one gives me a second glance. I've lifted £1000s in clothes, books and makeup so far."
"During the first lockdown I asked my elderly neighbour if there was anything I could do for them, they asked me to get them the Daily Mail, I did everyday for 3 weeks, I told the lady at the newsagent it wasn't for me everytime. I don't talk to my neighbour anymore."
A friend and I created multiple fake accounts on a local town forum website and started some online arguments over nothing just for entertainment. Some poor academic grabbed the whole thing and used it as thesis material in his degree about technology changing country life.
"About 20 years ago I was showing my mum home movies of my children playing, when my arse suddenly appeared bouncing up and down on my girlfriend, it was only 33 seconds long - the home porn, not my performance - but she saw every second of it, I still can't look her in the face."
"Whenever I have to kill a wolf on Assassin's Creed, I pause first to check my dog isn't watching or listening, then proceed as long as he's not. Can't risk ruining the bond we have between us by him thinking I'm a dog mauler."
I never realised co-habiting would involve cleaning up so many pubes. Mainly in the bathroom but elsewhere too.
"Right. Let's see what were the best confessions from the public for May 2021. A bumper crop we think. Well done everyone, and please share this wide to encourage more people to follow @fesshole and keep confessing. https://t.co/trg5hmdmYI"
After a mate's wedding we got really pissed. The wife was up for bum games in our hotel room and all we had was a tube of Savlon antiseptic as lube. We've never spoken of this experience in over 20 years nor tried backdoorsies again. Or bought Savlon.
Me and my girlfriend play a game called Kindle or Hand where we poke each other and you have to guess whether it was a kindle or a hand. We sing a theme tune to the tune of Blankety Blank
I lied and told my local authority I'm doubly incontinent and go through lots of adult nappies just so they'd give me a bigger wheelie bin.
I'm a senior level designer at a triple A games company. All the levels I'm involved in have also been designed with the help of my children. They always get to pick somewhere to put something. Even just foliage
"I got the best parking spot at Tesco twice in a row, right by the trolleys and exit. Biggest buzz I've had in ages, felt like royalty all day."
My friend spent a stupid amount of money on a 4k TV. I have been telling him that I can't see a difference between 4k and normal TV ever since.I refuse to use the HD channels when he's around just to annoy him further.I can see the difference perfectly well.
"My dogs legs have gone. The last 10 years I've run with him on the field, with him sitting to give me a few seconds head start; he's destroyed me every time."
"I barely jog now, but let him feel he's still the man as he gets ahead of me, and he turns, wagging his tail in pride."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something charming with a dvd player?
I let the dog crap in the back garden and do a weekly poo hunt to pick them all up. I have a personal challenge to get as many dog turds as possible in a single handful. Crusty ones are easier to grip.
"If someone compliments my cooking I always say it's just a good recipe or seasoning. It isn't, I chuck half a teaspoon of MSG in everything and it makes everything taste amazing"
"Had to see the consultant today as he operated on my balls 2 months ago. The wife is away at the moment, and despite a rigorous regime of self-abuse, I came close to getting a lob on. He is male and in no way attractive. Pictured Dominic Cummings to avoid an embarrassing incident"
For the last 6 weeks I've been playing Harry Potter and Star Wars games on my phone. Today I realised that I might be a nerd.
I make sure I extensively scour the internet for any bit of comic book lore in relation to upcoming Marvel TV shows and films so can impress my son with my knowledge when we watch them together. I know I dont have many years left before I can no longer impress him with anything
"I'm sorry Alitalia, but yes, back in the 80s it was me who changed the letterpress type so your advert in The Informer read 'requiring shit workers' instead of shift workers."
"About 11 or 12 years old, I had just discovered internet porn. Mum found the search history on the family PC soon after. Assuming I was too young to have been the culprit, she held a full on interrogation with my dad and older brother. I sat in the corner and said nothing."
"I used to work at a Tesco petrol station on the tills. For light entertainment, a colleague and I used to pretend we didn't have any £5 notes left when giving change. At the end of the night we'd both count how many £5 notes each of us had saved before declaring the winner."
I have anxiety and find myself squeezing my penis through my joggers during Zoom calls as a sort of stress ball I suppose? Dreading going back to face to face meetings in case I take the habit with me.
"During a break in a seaside B&B with my gf, now wife, we woke up after a boozy night to find a huge sweetcorn encrusted turd in the bathroom sink. We still hold the other responsible for it over a decade later"
"Sometimes when walking the dog in the woods I secretly hope I find a dead body. Nothing untoward, just think I'd enjoy the excitement and attention of waiting for the police and being interviewed by local reporters."
"As a youth me and a mate went on a building site and rotated the house planning lines by quite a bit. To this day, one house is noticeably out of line with its neighbours."
"In the 90's, I worked in customer service for London's biggest mini cab firm. We'd bowl around town charging rides to celeb accounts & if they complained when the bill came in, I'd credit it. Free travel."
One rainy afternoon I amused myself by changing all the contacts in my phone to amusing nicknames that would flash up when the phone rang. Six months on I've forgotten the original names and I have no idea who it is when I get a call.
"Aged 14, a mate and I were in his parents greenhouse whilst there was a storm, him smoking, me flicking matches. Rain stopped so we left to go out. We returned & his Mum told us the greenhouse had been struck by lightning and burnt down. Every time there is a storm I feel guilty"
One December evening the local scouts were knocking on doors choir singing raising money for a local charity me & my mate got in front of them knocked on some doors sang a couple of lines & collected a load of money and spent it on booze from Threshers & got pissed
"I used to play a game on social media, I'd find ex colleagues, old school friends, etc and send them a message to say I used to have a crush on youI had a few awkward chats, a lot of no replies, and a few good nights in hotels."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something weird with a bits of sticky backed plastic?
"I'm a male cross-dresser. 90% of the guys I have slept with have been married. Of those, 90% only wanted to receive. I am certain straight people are a minority."
"If I'm carrying an empty cup to the kitchen, I pretend it's a helicopter flying low level, swooping through doorways, making turns and side-slipping, even flaring for landing as I set it down. I don't make the noises though."
I have a mad crush on Matt Hancock. I fantasise about him. I love the way he walks a bit like a 'proper lad' and how his suits always look slightly disheveled. Makes me think he's probably just been having a right good bonk and his suit got a bit crumpled in the process.
"Age 19 I was once propositioned a guy in a public toilet. I was tempted, but something seemed off about his demeanour, so I left. A few days later there was a story in the paper about arrests for 'gross indecency' in the same loo, seemingly brought about by undercover police."
"I once did a little piss into a Dyson Airblade at my local Pizza Express to see what would happen. Yeah, it was as Epic as you could imagine."
"I work for Tesco. When I finally got the news that my enemy had succumbed to his cancer, I put together a themed good riddance celebration playlist and had party in the shop. Customers singing along to Finally by CeCe Peniston had no clue what they were participating in."
My friends and I started a Where's Wally competition type Instagram page years ago based around taking sneaky pictures of my nemesis whenever we saw him in public. 4 years on and I can't seem to stop. He'a been coming into my work lately and I post CCTV photos of him now too.
"I shot a wedding for a couple at work. It's a stressful time, and in the midst of it, I missed the confetti shot by a few seconds. Fail."
"I bribed the brides 9 year old sister with an energy bar to lob confetti in the air, snapped that and photoshopped it on later. Win."
"I once suddenly shat myself on the way home from school. I carried on walking, the shit slid down my leg until I could shake it out of the bottom. Nobody witnessed this. My big lump of poo remained on the side of the pavement for a long time."
In supermarkets I think it's fun to hide the nasty stack of Daily Mail/Sun papers under animal bedding or dog food to save people from their worst selves
"I've worked out that if 5 people in my near family die in the right order, I will become a millionaire from the inheritance, if they die in the wrong order I will not get a penny. It's a bit like a morbid lottery."
Every now and then I'll do a phantom poo when there is nothing in the toilet and the paper is clean after a wipe. They really make me question my sanity.
"Next time you go for a break to a seaside resort and decide to entertain yourself by shrieking at the top of your lungs up and down the high street at 4am, remember us. We're the staff who serve you. We're watching. And we're going to spaff all over your pizza."
I split with my 2 year old's mum when he was 4 months old. Her family had a get together and I hung around for half an hour before getting on my way. He was so confused when we spent time in the same room. It broke my heart realising this was alien to him.
"I once turned up at a bar for a date and upon arrival discovered said date was so astonishingly ugly I found them difficult to look at. I immediately claimed I needed the loo & instead simply left by the back door, which was conveniently located next to the toilet."
"I am a 44 year old adult who has been on a train 100s of times, but still don't know which is the front or rear train. Half the time I end up going the wrong way."

I like to stand naked in front of a mirror and imagine an attractive woman making complimentary remarks about my cock & balls as if I was standing in a pod on Naked Attraction
"Lockdown started nearly 16 months ago, and I still haven't even used a quarter of the bog roll I bought at the time."
"To anyone who didn't get any, I sincerely apologise."
"For the past three years I've had free hot drinks from McDonald's. If I ordered a loyalty card drink at the drive thru, 9 times out of 10, they wouldn't take the loyalty card. This is coming to an end though as the loyalty card is going digital."
Since my ex-girlfriend moved out I've had to start buying Venus razors - Gillette may be the best a man can get but they're shit for shaving your ballsack.
"Back when PCs were becoming more affordable I would go into Dixons and delete command dot com. So when they rebooted, it would fail to load up and need a complete rebuild."
"To all the guys - and some women too tbf - who think they're being subtle. You aren't, I can totally see when you check out my tits."
"I'm shagging the fittest girl at work but can't tell anyone, because she's married to someone else at work. I'm so proud of it and annoyed I can't brag about it to anyone who knows her."
"I tried to seduce my teacher when I was 16, by hiding in his office with no clothes on. I imagined he'd open the doors overcome with lust & slide straight inside me. He actually told me to get dressed & left the room. I felt so humiliated but now am so glad he was a good one."
I was 13 yrs old when Michael Jackson released Bad in 1987. I discovered today that Liberian Girl is in fact about a girl from Liberia and that it's not in fact about a librarian.
Gave up drinking recently at 50. Feels like Ewan McGregor when he quits heroin in Trainspotting - constant erections. Thank God the wife welcomes it!
To the neighbour who has taken to smoking strong weed in his garage during the evening. I am not sorry in the slightest at grassing you up to the rozzers. It stinks out the entire street.
"When I was little, my sister and I found a box of funny toys under my parents bed. We were giggling at them when the babysitter came in and told us to stop it and come downstairs. When we showed them to mum, she said they were for massages. They were gone the next time we looked."
"A till at Tesco developed a glitch that let you scan some items without it billing you for them, and the staff just cleared the error message without checking. I stole £15 worth of stuff in two trips and got really annoyed the next day when someone else had the magic theft till."
"My prosthetic leg fell off whilst i was at a cashpoint once. Inconvenient for me, horrific for the woman standing behind me."
"Whenever I stay with family or at a friend's house and use their shower, I always go absolutely mental with the shower gel and other products. Very liberal squeezes. After all, I didn't buy it."
Every day on my drive to work I pass a sign that says No Road Studs but I have no idea what that means or if I'm supposed to do something different as a driver. Adverse Camber is similarly a mystery.
My wife nearly caught me viewing the Daily Mail website. She only saw me switch screens and look a little red-faced. Now she thinks I was looking at porn. I'm too much of a leftie to confess what I was really looking at.

"Someone I worked with was always off work with injuries from being thrown off her horse repeatedly and, when they demanded money for getting her flowers, I just stuck a couple of coppers in there, because her massive shit machine clearly didn't want her on it."
"From age 8 to 18 I had worms. They mysteriously disappeared when I moved away to university. In the couple years since then I've put on like 4 stone. God I miss you guys, please come back."
"I always act upset when my cat chooses to sit on my partner and not me but actually I prefer it, they look so cute and cozy, l also don't have to worry about the furry little asshole biting me if I offend her by moving slightly to get comfy"
I just fly sprayed a bee thinking it was a wasp and I've genuinely never felt so terrible.
Home late from the pub with some mates in the mid-90s and decided we'd make a load of prank phonecalls. Managed to get the Duchess of Roxburghe out of bed - her number was listed in the phonebook - & chatted random bollocks about her fridge with her for 15 minutes. Poor woman.
"At a Nottingham nightclub in the 90s there was plenty of drink stealing going on one night. So me and a mate drank our pints, filled the glasses with piss, put them on a table and watched as 2 blokes stole and drank them. Would do it again."
"I am borderline-incompetent at my job and there's always one person who can see through my BS and thus becomes my work enemy - the Frank Grimes to my Homer Simpson, if you will. But that person either eventually moves jobs or I do, and thus the cycle continues."
"I'm 6'6 tall, and always hide bemusement when I hear someone saying their height in quarter inches, such as I'm 5'4 and 1/4. Such a small thing to do, squeezing in that extra bit."
When we first met my wife jokingly asked if I was the evil twin. Considering she was dating my brother at the time I guess she got her answer.
New neighbours get a lot of parcels but are never in as they work full time. Recently been quite moany that I don't rush round to deliver them as if I'm a fucking postman. They're about to learn that the collection office is a 50 min round trip away and only open 8-3.
"In the late 80s on a shopping trip with my friend and his mum, I hit the print button on a Dixon's sales terminal when no one was looking. The assistant couldn't get it to stop and we had to endure it spewing reams of paper onto the floor for 5 minutes."
Received a signed copy of a book by my favourite author as a present from a friend - she chose well. Less impressive was that she said she had gone to great lengths to get it signed and dedicated to me.... The book was published posthumously.
"I've always been 100% faithful to my OH but he's also fucked at least 4 other women that I know of. Now we're past the 7-yr mark, I just want to cash in my '7-year Itch' pass, shag as many blokes as I can & see if he believes the same BS excuses that he expected me to."
The people I work with don't like me very much. I know this because I am in a group email they don't know I can see. Haven't done anything about it yet. I just save their emails about me in a folder on my desktop marked 'final day speech'
"My best suit which I always wore to new customers etc was always blue suit, white shirt and red tie. I looked smart as fuck but now I can wear them in case anyone thinks I'm one of those UK MAGA Trump wankers"
I am almost 26 years of age and cannot tie my shoes. I've tried over the years but just never managed it.
"Never mind the 'olympic logo' on BBC London News, 'Goatse' also inspired the name of BT Openreach. Not that I fucking told them. I work in PR, our company did the rebranding. Not sorry at all, but still childishly amused."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something laughable with a scratching post?
"I work for Wetherspoons, whenever I put sauce in a wrap or panini I always write the word cunt without fail."
"The happiest I ever feel about anything is when the click of my car's indicator synchronises perfectly with the music I'm listening to at the time. Feels better than sex, including the sex that made my two babies"
"When I go for a wee I put bog roll flat in the water first pretending it's a battle ship, my piss is a space laser and I try to sink it. The greater the number of ply the harder you have to pee to complete the challenge."
"I hated my husband wearing sandals, so started painting his toenails. I claimed it was to test the colour and see how long it lasts before I use it on my own fingers."
I work in HR. I have a terrible fear that I pull a Priti Patel-style smirky/smug face when I am supposed to be showing compassion/concern. I try and look appropriately sad but I wonder whether I in fact look like a total sociopath.
A year or so before my Nana died she visited and I jokingly asked her if she wanted to take off her wig as I took her coat. Turns out it was a wig and she was really self-conscious about it. Sorry Nana x
"I work in IT & work from home. Everyone says I am really good at my job but in fact I Google most shit & on the ones I can't be arsed with, I remote reboot their PC's. Now my boss wants me to train people as I am so good at the job Fuck!"
"To any dealers out there, ditch the Electric Scooters; they are a dead giveaway. My mate's a copper in a Northern town that is infamous for it's drugs, and he says the first thing his colleagues look out for, when chasing Dealers, is an electric scooter. Get a bike instead"
I was bunking from school & saw a teacher. I claimed I was nearly mugged in a nearby park on the way in so ran home. It spiralled as my Mum called the police & I had to give a fake report. There were announcements in school & police presence in the park afterwards.
"My manager returned from an external meeting with an extra laptop charger they picked up by accident. I got asked to find out who it belonged to and send it back to the company. But I couldn't be bothered, never did and hid it in a store cupboard. 3 years later it's still there."
When I was 18 I set myself a challenge of sleeping with girls all with a name from the 'Mambo No 5' song. I'm embarrassed to say I've only managed one of said names.
"I was a teenage boy in the 80s without a TV in my room, my parents would go to bed around 11pm and I would stay downstairs to watch TV and have a wank. The problem with this was, on a Thursday, I would be pleasuring myself to Prisoner Cell Block H."
"I knew where my parents hid our Christmas presents. I got up to Carnival Night Zone on Sonic 3 with a save so on Christmas morning could jump straight in. I did a decent job of pretending, sorry. Ditto Sonic and Knuckles on my birthday just after which I got a head start on too."
As a teenager I paused the video on the scene with a topless woman and then tried to lick her nipples. Got quite the static shock and never tried that again.
"Hungover, I reached into some clean washing to get out a face mask when going to the shops. Got there and found I'd picked up some if my wife's knickers. Improvised and used them anyway."
"For some unfathomable reason, I've always been terrified by the thought of looking inside the toilet cistern."
"As kids my brother was a saver and I was a spender. Worked out fine for me, as what I spent on ice creams was mostly robbed from his piggy bank."

It was only when we did a project on it in secondary school that I realised euthanasia wasn't a country
"I got chatting to a woman on a hook-up site and we arranged to meet for sex. We went for a drink first and really got on, but she looked exactly like Peter Kay. I didn't want to hurt her feelings by backing out, so I went through with it. It was the hardest thing I ever done."
I got signed off with stress when red dead redemption 2 came out. I played it for three weeks solid on full sick pay.
"Blowing out candles on my 55th birthday, I wished that an elderly relative would die as I knew I was in line for a few quid, 2 weeks later they dropped dead. As a result I am now retired but racked with guilt"
I had a Saturday job at Argos when I was 18. Many products were in plain brown cardboard boxes. I used to swap the stickers on purpose so that customers would get a nice surprise when they got home. Or not.
"I have a personal phone and a work phone. Sometimes, when I want to get out of doing something I will ring my work phone and pretend there is an emergency. I last pulled this trick to get away from my father-in-law's 80th birthday party, which clashed with an England match."
"I steal at least one item every time I use a self-checkout. I tell myself it's a rebellion against capitalist companies replacing people with machines, but really I just like free stuff."
"Alone in bed I grabbed the wife's moisturiser for a wank. Soon after I noticed my right palm was dark brown and a quick inspection established that my cock was too. Tinted moisturiser, apparently. My mahogany cock was acceptable but my hand remained a totem of shame."
As a teen I accidentally walked in unnoticed on my dad going down on my mom..the worst part was we ate dinner at that table a couple hours later
"For the longest time, I thought The Wombles were declaring that they were from Wimbledon, and that they were common."
"Daughters essay about 'Family' got a see me from her tutor due to her 'a' looking like a 'c'.My cunt has very long hcir, My uncle loves my cunt, & my cunt loves my uncle and My cunt ccn speck French & Spcnish. Had me in stitches."
I used to deliver a well-known comedian's grumble mag on my paper round as a youth. Once a month me & the lads would gather in the woods near his house & thumb through it before slipping it back in his Telegraph & delivering. It often had the odd fizzy pop and crisp stain on it
"Me and my best friend, Ant, set up a 'penny for the guy' outside our local shop. We mad a little sign that said the money was going to the Live Aid. It didn't and we spent all the money on sweets. Ant passed away 2 years ago so I hope he was forgiven."
I have the runs and I can't stop singing 'woah bad belly' to the tune of Black Betty by Ram Jam
My best friend asked me to break up with his girlfriend which I reluctantly did for him. What he doesn't know is that we then arranged to meet up several times for wild sex
"I once crashed my car into a stationary minibus because the theme from Friends came on the radio and I did the handclaps, simultaneously losing control of the wheel. Told insurance I had to swerve for a cat."
"I once had sex with 3 different women in the same day without washing my bits in-between any of them, none of them knew about the others, at the time I thought I was a hero, 20 years later, I now just feel shame for how I treated them"

"As a teenage boy in the 90s, I was only caught wanking once by my parents. It was to the Spice Girls 'Say You'll Be There' music video. It still brings out a double cringe 25 years later."
I used to lock a work toilet cubical from the outside with a screwdriver keychain so I could have my own private toilet unused by the absolute animals I worked with. It was 2 months before anyone questioned by that one was always engaged.
"Worked at a 5star hotel in Dublin for 2 years. Served many VIPs and celebs. Bruce Springsteen was the best of the lot - funny, charming and tipped me €50 when I brought him his meal. The only turd was Van Morrison."
"During this locked-down year I moved to a city known for partying, and I think my friends think I'm having a mid-life crisis. Truth is, I am, but it's the kind of crisis that just involves me looking out of the window at young people having fun while I ponder how lonely I am."
"I've never been very good at describing to barbers what I actually want, so my haircuts are kind of different every time. It's quite exciting in a way: what style will I get this time? who will I be? Like a boring episode of Quantum Leap."
As a manager I hide in the toilets during the workers' breaktimes to listen to them slag off the managers. I'm not doing too bad but they fucking hate Derek.
"I tell everyone the first single I ever bought was Bowie - Absolute Beginners. It wasn't, it was Star Trekkin' by The Firm."
"I am an early thirties single female. If I want uncomplicated and novel sex, I book myself into a very nice London hotel for a weekend and sit reading at the bar. And wait."
"Back when I was at college in Italy, I got bored whilst writing and essay, so halfway through I started writing down the lyrics of a popular hip hop song at the time instead. Got top marks. I want to publicly thank @frankiehinrgmc"
"I concocted a magic potion from special ingredients that I found in the bathroom and got my little brother to drink it. Rather than gifting him the super powers that I'd promised, it put him in hospital. An admission from me would've helped my mum & doctors but I kept quiet. Soz"
"One of the nicer aspects of adulthood is being able to buy what you want from the giftshop when you go to places. Every few years I have a clear out and wonder why I bought that soft toy in the shape of a beaver, then I realise it's because I can"
"In my teens, I was learning to play the cornet. For 2 years I was in a junior colliery brass band. I was so afraid of playing a wrong note, that I mimed. I never once played a note. Nobody said anything."
"My dad is getting on a bit, so for birthdays and Christmas I buy him stuff I want or I can resell easily knowing when he passes I'm getting it back. It will ease the grief when I'm occupied setting up the eBay store."
"When I was a teenager I had a wart on my hand. For three years I couldn't get rid of it, and then almost overnight, without me noticing, it disappeared. 30 years later I still touch my hand where it used to be. I miss that wart and regret not having the chance to say goodbye."
In 1998-ish I designed some external landscaping in front of a cinema & swimming pool. I was having trouble drawing some sexy curves for a path until I l looked at an issue of a lads' mag.
There's now a footpath in the north-west of England based on Kelly Brook's hips.
My wife hates The Beatles. We just had an argument and she stormed off to bed. I've just spent an hour watching Beatles videos using her YouTube account. That'll fuck her algorithm up. Happy suggested Beatles videos for a while.
My Mum has spent 4 years painstakingly knitting a jumper for her grandson and I don't have the heart to tell her he's allergic to wool so will never wear it.

"Checking my mother wasn't home, I shut my door, put on my noise cancelling headphones, closed my eyes and began to masturbate. When I opened my eyes- my mother had left me some tissues without me hearing. Thanks, Sony."
"My wife believed, into adulthood, that sectarian violence meant attacking only the over 60's. She couldn't understand why Northern Irish people had such a problem with pensioners."
Well this reached the BBC!

Grew a beard for the first time during lockdown. Both wife and I were surprised how much it suits me and even if I say so myself I'm definitely better looking with it. Wife is delighted. I'm secretly gutted I didn't grow one earlier in case I might have done better than her.
An ex-girlfriend of mine turned to me halfway through watching Batman Begins to ask if it was a true story. She was in her twenties at the time.
"Until roughly one hour ago, I thought the children's drama about a High School was called Grey and Jill. I'm 39."
"I'm in my thirties with a good house, life, dog and mrs but by god some days I'd love to do the old big disappear abroad if only to see the media coverage of others looking for me"
"I recently started a nudes account on twitter, and it's been great! The positive attention has put a little spring in my step, plus it's motivation to tidy my bedroom."
"Sometimes if I'm the only one up doing some work in the evening, I order a secret Deliveroo. I request a call on arrival and operate in stealth to meet the gentleman motorcyclist in the road. Makes me feel like a fat James Bond."
"I haven't washed my feet in more than 20 years. I've always just assumed that standing in soapy shower water every morning somehow sort of does the job for me. It does, doesn't it?"
"I sometimes give my penis a wash in the toilets at the office on the off chance that someone might give me a blow job. I work in an office. On my own. Nobody ever visits, but it's just in case."
The dog points her back end at me so I can scratch the base of her tail and then twists round so I can also scratch under her chin at the same time. Every time she does this I ask her if she wants a spit roast.
I had a dream that John Bishop crashed his car while drunk. It was on the verge of catching fire but the door was smashed in so I rescued him by dragging him free & all he said was we could use this as the start of my rehab documentary. I've hated him ever since. Sorry John.
"I almost died in a car crash aged 17. The pain wasn't the worst bit, it was almost dying a virgin. For 15 years I was a complete slut. I'm not sure who fathered my eldest but don't tell my husband that."
I met my father in law at a gay sauna 5 years ago. We looked at each other then went our separate ways. We have never mentioned it but I often see his car at a popular cruising lay-by

"I always say please and thankyou to Siri and Alexa. People think I'm being dumb, but I'll be the one laughing when the robots take over and they keep me alive as a favoured pet."
I once fucked my ass with a carrot and then fed it to my other half's horse
"I have made a series of elaborate hiding places in kitchen for 'my' biscuits lest my 3 teenagers eat them all. I also have less elaborate hiding places that i know they will find. I fill these with crap biscuits. They think they are getting one over on me, but they are WRONG!"
I go on Google maps to the images that were dates as being taken before my dad died so I can walk around a little bit in a world where he is still with me.
Just had my Covid jab and feel totally fine but intending on milking it as much as possible with my partner for additional bed rest and cups of tea
"Bought 35 old comics from a charity shop, priced £2 each, but I haggled down to £50 as I know they're snowed with stock since reopening. Just sold the last one - they went for a combined £2,873. Ah well, maybe I've funded the £50-worth of research that knocks cancer on the..."
"10 years ago my school principal refused to let anyone leave the assembly hall until someone owned up to running into the staff toilet every morning while he was doing his ablutions, blowing a massive fart noise on their arm and running away. It was me. I am the head of music.."
"My girlfriend got into the shower with me to give me a sexy surprise, unfortunately I was pissing up the shower curtain at the time. She was not impressed. I was gutted. I was two octopuses from my personal best."
"If I've just changed the bed, I always make sure my husband finishes off in my mouth for a few days so I can enjoy clean sheets for longer."
My partner is amazing & I love him very much but he has the loudest snore in the world. It's obnoxiously loud to the point I can't sleep next to him. He refuses to even look into anything to help with it. I fear it will break us up soon.
"When my dog takes a poo and my hands are too dry to open the poo bag with, I give him a little stroke so he licks my fingers, thus moistening them enough to open the poo bag"
"In the mid-90s my folks sold their house to one of the band members from Simply Red. The day we moved, I left all the Yellow Pages open at the Music Lessons section. Also, sorry for the massive jizz stain on the carpet upstairs under where my bed used to be."
"Aged 13 on a long, boring driving holiday around Europe with my parents, I rubbed one out under a blanket in the backseat of the car as we were driving. I thought I'd got away with it until my mum asked what the strange smell was and wound down the window."

"I do a cleaning job in the evening for a bit more money, I swear that someone uses a blowtorch on their skid marks just for fun to make it harder for me to scrub off. Dirty bastards."
"I ghost wrote a healthy eating recipe book for a celebrity. The celeb, had no idea about cooking and subsisted on junk food. I nicked the recipes off the Internet and altered them a bit. The book actually did ok...."
I have a fake social media account that I've kept going for absolutely years now just to mess with my ex boyfriend. He's built up a whole online friendship with this other guy as they're both into the same stuff. Zero regrets.
"I worked in a company and quickly realised that none of the work I did there mattered or was noticed. So for a year all I did was download books off the Internet, convert them to Microsoft Word and read them on my monitor so it looked like I was working."

I've been using my sons orthodontic appointments to leave work calls/meetings for at least three years. It's been about 2 years since he even had braces.
"All my pants are black, except two pairs, which are bright orange. These are my warning pants. When I only have them left, I know I need to do the washing."
"I once told a guy who was trying to park on a busy high street that he was performing the worst piece of driving I'd ever seen. He took umbrage & told me to fuck off. I told him he was a cunt & sped off. That night I met my gf's dad for the 1st time. Well, talk about coincidences"
I fancied Roger Taylor in the video for I Want to Break Free

When I'm putting the sprinkler out on the lawn I throw it and pretend to be in the Ghostbusters
I once had a dream where I was having sex with my mother. She was on top and enjoying it. I woke up with a hard-on. Took me months to get the image out of my head when I was wanking or having sex. Still traumatised to this day.
"Worked at McDonald's in the late 90's. Whilst on the till in the drive-thru booth, I used to short-change people by £1 and count cars. After every tenth car I'd shove a tenner in my socks. Used to walk out of there with £150 on busy days. No one ever noticed. Thanks, Ronald."
"When I'm hoovering and need to fart, I'll whip the nozzle round to point at my bum, and extract the fumes directly at source. I'm always oddly satisfied at doing these undetectable 'stealth farts', but find it hard to look Henry in the eye afterwards."
We have a work Spotify playlist which we have all added our favourite songs to. I try to be the first one in so it's running off my phone and I can remove all the songs I don't like from the queue.
"2005. A bank's call centre. One day a footballer in the 2nd tier phoned. £27k, paid fortnightly. It was shocking to see it on the screen. Next caller was a stressed out single mum, in tears and a balance of £9. The job made me angry and ill so I left."
I like to annoy my wife by giving her directions whilst she's driving us to our house. Where we've lived for 13 years.
When I was very young. I thought ''masturbating was where you ran round an athletics track naked. To this day I'm still disappointed that it isn't what I thought it was.
"For 10 years I've been making my wife what she believes to be a vegan pesto. The first time I made it I put in a big fistful of Parmesan, and she loved it so much I've never changed the recipe."
"If my phone goes when I'm on the train, I proudly announce my name and military rank - Major - before instructing them to go ahead. Except I work in insurance. Sometimes I'm a Colonel, or even a Brigadier if I'm feeling especially fancy."

"Female, 28, and got a body cam to film arseholes abusing me while out running. Local NPT love visiting people at home if I get a number plate. So far I've had 2 charged and 1 guy lost his job and I've no regrets."
Whenever I'm polishing wooden surfaces in the house I like to pretend I'm a master craftsman on salvage hunters restoration. I have a monologue in my head explaining what I'm doing. Truth is I can barely put a screw in straight.
I've stayed in hundreds of hotels all over the world.
If an ever stay somewhere truly awful - a place where even the staff have given up - I'll crack open those UHT milks and carefully pour them along the seam of the carpet. Takes a few days to develop. Carpet has to go.
I punched and smashed the family PC monitor after losing in a match on Championship Manager. I pretended to fall down the stairs carrying said PC Monitor to clean it in front of my mother. I ended up in A&E that night by my Dad - I was absolutely fine! They replaced the monitor
Dessert on the menu was Chocolate cake. Out of the goodness in my heart I told a girl I lived with she had chocolate on her lip. She wiped and wiped and never got it off. I told her she got it. Yeah... it was a mole! I couldn't look her in the eye again!
"I'm a carer for my mum, who has dementia. This morning i overheard her talking to my dogs. One of them jumped on her lap & she sang 'melancholy baby' to him, a lullaby she used to sing to me as a child. I've never cried so hard, yet so quietly."
"One thing they don't tell you as a new parent is that a baby will clamp it's mouth to literally any nipple. As a new father, getting up in the night bare chested to soothe your crying child is a whole lot of avoiding your child clamping on to your hairy man nips."
"Planning to scatter my father's ashes, we discussed options for a small social thing afterwards. My suggestion won.No-one else realised how wonderfully inappropriate it was until half way through.We had a BBQ."
"I'm in my mid-40s and there are three or four fairly entertaining stories of mine that I am no longer convinced actually happened. I've been telling them for so long that I can't remember if they're entirely true, exaggerations, or 100% made up."
"When I was younger, I worked for an academic publisher. We'd classify books into textbooks, monographs, readers, major works and the like. Now I've hit middle age and take ages in the bog, I can't help thinking 'that was a major work' after a really big and time-consuming shit."
"When I was a teenager I used to always get mistaken for my dad on the phone, and the calls were almost always for him. Once, when asked 'Is that Mr Kay?' instead of saying 'no, it's his son' I said 'No, it's Master Kay'. I can still feel the shame and embarrassment."
"I worked for a well-known clothes shop and they made us buy their clothes as our 'uniform'. The shoes were particularly bad, hurt, and didnt last. Every time I bought new ones I put the old pair in the box and sent them back for a refund."
"Been a carpenter for 28 years, when I get a new tool I introduce it to my others and tell them to play nice, no bullying in my van."
"After a night at the club I once pissed through the letterbox of a house I thought belonged to a guy who I had a fight with months earlier. Found out the next Monday morning it was a schoolmates house, and a decent bloke too. Sorry Matt"
I'm a lifelong socialist. But I was actually glad when they stopped school milk because it was warm and gross and we were practically forced to drink it.
"Sometimes rather than deleting text I need to change, I meticulously re-use letters and only delete what really must go. For example if I had written essex hologram when I meant fesshole, I'd carefully delete e-x-o-g-r-a-m then add f and e on the end. I don't know why."
When I have a poo I always say to it Goodbye my little ploppies before flushing. Didn't realise a colleague was outside the stall at work once. He now always smirks when he sees me and I hate him.

Had a play fight with a mate go bad & ended up with strangle marks. I was embarrassed & told my friends I'd been attacked by a tramp. My worried friends said I should do a police report so I did a whole police interview about an imaginary crime because I thought they could check
I eat Frosties for breakfast with sugar on every day and have done for the last 8 years- I am a dentist and tell people every day to cut down on sugary foods yet I love Frosties too much
"When I'm depressed I'll put a tenner or so in my pension as a gift to future me, because it cheers me to imagine that by the time I'm 70 there'll be realistic virtual reality, and I can have myself a disgusting robo-geriatric orgy."
"At uni 40 years ago a friend made a tea brewing timer. For a laugh I secretly swapped labels and later watched as the Herbal he sipped didn't seem right, as unknown to him it was timed for Earl Grey! I've been tortured by guilt and self-loathing about my mean trick ever since."
"I had a messy break up with an ex. They left me at the flat to pack up my belongings, as I left I shit in the microwave and cooked it for 30 mins. Unsure what happened to them, the shit or the microwave but it often cheers me up all the different scenarios"
"When I was 12 my uncle took me fishing on a Friday night. We caught a load of mackerel and on the way home he posted five fish through the letterbox of a small firm of solicitors muttering, bloody lawyers. I often wonder how bad that place smelled by Monday morning."
"Worked at the Inland Revenue - before it became HMRC - in Cardiff; was told never sign our real names on letters. I signed random names instead, so if you ever got a letter from Ken Dodd, Lester Piggott, Pol Pot, Owen Money, SuperTed, or Fireman Sam, it was me."
I really want to try pegging with my wife. Rather than talk to her about it like a normal person I just google it on her phone occasionally hoping she gets Facebook ads for strap ons.
"Having had close family members suffer and pass from Alzheimer's, I constantly fear that if I go the same way, in years to come, that I will call my lovely wife by the name of my first love who I still think about all the time."
"I have a fantasy that I'm the lead singer of an anarchist lesbian punk band called the Fizzing Clits. We're performing 'Toxic Pussy' on a chat show. Gary Barlow is the other guest. He weeps and calls us 'un-ladylike', so I slap him."
"I tell my husband that I love being taken from behind. I don't particularly, but I can't stand watching his cum face. He mouth hangs open like a cheap blow up doll. It's repulsive."
"Whenever anyone's coming round to my place I always clear out the medicine cabinet in the bathroom. Everybody takes a peek when they're in someone else's gaff, myself included."
"My ex gave me his families old video camera with a tape still in it. Most of it was holiday footage until the end, where it suddenly switched to his mother masturbating using the cameras night vision mode. It looked like something out of a horror film."
"About 15 years ago I made up a fact about a historic figure on a label in a very small exhibition to be seen by about 20 people. Unfortunately a colleague plagiarised me in an exhibition seen by 25,000 people and I now regularly come across this 'fact' in books & documentaries."

"Mate and I went back to a house with 2 lasses after sesh. Both up for fun. Drunk mate urgently needs loo, timed it horribly wrong and shat on bathroom floor and slipped in it. Cleaned him and bathroom to a standard Pulp Fiction's Mr Wolf would be proud. Both of us had a shag too."
"My dental hygienist tells me to floss everyday. She asks how often I floss. I pull my best apologetic face and say once or twice a week. I'm lying. I never floss. She knows I never floss. She knows I'm lying. I don't know why I lie. I'm a 51-year-old man, not a schoolboy."
Every summer my neighbour buys awful wind chimes that I have to sneak into their garden and break.They've not bought any yet and I'm actually a bit disappointed.
I sometimes don't go for a poo when I need one as I like to pretend I'm a kangaroo carrying around a baby joey in my pouch
After my mum died I cleared her house and sold it. I found one of the remote controls for her garage door a year or so later when going through a box. I put it my car and deviate at least once a month now to drive passed her old home and open the door up remotely. Makes me smile!
"I bought my 78 year old mum a Kindle to help get her through lockdown, linked it to my Amazon Prime account, and told her to download whatever she wanted. Since then she's been downloading two or three filthy books a week. She doesn't know I know and I'm keeping my mouth shut."

"Whilst trying to learn how to use a mooncup, I read that your cervix is meant to feel like the tip of your nose. Now whenever I touch my nose I imagine it's my cervix."
Came home after a night out around 3am. Except I went to my parents old house which they had sold years before. Banged on the door for ages after my key didn't work. Elderly man eventually opened up and slammed the door in my face. Deserved.
"I once heard a pornographic film actress call herself a 'cock pig' in a grumble flick, and now whenever I see an advert for Moon Pig, I cheerfully sing 'cock pig dot com' when the jingle comes on at the end."
"When I was fourteen we got Cable TV, the bills were received by email in HTML.I explained to my Dad that I could edit them so he agreed to subscribe to Playboy TV.Each month I removed the 7.99 for that and added some fake itemised calls to my Sisters boyfriend which she paid for."
I've lived in the same rented house for 12 years. 10 years ago it was repossessed by the bank and we stopped paying the rent. We've never heard another word. It seems it's just been forgotten about

"On a Friday at the pub a mate brought his army mate out and I spent all night talking to him about my vast and varied military experience. We embraced as brothers when he left. Thing is, I'm in sales and just watch a lot of war films."
"My job in the 1990's was to survey sites for cell towers. I was sent to a specific rural location to survey and confirm a huge cell tower could be erected. It was a beautiful location, so I lied and said it was too sandy to be built on and remain stable."
My wife and I did a message in a bottle in 1999 for our son to find. We dated it 1956 and from another continent. We planted the bottle on the beach but then couldn't find it. 3 weeks later it was front page news in our local newspaper. We didn't own up.
"Got caught travelling without a ticket by BTS, gave the name and address of the lady few doors away, year or so later heard her arguing with a bailiff saying she never uses trains. I was laughing at least I got a bit of revenge for her cat constantly shitting on my new decking."
"My wife of 30 years has become a flag-shagging jingo-troll. Even though both her elderly parents died of Covid, she still thinks Boris Johnson can do no wrong. It's terrifying to see someone I once loved go completely insane. Divorcing ASAP."
"Whenever I am in a group of people, supermarket, work, with friends etc I always try to work out who has had a shit already that day, who needs a shit and who is an afternoon shitter and it's not fully baked. I have no idea why but do it daily and have no intentions of stopping."
"During our 2nd and 3rd year at uni, our landline no. was incorrectly printed in a York guidebook. We got loads of phone calls from people trying to book rooms. Eventually we started taking bookings. Sorry if you turned up to the Golden Fleece in 2003 & your room wasn't available."
"Everyone thinks that about 20 years ago, a mate's mad ex broke into our shared house and chopped up a soft toy in an act of revenge.It was me. He needed to realise she was bad news and that was the only thing I could think of to make him see sense. Sorry about the toy Womble."

"Walking back from the cinema one night I came across some roadworks marked out with linemarker paint. The can was nearby, so I marked out a few more areas and labelled them with sequential numbers, as such I like to think I'm partially responsible for the shape of the M6's J10"

I've been an Anglican priest for 30 years. I love everything about my job and wouldn't do anything else. But I don't believe in God. I reckon a decent sized minority of my peers are the same.
"I get jealous on the family chat when they start talking gardens as I don't have one. My sister sends pics of plants she's found and asks us to ID them. I jump in first and follow up with advice. They are in awe and think I'm the new Monty Don, but I just use Google Lens."
I had a colleague return to work after battling stomach cancer and getting the all clear. He annoyed the hell out of me. I quickly realise that if I dropped silent farts near him he'd think it was his stoma bag and would sod off for half an hour to empty or change it.
"I've spent thousands over the years on music: CDs, LPs, cassettes and gigs. But just now I signed up to a vpn and torrented about a hundred albums. I figure my previous contributions mean I get this as a favour."
"I'd run out of bog roll so I used an old sock and flushed it, did the same the next day. Turns out the manhole for the sewer was under the floor in the flat below and it was spraying shit out. It was two socks blocking it apparently. Lent him some Febreze and he was so grateful."
Driving my son home from football this evening and Shake it Off comes on and I start singing along like I always do because it's a banger. I look round and my son is looking at me with a look of abject disappointment which absolutely crushed me. I'm a 45 year old man.
"Remember when Innocent Smoothies had little wooly hats for charity? I would buy them, and go back home, get naked, and work myself into an engorged erection, and burst into the living room to my ex-girlfriend with a TA-DA, wearing the woolly hat over the helmet of my penis."
"I am a wildlife photographer and sit in hides and waits for days for birds / deer. Imagine my surprise when I saw 12 people gather in a forest clearing 30 meters from my hide, get naked do a wired ceremony and fuck! I felt more scared than any time in my life."
"As a 14 year old I sneaked into the school hall where the majorettes were practicing their baton twirling, waited for a bit when they all threw them in the air, then turned off all the lights and ran away. I can still hear the screams as batons rained down on their heads."
I've convinced the kids that vitamins are a legitimate pudding in our house
My wife likes to tell people that I drink 5 pints on our first date. I protest that it wasn't that many. I'd had a couple before she showed up.
Sometimes when I go to the bathroom I do a heel click and give a full on Nazi salute. I have NO idea why I do this and am not a Nazi but it seems like the thing to do.
"While drunk, I once dropped an entire 14 takeaway pizza face down into my bathroom sink. I recovered it and scraped the toppings back on. My posh friends commented on the amazing use of mint - the leaves were spinach and the mint flavour was toothpaste."

"When I leave my car in a car park, I like to pour water onto the ground leaving a trail from the car of about 20 feet. I'll then grab a book of matches from my pocket, light a cigarette & then drop the lit match on the ground. In my head I'm Tony Soprano & the water's petrol."
I put items in the foodbank basket in Supermakets without paying for them whenever I can. Just call me Robin Hood I guess.
"I work with a man who sneezes in the most obnoxiously pantomime way, far louder than is necessary. Fully vocalised. I hear him 3 floors up. Assuming no one has ever called him out for it. Deeply unpleasant. Sometimes want to kill him."
When I was a young and stupid kid my friend managed to convince me that you can't hit yourself in the balls it's like how you can't tickle yourself. You can. Trust me.

"Back in the days of Sinclair Computers, I would go into Dixons, key in a bit of code and have the screens light up flashing obscenities. The staff were so crap they didn't know anything about computers so would be panicking and eventually have to just unplug them."
"When I was a student in the 90s, I poured bleach on my housemates marijuana seedlings. I've never been sorry about it, I didn't want the drama when the university found out."
I only recently found out the singer Pato Banton was not Irish and his name was not actually Pat O'Banton
"I always click like on the facebook posts where my friends thank everyone for the birthday wishes, but those birthday wishes were never from me."
"I'm a tall man, when walking through unpruned trees on the pavement, I pretend my head is an x fighter as I zoom between branches"
I am very against brexit. Was very vocal to my friends & family about this. I didn't vote because I was working & didn't arrange a postal vote. I wasn't concerned as I never thought it would never happen. My vote could of made a difference. How many people were like me? FUCK!
"Maybe it's because I'm approaching 40, but I still think of the ribbon or whatever it's called in Microsoft Word as new-fangled nonsense and ignore it in favour of the actual old-school menus. It drives people crazy when they're watching over my shoulder."
When I buy a large salad from the supermarket fresh counter I always scan it through as a small at self service

I finished with a guy I was dating because he looked slightly like Matt Hancock. I just got the ick after realising the similarity and it could ever be unseen.
"A tradesman was a complete bell end driving on the road. Got the number off the net and asked him for a quote really far away but for a decent big job, worth your while. Then blocked his number. No regrets."
"When out walking I try to pace myself so that when I go from one type of pavement or concrete to another the number of steps I take on each surface is a power of 2 i.e. 4, 8,32 etc. I've been doing it for decades & can't switch it off. I reckon it's the only unique thing about me"
5 years ago I met a married older lady on a well-known dating app & messed around with her causally for a few months before drifting apart. Found out yesterday she's my sister's boyfriend's aunt. Going to a family BBQ she'll be at on Sunday. She doesn't know yet. Should be fun.
"I have a gross and secret ritual whenever I eat Mini Cheddars. I half eat one, chew it up a bit, and then spit it onto a fresh one as if it's a fancy topping. I then eat both and repeat the ritual, and see how much fancy topping I can fit onto a fresh, dry one."
When at home I go up the stairs on all fours like a toddler. I'm 54 and my wife has never once commented in it.
"Whenever I make my sons sandwiches for his school lunch, I squirt the ketchup in the shape of a cock and balls. Don't know why, but I have no intention of stopping."
When I pee into a toilet I flush the toilet before I finish peeing and try to time it to finish flushing at the same time I finish peeing..I know it means some pee remains unflushed but it brings me pleasure when it's timed perfect
My wife has started using the phrase for all intents and purposes but insists on pronouncing it intensive purposes. I have decided that it is best to let her carry on and look like an idiot than go through the trauma of trying to correct her.
"I moved to Scotland from North West England a while ago and every time I go back home I take shortbread for the family, my Nan particularly raves on about how its the best she has ever tasted and wishes she could buy it in England. Its from Poundland, sorry Nan."
Wearing a mask in the pandemic has completely cured me of my knicker sniffing habit. At 67 years old I have finally realised that its only a bit of cloth in front of my nose. And I'm a high court judge.
My partner gives me healthy lunches to take to work everyday in an attempt to help me lose weight. Thankfully my secret snack draw allows me to lead a double food life.
"The year is 2007. 7 year old me gave our family dog a finger of a Twix. The dog died. I hid the other Twix finger under my 5 year old step sisters bed and blamed her. My plan worked, mum told my step dad she couldn't stay in our house anymore. I got my attention back."
"The film 'Hot Fuzz' is the most accurate portrayal of policing I have ever seen. I was a copper for 30 years in the deepest west country, and the film was frighteningly realistic."
"Whilst waiting, I listen out for the name people give when collecting prescriptions in the pharmacy. A quick search of the local Facebook news and gossip page and then I know where they stand on dog shit, vandals, youth crime, Brexit, etc"
"After scratching my itchy ring piece, I wiped my cheesy arse grease fingers on our cat's head. My girlfriend smelt the cat, gagged, called it a dirty bastard and bathed it. It went crazy and slashed her arms. She still has the scars."

I called in to see an old friend with my son. He was so happy to see me and messaged me after saying we shouldn't leave it so long next time and how good it was catching up. I only went round there to show my son how shit his life could be if he kept smoking weed.
We made egg tempera paint at school in the style of the Renaissance. Teacher complimented me on my palette not knowing the rich brown was made from my own shit
"I was reminiscing about being a child in the 80s, things like prank calling 999 and Child Line, turning on outdoor taps and running away and throwing stones at passing trains spring to mind. I now realize what a bunch of horrible little pricks my friends and I were."
"I am 21, female, & my brother is 19. I borrowed his laptop & he has written lots of short stories about boys being shrunken down and accidentally eaten by their older sisters. I've been dying to tease him about this but also know I shouldn't bring it up. It's weirdly hilarious."
My sister is an Instagram influencer and regularly gets DMs from men asking for pictures. Several times we have taken photos of my arse in her underwear and send them back. I am 26 and a man. It seems to work for them
"I can't believe I'm going to admit this, even anonymously, but... here goes. I didn't see a snail until I was in my mid 20s"
"Therapy to be more assertive isn't working. Decided to stop, but first thing therapist said was Over the next 6 months we will... and I wasn't willing to correct their assumption, so I guess I'm stuck now."
I'm a primary school teacher who doesn't know his times tables. I rely on my clever kids to answer them. The deliberate mistakes I make every day are not deliberate. I'm an absolute fraud.
"I love my husband, but his taste in music is dreary adolescent toss. I make it bearable by mentally adding the amen break to every song I have to listen to."
"I love my wife dearly and truly want to spend the rest of my life with her. But I can never tell her that I don't remember matching with her on the dating app we met on, or how I wasn't even that interested initially when we spoke."
I lost a game of Connect 4 to my friend's 5-year old son. His Dad thanked me for letting the boy win. I didn't let him win.
Always had a dream of a boy and 2 girls. I've been granted that but the plan was me and the boy go to football together and live the life I wanted as a kid. Turns out the 2 girls are amazing and the 8 year old boy is a horrible little cunt.
I'm a married man and I go on dating apps like pof for wanking material. It's amazing how many hot women take their panties off after a few mins for am online play and send sexy pictures. I guess it could always be men catfishing me but I enjoy it.
"Had a Saturday job 1980s , in a small electrical shop . A very rude man came in and demanded we repair his Sony Walkman. On inspection we found he had the batteries back to front. So charged him £7.50+VAT to fix it. Serves him right. Politeness costs nothing."
Fairly certain I accidentally saw my son lose his virginity behind the bins of the pub I run. 
"He was drunk/stupid enough not to see the cctv camera, and i watched the footage a few hours later to see why the motion sensor had been tripped. It was brief."
"My wife had a very large black cock vibrator. Forgetting to put it away after a session, our dog found it and bought down while we were hosting Christmas lunch.....10 family members pretending to ignore the do chewing on a 12 inch cock."
"Used delay spray. To be safe I did 10 sprays. Hands covered in it, got peckish and made a sandwich. 20 minutes later I was struggling to talk. Wife called 111, she thought I was having a stroke, an hour later I'm in A&E. After an ECG, CT Scan and 6 hours of obs I was sent home."

I used to work on the London Stock Exchange. Before Northern Rock went under I saw it was about to happen and managed to get my £100k ish of savings into another bank about 2 hours before it hit the news and the other NR customers lost everything.
"In Norfolk as a kid with a friend. A man down the cliff face by the sea was taking photos of the local scenery & wildlife. My mate and I found a dead rabbit nearby and hung it over the handlebars of his bike. We wrote in chalk on the path next to the bike, 'you're next'. Sorry."
Had sex with a guy when drunk forgetting I had a tampon still in 
After he said the sex was even better than usual and it felt like there was a little vagina inside ny vagina grabbing his penis 
I let him think that I have a magic pussy might do it to another guy sometime
Worked in a shoe shop. It had three flights of brutally steep stairs to get to the stockrooms. If a customer needed a pair from the top floor it was always pause at the back and then sorry we haven't got that in your size.
If I need a wee in the shower whilst my wife is also in the bathroom then I like to pretend I'm in the videogame Metal Gear Solid and I'm trying to piss as stealthily as possible so as not to alert the guards.
"After a night out I saw two girls two gardens down, who invited me over for a spliff. I climbed over the fences, knocking over a plant pot. Next day the police knocked at my door. I had destroyed the neighbour's memorial statue for her stillborn baby and now have criminal reco..."
"When I overtake people on the motorway, I look at the person driving the other car, and do an impression of their face just after I've passed them."
I switched the push & pull signs on all the doors at my workplace. I work at a funeral parlour.
"A journalist I was having an affair with won an award for reporting on a major event. He was first on the scene because at the time of the incident, he was in a hotel room next to the site, balls deep in me."
"I was having an affair with my now husband & was heartbroken every time he went home to his wife. Once in a hotel room in London, in the heat of the moment, I scratched my initial into his arse while he was on top. I felt guilty afterwards but marking my territory felt important"
"I'm a working musician. 50-60% of the guitar parts I have invented are other guitar players' guitar parts, but played in reverse."
I worked in a bar in Luton which had an event hall. When the music was loud I'd say 'who's a wanker?' Instead of who's next please. Watching people raise their hand would bring a smile to my face
"Traded my modern, reliable, economical car in for an old Porsche. My wife knows the trade was break-even. She doesn't know I've spent thousands getting it roadworthy. I have no regrets."
When I was a postman I had a large delivery of cards for an elderly woman. As she open the door I said happy birthday. It's not my birthday she replied  my husband died 2 days ago.. I should have realised as there was no money jingling in the cards. I felt such a fool.
When slipping it to the wife from behind and she looks back at me over her shoulder I get Over my Shoulder by Mike and the Mechanics stuck in my head.
"I once got my best friend to ring my girlfriend and tell her that I was breaking up with her whilst I sat in the room with him listening to the conversation. He did a great job, highly commendable and let her down gently. I would recommend him for that line of work at any time."
When I lived on my own I realised I'd just had a conversation with a piece of wafer thin ham

"I got weary of the usual porn and started using just my imagination while jacking off. It's much better, and has had the unexpected bonus of I'm getting wet dreams for the first time in twenty years. There's your top tip, lads."
"I once shit myself so badly as a teenager and was embarrassed to let my mum see what a fucking mess I am, so I hid my shitty boxer shorts in a neighbours tree, years later there was talk in the street of a tramp living in one of the gardens, they had found his underwear."
"As a teen, I spent quite a lot of time trying to find the American city of Utero on a map. Y'know, where Nirvana recorded that album."
"I sat opposite Rebekah Murdoch's lapdog Brooks on a train once. Like a dead-inside Nicole Kidman. I wish I could've said some deeply clever, cutting, persuasive remark that would have set her on the righteous path, to turn whistleblower and expose her boss's evil empire."
Cheated on my wife. Feel really bad about it. Not that I cheated on my wife but that the one I did it with was a 5/10 while my Mrs is a solid 8. Beer goggles suck.
"Incautiously mentioned to the boyfriend that I was suffering from some vaginal discomfort and minor bleeding. He was full of sympathy and looked up cycsitis, UTIs etc and coddled me. I'd actually been trying out my new, rather cheap and nasty vibrator without lube."
I put my SIM card into my mate's phone because my battery had run out. It transferred all his numbers to my SIM card. I started messaging his sister. We arranged to meet blind date style. I realised how much she looked like him. I shagged her anyway.
Sometimes when I'm squeezing a blackhead I mentally sing Reservoir of Grease to the My Empire of Dirt line from Johnny Cash's Hurt
"I have a massive hatred of dogs ever since a sniffer dog wouldn't leave me alone at the airport on a school trip. They obviously found nothing as I was 12, but I got a massive bollocking from the teacher and have been stuck with the nickname 'smuggler' for years."
I wanted to boycott Wetherspoons due to their owner being horrible through Covid. I've been 4 times for breakfast this week.
"When the mrs is in bed and I fancy a quick wank I get two sheets of kitchen roll, but in case the neighbours are watching I'll pretend to wipe the benches down first"
"Wherever I have worked or studied, I have always had a favourite toilet cubicle. Used to love finding a quiet one where no one else would go. Peace."
"I once gate-crashed a house party in London when I was 20 or so. There was a long queue for the loo on the 4th floor. Come my turn I went in, locked the door and then climbed out the window and scaled the drainpipe. I re-entered the house and re-joined the queue for the loo."
I told my kids pigeons self destruct when they die and that - rather than the cat - is why there are big piles of feathers in the garden. My 13 year old has been a little embarrassed in biology class today
I've started wearing my reading glasses to roll joints. Fuck I'm old.
"When me and my wife watch Gogglebox together we laugh harder and say funnier things to each other, just in case there's a wee camera in the telly and they're recording us for next week."
"Went to the toilet and when I bent over to wipe, the Airwick air freshener that squirts every few minutes puffed directly into my asshole and it stung for about 3 days afterwards."

"I was in a coma for 7 weeks. How satisfying it was to pick my nose for the first time, after oxygen lines and grown finger nails, is indescribable."
"I work for the prison service and most officers are as, if not more, manipulative, selfish and difficult as prisoners."
"When I saw the TV show Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge, I thought it was a the most shittiest chat show ever and Alan Partridge was awfuI. I didn't realise it was all a spoof until my sister told me yesterday."
"My wife is 36 years old, we recently visited a local zoo and much to her surprise she discovered bears aren't infact make-believe"
I think I've managed to complete XHamster during the course of Covid.
"Used to work for a major UK bank. We were explicitly encouraged to sell credit cards/overdrafts etc to people who couldn't afford them, so they'd be buried by interest and be in debt forever. I was sacked for refusing to sell a struggling single mum a credit card she didn't need"
I've never willingly watched a game of football. My colleagues think I'm an expert on the game. They don't realise I'm just repeating what I heard the pundits say on the radio news update on my drive into work.
"I did a two week drain replacement job - high quality and hard work. The bloke refused to pay and then went to ground. 6 months later he was driving a new BMW, so poured concrete into his drain."
"Sorry mum, your secret crisp supply wasn't raided by dad. It was me, your oldest son. I spotted them in your wardrobe which you'd left open when I went to get more loo roll from your en-suite for the downstairs toilet."
"When I was 21 I told my friends I'd had 8 sexual partners. Truth was only 3. I'm now 43 and have successfully got my number up through suggesting threesomes to my wife. I'm not even that into it anymore, it's purely been to fulfill that lie I told at the George and Dragon in 1999"
"Had a dream last night that I made scrambled eggs and bananas and it tasted AMAZING. Convinced I'd made an incredible discovery, I cooked it this morning. Surprisingly, a complete waste of eggs bananas and time."
Years ago my wife got so drunk at a Christmas do she shat herself in bed. I cleaned her and the bed up while she remained unconscious. Neither of us ever mentioned it and I honestly think she has no memory of it. But every time we argue I'm tempted to bring it up.
I told a female friend that guys hold their balls when they poo or they get skidmarks. Unbeknown to me she went and asked her bf if he did. He said no. So she called him Pooballs for the next month.
I was on a night out and one of my friend Ryan's mother was out on a hen-do. She was recently divorced and ended up coming back to my dingy houseshare where she blew my mind in bed. I loved it until she said I bet you wish Ryan could see us now
"Once didn't buy a house I liked because the seller was a photographer, who had plastered the walls with his own wildlife photos. I mean hundreds and hundreds of them. They were everywhere. What a creepy bastard."
I am ashamed to say that I have successfully flicked the bean to Big Bang Theory parody porn. It has been a long lock down. And it is a strong vibrator to be fair.

"My boyfriend seems to think I don't see all his creepy replies to female TV presenters on Twitter. I'd leave him, but his flat's nicer than mine and I've learned to tune most of it out."
"I used to have nightmares as a child that the giant floating 'it could be you' hand from the national Lottery program would turn up at my window and take me away from my parents, still creeps me out to this day."
"I love my girlfriend - she is gorgeous, intelligent, funny, kind and great in bed. But my god seeing her eating is gross. I can't look at her. Especially when she is jamming down the rind off a pork chop."
I can cum from rubbing my belly button. I think it probably means I have a hernia but I'm not gonna do anything about it.
"When I was about 8, there used to be this obese kid called Keith. He was very fat and unable to bend over. He took the class gerbil home one holiday and it died. We started a rumour that he ate it. I regret my actions to this day. Sorry Keith."
"Have only just this week realised that the regular towel goes around the waist, and the bath sheet goes around the shoulders. I'm a bloke in his 40's."
I looked up and learned all the words to the Snoop Dogg Just Eat rap so I could join in whenever the ad comes on TV or radio. I only do this when I'm alone and I'm really good at it now.
"When I was about nine I visited Buckingham Palace with my Mum and needed to pee whilst on the tour. No public toilets inside. Mum handed me an empty Fruit Shoot bottle to piss in in corner, which proceeded to overflow and I ended up pissing over the walls of the State Room"
"My housemate lost his job 2 yrs ago, but pretends to still have one.I know lots of his work colleagues. I go along with it, if he's putting all of this effort in to maintain the charade, I'm not going to spoil it for him.He's living off an inheritance he doesn't know I know about"
"15 years ago I had a 2 year period where I pulled off a couple of deals that single handedly saved the company I work for. In the last 5 years my performance has been awful, but I'm kept on through loyalty. Anyone else would have been fired. I wish they would, to be honest."
"I matched with someone on Tinder just before the first covid lockdown, ghosted him and thought nothing of it since. He got a job at my workplace and I'm now I'm his supervisor. Awkward"
When I took my Microsoft exams about 20 years ago I downloaded the answers from the internet and learned them in about 2 hours before each exam.
"My husband is an incredibly sexy man. But he farts a LOT. Not smelly, but the big, wet ripping sound deeply disgusts me every time. It's gotten to the point that I'm considering divorcing him because I can't live with it anymore."
"A guy I remember from school has phoned my office and asked for a job twice now. We do need staff, but he once threatened to kill my then 3 year old brother with a baseball bat, so I'm not sure he will be starting any time soon."
"When we had our kitchen done 5 years ago, I changed the order of knives, forks and spoons in the cutlery drawer. I've never been happy with the new arrangement but am too stubborn to change it back."
As a police officer in the 1980s - I can now confess that I was afraid of the dark.
"I thought getting a dog would give me some companionship while working from home, which it does but everytime it craps in the house I feel like a total failure. Just adding to my professional failings."
I am jealous of divorced dads who only see their kids every other weekend. That sounds brilliant.

Was invited to Epstein's Manhattan home. We spent two hours talking about rehypothecation of collateralized loan obligations.
"I grew up in the country and knew all the spots to find discarded pornography. My formative years involved a lot of long walks and damp pages of Fiesta. Even now on walks with my kids I can't help but notice potential porno spots, but the internet has put an end to all that."
I was bullied at a snooker club so took a shit in a snooker table pocket and said brown to myself in the hushed tones of Ted Lowe

Just accidentally had my first service station gloryhole experience. Actually just needed a shit but seemed rude not to.

Had a friend that worked in Topshop. Together we stole about £500 of clothes in one go by pretending to ring items through and acting out a card transaction. Split the bounty afterwards.
I run a company on Etsy selling cartoon versions of pet pictures. All I do is use an app that's widely available for free. I do an hours work a day. Last month earned £5k

"I design book covers for a publisher. I am embarrassed that quite frequently, I make more money than the author."
"When sex was still mysterious, my friend - now a vicar - told me he'd seen a hardcore jazz mag and in the photos of people doing it there was weird white stuff everywhere. So I thought that during sex, both parties secreted a white goo all over their bodies, out of their skin."
"I've never done any drugs or smoked, and I only really drank 'a lot' in my 20s. I'm 41 now, and look loads younger than all of my mates. I don't regret a single thing as I have won the long game."
"I had some money worries at the start of lockdown so created an OnlyFans account. It has not been as financially lucrative as some people made it to be, and now I'm worried that when I go for a proper job again I'll be recognised"
"I've struggled with issues with alcohol for years and thought I got on top of them about 7 years ago. But bloody Uber Eats makes it so easy, the bad decision is made so quickly. The trip to the shop used to give me time to reconsider, now it's happened before my brain engages."
"I'm a professional footballer and I've loved not having fans in the ground over the last year. No abuse or criticism for making a mistake, just get on with the game and go home. I'm gutted fans are coming back, so many of them are utter wankers."

"I have absolutely no regrets about being a prostitute through university, I left debt free with a house deposit saved and had some terrific sex with regular punters. I miss the excitement of being picked up now I'm a boring mom and wife."
"I fancy my husband's boss and he fancies me and we both know it. There is nothing we can ever do about it but hold each other's glances for longer and think maybe next lifetime. My husband got a 30k bonus this year, I like to think a little of that was down to me"
I travel a lot for work and stay in hotels. When I check in I always 'accidentally' make sure the staff see a few fake passports and hear me on the phone taking in code to pretend I'm an international spy. I sell kitchen units.
I indirectly mocked someone in a tweet for having an interest-only mortgage. He reported it to the police. They actually rang me about it. The brush with the law made me feel like Tony Soprano.
After being together a long time I was shocked to find a porn mag under my architect boyfriend's mattress - I know but I was. Replaced it with an architectural drainage mag.
"Years ago, I was really into scat porn. I booked an escort and had her shit in my mouth. As the shit started to fill my mouth, I realised I'd made a massive mistake. I let the shit fall out my mouth, and managed to get through the hour with her. I'm no longer into scat porn."
"On a residential school trip, I spotted a pair of soiled boxers next to a boy in the changing room. He was quickly nicknamed Billy the skid. He got into a lot of fights cos of the name. I'm sorry, William, I came up with that name to protect me from the fact they were my pants"
"Sometimes I when I'm cooking on my gas hob, I pretend I'm a drum and bass DJ and I mix by turning up the nobs on my cooker up and down. I'm a mum of two in my late 40s."
I give my cat hugs when I'm naked because I love the feeling of his fur against my breasts. He begrudgingly tolerates it. I'm pretty certain it doesn't count as animal abuse.
"I live in a flat on a busy town centre street. There is noise and regular sirens/blue lights going past. There is a Chinese TakeAway directly opposite. If I get home when it's dark and raining, I pretend I'm Rick Deckard."
A colleague and I got some coke for a works night out. We shared some of it through the night but she got so drunk later that she passed out. Took her home and put her on the couch. In the morning I told her she must've finished it but I really kept the rest myself. Sorry Claire.
My husband is impressed that I buy lots of beautiful lingerie. I don't. My lover buys it for me.
"I work in a very high security area for a big organisation. To get into the most secure area, you need to scan your fingerprint. It doesn't work for everyone and the workaround is to use a 'universal rubber finger' - kept in the unlocked top draw of the secretary who sits outside"
"To pay my way through my MSc, I escorted. The most money I earned was from a guy who paid me to type on my laptop with long nails. I would do work toward my MSc, while he just sat in an armchair and listened. He paid me £800 for two hours and I visited him twice a month."
"Worked on the VIP line at a call centre. Sometimes I'd note the address and look it up on Google Earth at home. Not many big mansions with swimming pools, it's mainly a semi in Putney or a flat in Islington. I'm not a stalker, just like looking at nice houses."

"On holiday as lads, I swapped my mate's suntan lotion for one I filled with spunk collected over a year. It stank and he got such bad sunburn on the first day he couldn't leave the apartment for a week."
One of my neighbours pops round every 3 months or so to tell me he's going on holiday and to give me a key in case of emergency. He collects it 2 weeks later and gives me a bottle of wine. I have no idea who he is or where he lives.
"My mate was a bit of a rogue, whenever I did something that upset the missus I would blame him for leading me astray.Tbh he always kept an eye on me and stopped me doing a lot worse stuff.I'm sorry you couldn't attend my birthday party cos the missus didn't want you in our house."
"I like to pretend I'm a cleaner working for the mob when I'm cleaning the kitchen after we've made dinner, it might seem sad but it actually cuts alot of the procrastination time down"
I keep my anal douche in the shower so I can thoroughly clean my arse after my daily morning dump! My kids also love playing with it in the bath and spray water at each other with it and ask for the big red bubble gun.
"Back in the early 80's I was collecting Flash Gordon stickers, and so was my best mate. I knew she had the sticker I needed so I nicked it from her coat pocket. I told her it was one of her friends. They hardly ever spoke again and I felt awful. Completed the album though."
Sat in a bar opposite our apartment in Tenerife on a lads holiday. One of the guys went back to get showered and changed. The full bar were in hysterics as we watched his silhouetted figure knocking one out in his room. We lied about what we were laughing at when he got back.
Im a trucker and I was parked up in a layby south of London one sunny morning I watched on in fascination at all the gay cruising going on.
"I now see it in most laybys, bloody hell you lot are a right bunch of randy fuckers."
"I am a traffic warden. If anyone is particularly rude when arguing their case, I tell them that I agree and that I'll cancel the ticket. I don't actually cancel it and they end up with a bigger fine for not paying. Don't be a prick"
"As court reporter, I noticed the name of an old teacher on one of the upcoming sentencings for a paedo. Spent the entire day waiting for his trial seething with rage & the relief when it turned out just to be someone with the same name made me cry. Sorry I doubted you Mr Hicks."
When I left my Saturday job I taped a frozen kipper under my boss's desk. Got an angry phonecall from him a fortnight later after he'd had Rentokil in to cure the mystery smell. Thought it was hilarious at the time but now realise it was a real dick move.
"Guys, bathroom cleaning is the easiest! It's all mild solvents & sponging. Takes me about 10 mins to get the sink, bath and tiles clean, sweep the floor, polish mirrors, Toilet Duck the loo. I do it when the wife's out & she bloody loves it. Odds on for a blowie that night too..."
"Every morning, I split open an 'all natural' cat calming pill and spread the contents on her food to chill her out. Then I fill the shell with a dab of speed to help me on my way."
"I love the feel of a brand new, unread book. There is nothing worse than a book with a bent spine or ceased pages. I now find I can't bear to read any new books I buy, so I always purchase a Kindle version as well, and put the unread physical copy in my bookcase."
"Every time an ambulance or fire engine drives past with blues-and-twos going, I take comfort that someone somewhere is having a worse day than I am..."
When I was a student I went to a party and got very drunk. Me and a friend stole a sofa from the house where the party was and put it on top of somebody's car. I never heard what happened after that but still feel the shame 30 years on.
"Sometimes when I'm having a particularly pleasing shit, I like to imagine i am a machine in Willy Wonkas factory, plopping out everlasting gobstoppers."

"I rarely use any text speech yet use 'atm' fairly frequently in messages. It might mean 'at the moment', but whenever I type it, I always chuckle to myself and say softly out loud 'ass to mouth'."
"I was offered a demotion at work to reduce management overheads. It's improved my mental health, I finish work early every day, and I even earn more money because I get paid overtime for doing the exact same amount of hours. Even got paid a lump sum for taking the job. 😎"
A man on a stag do told me they all had a challenge to get a pair of women's underwear by the end of the night. My friend agreed to sell hers to him for £50. She'd got them off and was about the hand them over when I undercut her and sold my thong for £40. Sorry not sorry Fiona
When I got divorced I offered to sell the boat we jointly owned and hadn't used for a few years. It had been damaged in a storm and was only worth £4k. At least that's what I told her when I handed £2k over. I kept the other £7k.
Split up with a guy. Few months later was chatting to a new lad online & got invited to his place. It was the old boyfriends flat. So I shagged his new fella & got my old trainers back.
30 years ago I was a lone copper on night foot patrol. I disturbed a burglary in progress.The thieves made off over roofs pursued by me until I caught and arrested them. In daylight I found I'd jumped over 60ft drops between shops in pursuit. I still have nightmares.
I once used a pair of scissors to cut up a poo that wouldn't flush when I was at my auntie's house. I washed them and put them back in the kitchen drawer where I found them. Then I watched my auntie use them to spatchcock a chicken. I've been veggie ever since.
"To lighten the mood, I tapped my mum on the shoulder with my dead uncle's prosthetic hand when we were clearing out his flat. Almost killed her."
"While doing the grocery shop online my wife had written sanitary towels, seeing a choice with different sizes I text her to ask what size vagina she had as a joke. Unfortunately sent it to my mum as she was the last person I had text."
Once when I was skint I wrote a complaint to Domino's to say one of the orders I collected was supposed to be veg but had somehow ended up with meat on it. They sent me a £25 voucher code. I completely made it up and just wanted some free pizza.
"Thinking I was a clever little boy, I wrapped a brick from the garden in a shoe box for Mum's Christmas. Only dawned on me as I saw the joy on her face from a surprise present, to then see the utter and total disappointment on opening it. Still haunts me, 40 years later."
"Had to remove a small dead tree and some rotten decking from the garden when I moved in, so I brought an axe and crowbar. Undecided on which sort I needed I went of the ones I thought would do best in the inevitable zombie apocalypse."
One of the posh houses on my running route has a robot lawn mower. I call it Lawnimus Prime and have crafted a detailed back story involving his people's struggles against the evil Scarifiercons led by Flymotron. I'm 45.
I used to work for someone who had dyslexia and struggled with spelling. He was also an arsehole. 
He used to get me to spell check his emails. The higher up the ladder the email was going the more outrageous I used to make the spellings. 
Count is a great word.
"My boss got sacked for bullying people. He never bullied me to be honest, I just joined in the allegations because I fancied a go at applying for his job."
I work at a theatre that was visited by r̶e̶d̶a̶c̶t̶e̶d̶ ̶r̶o̶y̶a̶l̶ for a tour. A friend popped into the loo after she'd used it and noticed one drop of wee on the seat. She mopped it up with a bit of loo roll and we stuck it on our office notice board.
"I recently produced an unexpectedly well-received documentary podcast series. I didn't expect it to get quite so much attention, otherwise I wouldn't have made up as many of the surprising facts and figures that made it so interesting."

I'm a night owl. Husband is an early riser. Sometimes I pretend to be asleep in the morning so I can listen to him sing songs about our cat while he showers. He only does it when he thinks I'm asleep. It's adorable.
As a child I once flicked a bogey at Noel Edmonds when he came to open my school fete. I saw it cling to his argyle sweater. I wonder what journey it went on.
"My friend is a shit painter but after expressing mild appreciation of a painting once, I now get an ugly canvas every birthday. Scared to get rid in case she passes and sees them all in the bin or local charity shop window."
"I'm a private dentist. You don't need that £6k set of braces I've recommended and yes, I do get a kick back from the orthodontist if you go ahead with them."
I'm a West End performer and I've seen at least three blow jobs taking place in the boxes of the theatre auditorium mid show.
"I sometimes used to fantasize about having a sex slave chained up in a basement. But then I realised I'd have to feed them every day, and it would cost a fortune to heat the place, and I don't even have a cellar"
Sometimes when I am stressed out I put on Mambo No.5 and listen to it while swiping left on every girl on Tinder.
I'm having an affair with person at work and she's pregnant. It's like a 95 percent chance it's my baby but she's married and we agreed to let her raise it as their son. It's hitting me hard and don't know what to do.
I was last minute on myfinal dissertation. With a hex editor I swapped a few bytes in the doc file. It looked corrupted but with enough text to look legit. I submitted at the last second. Looked like it had corrupted at upload & this bought a couple of days so I could finish.
"Recently divorced from a sexless loveless marriage. If I'm glammed up in the car and I stop at lights or roundabouts I flirt with any guys in the car next to me, any age, any type, don't care who's in the car with him. Boosts my ego when I get a smile from them."
I left my wedding ring in a infrequently visited geocache with a note wishing the finder a happier marriage than I had.
At the motorway services I always use the lower children's urinals so I feel over 6ft tall when I look down.
You know on the Super Noodles instructions where it says break the noodle block into 3 or 4 pieces? Well I never bother cos I'm fucking nuts.
"Worked 20 years for local Council and they made me redundant after lying about promotion. On my last day I took a branded Hi-Viz & clip board, printed off some housing schematics and walked round a local beauty spot doing a 'consultation' for a new development I'd made up."
"James, It was me who ordered a doner kebab, chips and a 2ltr bottle of Irn Bru to be delivered to your house at 6:30pm - 15 years ago. FROM 18 DIFFERENT TAKEAWAYS! We sat in a Renault Clio across the road pissing ourselves laughing."
"I wiped bogies on the toilet wall at the police station where I worked for over 10 years until the Sgt threatened to get them DNA tested as it had been going on so long, with so many complaints."

"At 20, my band recorded songs for a demo at a local studio. The technician contacted me days later to say he'd shown it to a record label and they were keen to sign us but we would have to get a new singer to be taken seriously. I declined. 15 years on. I regret it."
"Anytime I see a charity worker walk up my drive and ring my door bell, I quickly put my wireless earphones on and answer the door pretending to be on a zoom meeting. They quickly lose interest and leave."
"At my 1st cub camp I had to share a tent with a bully scout. in the middle of the night when i was too scared to go to the bogs for a piss, i unzipped the tent and peed out. In the morning the bully put his boots on, and complained that it had rained as they were soaked inside."
"I love sending bogus enquiries to local companies, via their website contact forms, on behalf of my racist, sexist, bigoted former boss. I'll never know what comes of it but the satisfaction is great. Gets me through a Friday afternoon."
I'm straight and happily married but the idea of women with Freddie Mercury-type moustaches REALLY turns me on. When I was a teenager I'd draw them on in magazines. I've been plucking up the courage for YEARS to ask my wife to wear a false one in bed but worry about her reaction.
"I'm a homeopath. It's all complete bullshit. All of science would have to be wildly wrong for this bollocks to work. But if people want to pay me to listen to their vague, wishy-washy non-symptoms, go aww diddums and give them a bag of sugar pills, who am I to argue?"
Being a modern man I got into dating apps. Always starts with flirting & then sexting. The girls were always really impressed with my goods & always comment on the size. When we finally get to meet in person they see my tiny child like hands. Then the realisation kicks in.
"My work uses customer satisfaction surveys as a measure of success. Unfortunately the only customers that fill them in are those that complain, so it skews the results down. Unless I spend an afternoon on my laptop with a vpn each period filling out glowing reviews. Which I do."
"Packed festival gear into car, drove to work, told everyone I felt ill, rushed to the loo a few times, so I could bunk off early to go to the festival. Overdid the am dram tho, my boss insisted he got me a taxi home. Went back later and the carpark was locked for the weekend."
"I can tell the difference between the smell of everyone in my household's shit, so I always know who's been in the loo. My wife's is the worst. By far."
"Running an off-road marathon, I got the 15sec until you shit yourself feeling suddenly. Ran into a copse of trees and found a rabbit hole to shit in. Rejoined the race. When finished I heard several runners had got lost after they followed a competitor who then disappeared."
"I was about 8 years old I found my mother's very 70s looking cream vibrator in the divan drawer. I had no idea what it was but I turned it on & popped it in my mouth and rattled it against my teeth. My mother caught me, and I asked what is it? She said it was one of dad's tricks."
"My 20 year old self came home pissed one Friday night. It was summer and still really warm at 2am. I remember looking at the stone kitchen tiles, thinking how cool they looked. My Dad woke me up at 7am. "
"He'd found me snoozing on the kitchen floor, wearing just my knickers...."
"At Christmas I told the kids we would put one item aside to donate to the food bank, rather than have chocolate advent calendars. I forgot to donate the items and ended up just eating our way through them."
At uni we were poor students. Bogroll often ran out. We resorted to getting a stack of Argos catalogues to wipe our arses on. Ended up blocking the drains in the street. A month's worth of backed up shit came flowing out into the street when drain cover got lifted. Fucking stank.
My biggest achievement during lockdown was being told by spotify I'm in the top 4% of Taylor Swift fans. I'm a 42 year old man and have grown up children.
"I was 14 at school I was bullied by a class mate into giving him jelly beans every time I annoyed him, so I got my mum to get me a pack every time almost weekly which led her to believe I love them. Every Christmas / birthday I get a pack from her. I actually despise them."

"When I was a schoolboy, during science lessons, me and a friend would pour the chemicals down the sink and refill the bottles with water. It used to make us chuckle when thinking how many future experiments we'd ruined."
I met my partner when we were both blind drunk and saved her name as a string of ???? Managed to bluff through three dates without knowing. On the fourth I had to rummage in her handbag when she went to the toilet to check her driving licence. Been together 14 years now.
"On the daily school run, I see a dad who reminds me of an acquaintance of a close friend of mine who died too early. I know it's not him and he doesn't know me, but saying 'Hello' to him everyday makes me feel my friend is still alive and friends with us both."
I extol the virtues of using your local bike shop on cycling forums but don't do so myself. Bloke's a cunt and online is way cheaper.
I made a lovely Pork Belly Roast recently. Whilst carving and dishing up the meat I sampled the Crackling. It was perfect. I got carried away and ate all of it. I told the wife there wasn't any Crackling because I cooked it wrong.
"I sing feed the doo-ogs, let them know it's breakfast time to the tune of Band Aid in my head every morning when feeding my canines. If they don't appear I sing do they know it's breakfast time at all."
"Was sat in the barbers chair when I felt a sneeze coming on. I stopped the barber, covered my mouth and sneezed into a small tissue. Unfortunately I must have left a gap. The barber had some of it firmly attached in his beard. I tipped him that day and never returned"
"I play The Great Escape when waiting for trains. Anyone in a high-vis jacket is a Nazi and must be kept 20+ feet away, anyone in the same colour top as you is a fellow escapee and you must nod at them knowingly as if to say goodbye. Bonus points for buying your ticket in German."
"My OH over the years has lied and cheated with GILF and Trans sex workers but doesn't realise I know. I decided to collect all evidence, screenshots of phone/laptop, calls, emails, accounts, addresses, who, how much and for what."
I'm going to annihilate him when I leave.
"While rummaging around on the internet for my biology lecturer's old course notes, I found his personal porn website, full of graphic images of him and his husband doing some pretty extreme banging, including bondage and pissing. So awkward, could never look him in the eye again."
"Prospecting in an ultra remote location in Australia, I found a large rock overhang underneath which was remarkable ancient aboriginal paintings. No one but me knows it exists."
I was in my twenties when I realised an air guitar wasn't an instrument. I thought it was just another variation alongside electric and acoustic.
Our safe word is 'Margaret Thatcher'.
"About 20yrs ago I was in San Francisco and I wandered into an adult video store. Once inside I realised it only had gay videos, but thought I'd get a booth out of curiosity. The video didn't do much for me, but a guy came in and gave me a blow job, which was also underwhelming."
"Even when I do a big poo, I only use the small flush button."
"Divorced 5 years ago. Assets split equally. Similar salaries. Split childcare 50:50. Seen the floorplans for the ex's new house today and Jesus Christ, it's small and poky. Delighted that the kids will realise which parent can't manage to budget, and which one has their backs."

"I've booked a male prostitute for when lockdown eases, it's the first plan I have. I'm so horny and turned on by the thought it's unreal. I've told my husband it's a girls-only shopping trip."
My 12 year old son recently started to stream on twitch. After weeks of zero interactions he was ecstatic to announce that he had not only a viewer but a follower also. I've never seen a happier human being. I am that follower. He can never know.
"When the car park is empty I put on the Theme from Shaft on my phone and try and strut to my car. I time it so when I sit down I say 'right on'. I'm nearly 60, short, bald and overweight."
"Never submit passwords through Google Forms. - here's mine, for years I've used hello666 for everything, including my online banking"
I'm a fairly well-known journalist. I live in fear of someone discovering my terrible dissertation in the university library and publicly exposing me for having been a shit writer twenty years ago. It keeps me up at night.
"I'd rather catch a shiny on Pokemon Go, than have sex"
"When I was about 14 and showing off in front of my mates, I did a piss off a railway bridge to the path below. An old lady walked into the stream, got soaked and started crying. I ran away because what else was I going to do? I still feel awful about it 20 years later"
I'm a professional accountant for UK government. All my reports and presentations have secret messages in usually the first letter of each line. You're a cunt being today's gem.
"I was a skinny, nerdy kid who liked computers and Star Trek. I was, obviously, bullied at school. I now take great pleasure from the fact that one of the worst bullies now cleans my house for min wage"
"I instigated a conversation with my mum about her favourite music, not that I'm interested, but need ideas for her funeral."
As a police officer in the 80s I was commended by the Chief Constable for dramatically reducing rough sleepers by engagement. Reality was my team collected a couple up every night and drove them to a distant borough. Some returned but they then got taken much further away.
My wife hasn't lived in the UK long and when the guy at the till asked if she'd like to donate to the NSPCC she thought he meant the NCP car parks and basically told him to fuck off and now we can't go back there.
I only squeegee the shower door if I think my wife can hear me doing it
I have a really good friend who Ive known for over 30 years but back in the 90s we fell out for a while over a petty disagreement so I pissed in the petrol tank of his old Saab a dozen https://t.co/Hih4rs2rcD broke down and I still haven't confessed to doing it
"If I am on my way to bed, and I go to the toilet for a piss on the way, I often do not bother to put my penis back in my pants afterwards. I am going to get naked anyway, so it would be wasted effort."
"Every now and then, when I remember my trash bag ex ghosted me, I go and find his reddit profile and downvote all of his comments and posts."
When I was a kid I used one of my mums records as a frisbie and it smashed. I was mortified. I hid the evidence and she never noticed. It was a charity single featuring Roland Rat.

"I'm dreading corona restrictions being fully lifted. I told my wife I'd bought us tickets for Hamilton for her birthday last year. I hadn't. But I'm gonna have to fucking buy them now, aren't I?"
"Aghast when my friend told me he only takes a dump when completely naked. As in, fully. Every time. But then I tried it myself. Now I could never, ever go back. Don't knock it."

"Secretly bought the children some fossils to find on a trip to the south coast. 4yr old promptly lost his within 5 minutes. Won't bother in future, they can have a boring time like everyone else."
"I work as a security guard on an industrial estate, imagine the most stereotypical security guard you can & that's me. I spend all night on my phone watching South Park on Netflix, if we ever got robbed I'd genuinely let them take what they want. I don't get paid enough to care."
"I live in a small flat with thin walls. Last night, I did a thunderous fart in the middle of a 3am piss, which synchronised perfectly with a simultaneous flatuential burst from my upstairs neighbour. I feel we're bonded for life now."
I saw my friend Chris put his member inside his Dad's Landrover exhaust pipe. I made a lot of noise so he could hear my approaching so he stopped and I never mentioned it. Never told anyone about it before but feel bad for him
"I have calculated that the rate of toilet paper consumption in our household is approximately 0.65 rolls per person per week, doubled during school holidays or lockdown, and doubled again in Christmas week"
As a teenager I masturbated to completion on a deserted train platform while waiting for the last train home. It was only afterwards that I noticed all the security cameras. It was 1994 but I'm still worried that this footage will resurface and ruin me.
As part of a healthy eating drive we put a box of healthy nibbles in the living room.Or we did - I've discovered it's the perfect place to hide my stash of premium chocolate. Nobody else opens it.
"The pandemic has had a fantastic impact on my life. 4 hour commutes are now office-in-the-bedroom commutes and I now have time for exercise, cooking and unlimited online shopping. I don't want to go back."
I know where my teenager daughter keeps her fags. When my kids are at school I smoke her ciggies in the garden. I consider it payment for all the lifts I give her.
The care agency looking after my old Dad has an online log that relatives can view to see how their loved one is doing. I stopped looking after a month or so - there's only so much I want to know about my father's bowel movements.
"Since newly becoming a parent, the level at which I deem a cup of tea to be at an acceptable drinking temperature has plummeted."
When my son was born he was gifted a blue bunny comforter that for now we'll call Keith. Keith got lost on a walk a few months later. We lied and replaced him like for like and four years later we still live our lives with this impostor and the associated guilt.
The drunken version of myself must really like the sober version judging by the presents he sends from Amazon and EBay that arrive on Monday and Tuesday
"My wife bans me from using 'her' tweezers to pull my stray hairs out. So she's bought expensive new ones for 'her use only'. I've found where she keeps them this morning - they're great, much better than the old ones allocated to me"
There are literally hundreds of critical documents in my companies archive with covert penises hidden in my signature.

I keep myself fat so that I won't be tempted to cheat on my husband.
"Pre-covid when you could test drive cars, out of boredom I used to go to car showrooms, choose the car that would be most difficult to get off the forecourt and then take it for a test drive. When we returned back to the show room I would then say I didn't want the car."
I have won £20k on the lottery but nothing has ever beaten the feeling of opening a bag of bacon crisps and finding a solid lump of flavour.
I force my sister to collect thimbles by purchasing them wherever I come across them. She has never shown any interest in them or desire to own them. She has around 100 now. Her reaction is always hilarious.
I once worked as a cleaner at a bank. The people who worked there were filthy. Dirty dishes piled high in staff room and notes left telling me it's my job to clean them. So I did.. with a dirty mop head.
"Moved into my house in 1996. It's old, doesn't have an electricity meter and I have never had an electricity bill. Never told the leccy people."
I was tugging over fit Chloe from Home & Away on freeze frame but the dog ran into the room just as I was cumming and knocked the remote. The VHS unpaused and I shot my load to an image of Alf.
I got injured playing footy a couple of weeks ago but I didn't tell my girlfriend because I'm enjoying the time to myself. I already spend a disproportionate amount of my free time with her so I'm not prepared to give this time apart up.
"I got too fat for the trousers of my tux, so I rented the next size up for a few bucks and gave them back my pair. They didn't check. I kept getting fatter but because I now had a pair from the rental place, I could pull the same trick more easily. I did it twice more."
I'm dreading the return to hugging. I've enjoyed the space and dignity of not having to hug my mother. I'm not looking forward to the awkwardness again.
"I avoid zebra crossings as I feel guilty as a middle aged man inconveniencing cars, so instead I keep walking until there's a gap in the traffic."
This morning I offered my 11 year old son some of my oat barista milk in his tea by saying would you like some of daddy's special milk?. I've never been so embarrassed.
"I once attended church whilst coming down from an amazing acid trip. I thought maybe I'd experience God in real, in person, but all I experienced was weird looks, boredom and increasing fatigue."
"I married in a hurry because I was rapidly deteriorating with a degenerative condition. Then Vertex came up with a miracle cure and I'm facing a normal lifespan with a wife I don't especially like and don't have anything in common with. Damn you, big pharma."
"I'm a surveyor. A Northern police force tendered to have new police stations built. The commercial builder appointed built the stations half a metre to a metre smaller all the way round than was submitted on the plans. That way they netted at least £300,000 extra profit on each."
"My dad would buy Jeffrey Archer books from the charity shop, so as a surprise I added a final line to one of them, ...and Jeffrey realised he was a cunt. I waited a year for his reaction only to discover he hadn't finished that one and had took it back to the charity shop."
"When I worked in a doughnut factory and was bored, I used to put double jam in some doughnuts and zero in others. In case you'd wondered why there was no jam in your doughnut."

I once accidentally installed Grindr remotely on my son's phone when I was away on a work trip. Had to use the emergency 'wipe phone' option so when he woke up the phone had reset to factory settings.
"I used to bet on football, especially during televised matches, and occasionally people will ask me why I don't do it anymore. I say it's because I just lost interest, but in reality it's because I lost over £50k in online casinos and had to extend my mortgage to cover the debt."
I love my other half and if she left me I'd be crushed. But I also regularly miss the excitement of meeting somebody new and being in a new relationship. Is that normal?
"We live in a remote cottage in Scotland. Whenever a vehicle comes down the drive, I narrow my eyes and imagine turning to my wife and saying: Take the children inside because my gangland enemies have found us and are coming to take their revenge. It's usually just the postman."
The only reason I am still with my partner is because of our dogs. I love them more than life itself and couldn't bear to be without them.
For months after we split I had an old phone of my ex wife's that was still logged into Google. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the man she'd been cheating on me with had a smaller penis than me thanks to being able to see her camera roll still.
I went home with a guy after a night out & we were about to get started & I remembered I had a tampon in. For reasons I still don't understand I took it out & put it under his bed instead of going to the bathroom. Disgusted with myself & that I'll be remembered as that girl.
Every time I see an old phone number on TV like from a football match from the 70's I call it in the vain hope it will connect to the past like some sort of time machine. Hasn't happened yet...
Rang an 0898 sex line in the 90s when I was in my early teens. When we got the BT bill my dad hit the roof and disputed it. I denied ringing despite BT saying it defintely came from our house. They paid us back in the end. It was a great wank.
"When I'm eating Tic Tacs, I like to tip them directly into my mouth from the box and pretend I'm an edgy, washed up detective with a dark past and a painkiller addiction."
"I don't use the individual textiles setting on the steam iron. I set it up to the highest temperature, hope nothing burns and just wing it."
I made my wife one of those clone a willy vibrators. I'd always thought I was average or less but was chuffed when I saw they only supply enough silicone for less than half of my junk. I'm not sure how to use my new found big dick energy.
I've ordered so many takeaways over lockdown that when the delivery driver arrives and I collect the order I shout back to my housemate that their food has arrived & roll my eyes. I don't have a housemate.
I once worked in a shop and we had a customer who would return something everytime she came in. This meant she had to sign her name but it didn't look quite like her actual name. Because of her signature she became known as Mrs Dildo
Ages 13 through 16 I was bullied for supposedly having a small dick. Caused me to be very insecure and awkward. At uni I made friends and bloomed so started dating. Found out that apparently I'm hung like a horse from every girl I've been with since. Fuck all you bullies
"I'm 41, and nothing gives me more joy than going through Facebook to see how bald my old schoolmates are while I still have a thick head of long hair, especially those who used to take the piss out of it at school."

I've been tasked with searching my deceased father-in-law's computer for any important documents or photos worth keeping. All I've found of note is a lot of awful poetry declaring his love to a woman not his wife.
"The Cock Inn, Peasmarsh. East Sussex. Early 80's. We found an abandoned car in the rough behind the caravans. Smashed it up a bit more. "
Apparently it was the owners classic car 'do up' project.
Sorry about that...
"A kid at school came in with dressings on each side of his neck. I asked if it was the first stage of his Frankenstein surgery, he'd been in a car accident and his grandmother was killed and his dad in intensive care. I still loathe myself to this day."
"Found out my ex had been exchanging nudes with a woman who knew we were together and knowingly acted like butter would melt around me. I broke up with my ex and a couple of years later when she began dating someone, I exchanged nudes with him. I love the long game."
"I had my first wank while I was a patient in traction in a children's ward aged 10, and all the nurses on duty ran out because the boy in the bed next door started shouting that I was having a fit as the weights at the end of my bed were clanging as my legs juddered."
Since working from home I purposely schedule work calls whilst doing the school run so I don't have to engage with the other parents in school yard
My wife is so jealous of me even having female co-workers that I've resorted to lying that there are only guys in my department just to save me the headaches and guilt trips that stem from her own irrational paranoia.
"In school, teacher started a game of Chinese Whispers. Me, 4th along the line of 30, changed the sentence completely, knowing the lad at the end was nicknamed Bopper. It got to the end of the class unchanged as he stood in front of the class and said Bopper's got no knob."
"I'll be walking aimlessly down the street, decide to turn around, & rather than just turn the fuck around, I'll go through this pointless rigmarole of either pulling out my phone out & pretending I've just got a text or do my best oh shit I've forgotten something acting. I'm 33"
About a decade ago I got sacked for fraud. I currently work a similar job in a similar industry which is how I know HR departments never really check references properly
"It's taken 30 years to realise the lyrics to Lithium by Nirvana are I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good. and not, my willy's good."
"I once sold my worn knickers to a guy on the internet, but it was really my husband who'd been wearing them"
"My fathers new vile Russian wife was being so awful I reported her to the council for fraudulently owning a council house and lying on her mortgage application forms. She was convicted and deported. Never told my father, he thinks it was the neighbours."
I went to see Sense and Sensibility because I thought it was a sequel to Dumb and Dumber. Took me 20 mins to realise it wasn't a weird intro.
"Every time I get in a bath, as I put my arms under the water I panic I've not taken my watch off. I've not worn a watch for about 15 years, and have never got in a bath wearing one."
"When I was a young boy I couldn't workout how so much wee could come out of my testicles... then one day while watching Doctor Who, the answer was made apparent to me, it was the same principle as the TARDIS: my balls were larger on the inside than they seemed on the outside."

Went to Tesco a bit drunk with my big coat on to pick up a few things and nicked two packs of paracetamol and a bag of beef jerky in my pockets. Paid for the Guinness and chicken. First things I've ever nicked. I'm 35. I feel kind of amazing. Like I caught up with the cool kids.
Just found my dad's Twitter which I didn't know about. It's pictures of me us at the football and all his tweets to trans porn stars. I've tried to keep my picture offline because of what I do and this is the only thing you get if you search my name on Google images. FFS dad.
"I was sent to London as part of my job. I would stay at the Savoy. Of an evening I would stroll along the hotel corridors helping myself to the crockery, cutlery and condiments left outside rooms when they were done with room-service. I've since built up a decent dinner service."
Aged 13 I was locked out of my house so tried to break in by wedging windows open. That night my parents sat me and my sister down to say someone had tried to break into the house so they were arranging for brand new windows and locks costing thousands of pounds. I said nothing.
My favourite unexpected part of trying to go vegan has been discovering the pleasure of rubbing nutritional yeast powder into my gums like some kind of umami cocaine
"I was organising my mates stag do to Vegas and had to sort everyone's visas. For a laugh I decided to tick the box saying that he was part of a terrorist organisation, but completely forgot about it. Border force didn't see the funny side and we are no longer allowed in the US."
"I have a funeral playlist, I listen to it daily as it is a banger. Pretty sure guests won't enjoy transitions from Bach to d&b and reggae, but fuck 'em it is my funeral an I get to set the rhythm."
"Years ago at a house party I was so pissed I dropped a bottle of milk in the kitchen, no one saw. My mate got blamed and was forever nicknamed the milkman. Sorry Dan."
"Out of boredom during lockdown, while having a wank I recorded my ejaculation in slow motion on my phone. The spurt in high def is a thing of beauty I can't stop rewatching it. It's like something from National Geographic"
I once finished with a girl by text because I couldn`t be arsed to drive the half hour there & the half hour back. Didn't matter because she turned up at mine & punched me in the face anyway.
When I was a kid bags by the sports brand Head were really fashionable and they were always called Head bags so of course I used to think they were bags you carried by a strap around your head
"My wife once convinced me that Bob Carolgees canine puppet, Spit the Dog, was in fact real and was not on TV anymore because he had been put to sleep. "
She still takes the mick out of me occasionally about it
"As a taxi driver, when a fare is in the cab, I'll size them up a deliver the patter that I think will score me the biggest tip. Bit right wing, Farage and Bojo or environment and women's rights for lefties. Works every time!"
I'm not saying my family is tight but most of our drinking glasses were formerly either small Nutella jars or candle holders.
"I have always got a slightly sad, depressed feeling after sex. Regretful and wanting to be alone. Doesn't matter who it's been with or how awesome it's felt at the time, the aftermath is just me wishing I was on my own. I assume this isn't normal?"
"Once, as a young-looking 17 year old boy, a guy stopped his car to offer me a lift late at night. I was wary so pretended I was only going down the road and refused. Curious to this day whether he was interested in killing me, having sex with me, or both."

I never particularly wanted children but my wife was desperate to have them. Now I've got two teenagers and I think I was right.
"I've always really liked the idea of rimming, but have never let anyone do it to me for fear of them being uncomplimentary about the state of my sphincter."
"The first time I hooked up with a guy in a hotel he had The X Factor on the TV. That's how I knew Joe McElderry was the answer to the question 'who won the X Factor in 2009?' when we were doing a trivia quiz recently, and not, as I told my wife, because I took a lucky guess."
I had sex with a well known right wing commentator before he was famous. We hooked up on Grindr and the knowledge of what I did still haunts me.
"My mum kept a ring tree on the toilet cistern when I was a kid. Once, I had a huge poo and accidentally swiped the tree while wiping. My great-grandma's ruby ring, a treasure of my mum's, went into the poo and I had to fish it out. She never knew, but I felt bad when she wore it."
I speak Portuguese as a second language. My ex-gf was very into this and begged me to use it in dirty talk. Being non-native I quickly ran out of things to say so shout out to my ex who may be the only person to climax over excerpts from the Portuguese national anthem
"I take phone calls for a major ISP. We're outsourced and the company we work for gets paid per call answered, not per problem solved. We have a running contest to see who can make a customer call in the most number of times to get a simple fix sorted."
"Big butts are nice but they're not everything. Small ones are just as lovely. So are nice legs. And boobs, big and small. Also flat stomachs. And that little belly chub some girls have. Backs, too. Fuck it, girls are just great. God, I'm so lonely."
"I got insanely drunk on red wine and spewed all over our en suite bathroom. My very pregnant and short-sighted wife thought it was cat blood and made me try to find him. Cleaned it up, told her I found another cat dead in our yard. I've never owned up to it. It was 20 years ago."
"I was waiting to deposit a heavy bucket of coins from my milk run at the bank. When it was my turn, I bent to pick it up and the effort caused a jet of diarrhea to squirt into my jeans. No jocks, so it ran onto the carpet. I drove to the next branch 10 km away from that day on."
"Daughter, then 2yo, hugged me when I left for work. 30 minute train commute. Got to office, and, unnoticed, the porridge from her face covered the front of my trousers. My colleagues struggled to believe my story, and still raise it at drinks. My daughter is now 20."
After having a plant in my house for 15ish years I thought I might treat it to some plant food. To my surprise it's pink and grey leaves turned green. I thought it was meant to look like that.
"I run a Little Free Library. I always remove any of the 50 Shades books and throw them into the recycling. Anything else can stay, but 50 Shades romanticises abuse and control, I'm not spreading bullshit with my library."
"My 8 year old saw walked in on me and the missus having sex, when he asked what we were doing I just gave him 2 Easter eggs, a bag of haribo and put the justice league on because knew he wouldn't talk for 4 hours."
"The neighbour under me was illegally subletting her flat to obnoxious loud upperclass twats for about four times what she was paying. She is a soap opera actress so I made her 15 years older on a fan site, and referenced it on Wikipedia. The edit wars went on for months."
I'm always really jealous whenever I see a married couple passionately share common interests like computer games or sport or whatever. I have fuck all in common with my wife other than being miserable
"The bloke we sold our house to was a right arse, threatened to pull out at the last minute and dropped the price. We had to go along with it to get the house we were buying. So we took the back panel off the shed, and put a small hole in the toilet wall before moving out."

"My wife showed a slight interest in ornithology during lockdown, so I bought her a top of the range pair of binoculars. She has only ever used them to spy on the neighbours."
"I used to work in a large clothing store in town and always got put in the basement stockroom in the mornings to unload deliveries. One morning I came in exhausted and absolutely hanging, so I assembled all the bubble wrap and packaging into a comfy bed and slept until lunch."
"I once wet myself at a work doo in a pub. I was so drunk that I thought that the only solution was to undress, soak my jeans and put them back on, so that the wet stain was no longer visible. I walked around with drenched trousers for the rest of the night! I think nobody noticed"
I live alone but during lockdown purchased a large Cookie Monster puppet. We watch TV together and have long conversations. Mainly about cookies. I do the voice and everything.
"As a kid, I thought that when music played on the radio, that the actual band came into the studio and played. After the song, while the DJ was speaking, the band was quietly ushered out, and the next band came in to set up ready for the next song."
"My landlord illegally evicted me from the house I was renting. Couldn't afford to sue him, but before I left the house, I planted a load of Japanese Knot Weed in the garden. That'll teach the bastard."
"My mum is dying of terminal cancer. My siblings are doing a great job of supporting her - visiting, calling and FaceTiming constantly. There are days where I can't bring myself to even text her and I hate myself for it."
Recently started delivering for a world wide company. Hoping one day a woman will invite me in for sex whilst I deliver her parcel. Think I watch too much porn.
"When I worked in a mortgage and loans department of a bank back in the early 90's, I used to advise clients how to avoid having to pay the bank's hefty early redemption penalty fees. No idea how much I cost the bank, but it went under during the credit crunch."
My friends at work think I'm strange because when I have a kiwi fruit at lunch I always eat the skin and the flesh. The truth is I love the feeling of hairy skin on the back of my throat.
"A few years ago I had a great physique, with a rippling six pack. Today i used my beer belly to rest my 2 year old on at swimming. Dad bod complete."
I tut along with everyone else about how awful Wetherspoons are but I sometimes go and have a plated breakfast there and throughly enjoy it.
Sometimes; in the safety of a cubicle; I'll drop both my trousers and pants round my ankles for a standing big boy wee.
"I stayed in a villa for 1 night with my new gf & her family. We were in Spain for a wedding. My gf & I came back paralytic & went to bed. I got up to puke in the bathroom, came back to bed, spooned my gf & fell asleep. Woke up a few hrs later to find I was in bed with her uncle."
I've given my brother my NOW TV log in details. I can see what he's been watching and if he's half way though a film/episode I sometimes fast forward the film 20 minutes or so or if he's watching a box set I'll skip a couple of episodes.
"When the worktops in the kitchen are too dirty and I can't be bothered to wipe them down, I simply lift the dog onto the worktop and let her lick them clean."
I have a secret biscuit stash in my WFH office and I'm absolutely terrified my wife will find them and make me put them all in the bin.

"Since installing a wood burner I can't pass any branches I see within a kilometre of home without picking them up & taking them back to the wood store. I don't see them as branches - I see them as 5p, 10p, 20p pieces etc. just lying on the pavement. Free money!"
Since that hairdresser was on here I've started to wash my ears every day and twice a week I exfoliate them. Wanted to tell the barber but thought he might have thought I seemed odd.
"I regularly fantasise about Sophia from the puppet family Dolmio ads and if she was real. She's my dream woman. Long flowing dark hair, huge gorgeous eyes, killer figure, that accent, what more could you want?"
"My 6 year old has whooped me at Uno today. When he's lauding it and taking the piss, I take comfort in the fact I could have kicked his little ass but decided to be the bigger person."
"Wife does all the wallpapering in our house. Thinks she's a legend at it. Truth is, she's appalling. Mismatched patterns everywhere, and cuts that a blind man could do better. I don't criticise though, cos then I'd have to do it."
A female coworker once told me that if we were both single she would absolutely ruin me and I've never been more turned-on in my life
As a fresh faced teenager from the North East I got really annoyed with the other bar staff in Manchester Poly Students Union who forgot to put the red wine in the ice bucket with the white wine. Wasn't until years later I was made aware it wasn't meant to have been there.
"At my brother's wedding I had an asthma attack, they had to call an ambulance and it ruined the mood for their first dance. I got a lot of sympathy but in truth, it was my fault from huffing helium balloons in the bogs trying to get a squeaky voice"
"When I zoom in on a photo on my laptop, in the second it takes to de-pixelate I say, 'Enhance', so that I feel like a CIA photo-analyst who is about to make a big break through in the case."
I'm hoping that virtual reality will have progressed sufficiently in the next 20 years that I can enjoy my retirement living another life that is not limited by old age. Otherwise it really does seem shit getting old
"I'm a 35 year old man and every single time I have a muffin, I'll eat the paper wrapping. It's honestly the best part of the experience to me and holds the most flavour"
I'm a straight man and I regularly fake orgasms. It's easy to do and nobody has ever commented. I don't need to cum to have a good time and sometimes the good time goes on too long.
Despite having no real qualifications I have managed to find myself in a senior management role in government. I don't really understand anything that's going on. In spite of this I am well thought of as a safe pair of hands - I'm terrified that I'll be promoted further.
"Whenever I follow a recipe that calls for olive oil, I don't use olive oil."
"Aged about 6 I told my friend who was over my house, the pills in my parent's bedroom were sweets. He was pretty sceptical but I without any proof I convinced him. They tasted awful and we were both ill the next day, but on the flip side we didn't get pregnant."
"I worked as a technician on Eldorado and one night when drunk did a big shit on the set. Next day the one in the wheelchair rode through it. Sorry also to Marcus Tandy for it getting in your shoes. Hoping the episodes will turn up online, the turd was visible in 3 episodes."
"As a man, I like to let my fingernails grow out about a week longer than they should so that I get better purchase when picking my nose"

"I was in a nostalgic 1980s Football Facebook. I got removed because, whenever a picture of a player from the 80s was posted, I'd comment Sadly missed, RIP or It's really sad what happened to him. Somebody complained, but I was just adding a little fun in these dark times."
"When I buy something from Amazon, I click this is a gift and write myself a gift note - they're free - so I pretend it's a present. Most recently I bought batteries and told myself You are utterly sensational"
I've shagged my mother-in-law. It was not the amazing experience porn websites make it out to be.
"I tell people my favourite film is The Shining, but it's actually Dumb and Dumber."
My brother is a nice guy but he's become completely obsessed with Q Anon and anti vax stuff. I honestly can't spend any time in his company anymore. But you can't break up with a brother so what can I do?
"Even though my 3 kids are waay to old for children's books, I still buy every new Julia Donaldson book just for me. The make me grin and some of the wordplay is inspired."
"When I was single I really fancied a girl at work, but she was in a relationship. I then met a girl in a pub who looked a lot like her and a few years later we were married. Can't ever tell my wife I first spoke to her because she looked like someone else."
"When my wife makes food I don't like, I eat it quickly so the taste does not linger. She interprets this as a liking for it so makes more. I am not allowed to cook since the Xmas lunch disaster of 2010."
My kid's trampoline was too big and annoyed me. Over the winter I sprayed all the springs with salty water and they rusted solid. I pointed this out as unsafe and cut up the frame immediately with an angle grinder.
"Classic situation with neighbour knowing my name and me not having a clue his, rather than be an adult about it I've paid £3 for a copy of the land registry title plan just to get his name, cheers Martin."
"Soon after we got married I made the wife change her regular lottery numbers as I thought they were too close to mine. A few weeks later her numbers came up. I lay awake at night thinking about it. I never told her, she thinks I'm troubled by some deep childhood trauma."
"2 years ago I was picking a last song to kill myself to, but I accidentally clicked on You Spin Me Right Round in my recently played. It made me realise the stupidity of it all. I've started getting help, but never told anyone that Pete Burns saved my life."
"My wife tells me how much she appreciates that I wear my wedding ring, even after all these years. I haven't told her this is my third one, I lost both the others. Thank god I kept the original receipt"
"I'm a now retired senior television technician. At teatime Saturday 26 November, 1977, aliens from the Ashtar Galactic Command took control of audio of the TV broadcast in Hampshire. Sorry ufologists, but that was actually me and some mates pissing about. We never got caught."
"I was queueing with my mate for school lunch although I'd spent all my money on sweets and was skint. He dropped his £1 coin, which rolled under a vending machine. After a lengthy full-scale search it was nowhere to be seen. I think I had pie and chips that day. Sorry dude."
When I have a day off and the wife leaves me with a list of jobs. I leave them all day and use the find my phone function we have for our devices to track when she's heading home so I can get them all done quickly before she's back.

Night out on the lash and crashed at my mates pad. Was having a dream that Nicole Kidman was licking my balls and gigglestick when I surfaced from sleep. Sun streaming through the window I was a tad sweaty. I looked down to find my mates red setter lapping at my salty lunchbox.
"I moved into a new flat 2 days before the impending lockdown, they told me it was a vegetarian kitchen. I panicked and said i was. For the last 12 months I've been smashing meat on the sly and chewing gum to cover the potential smell like a teenager would with cigarette smoke."
When I was a child I used to look under the doormats for beetles. My Mum found half beetle carcasses laying around regularly. I can't remember which half of the beetles I ate
"Next Friday will be my last day at work, I was made redundant by a new cost cutting CEO. I have set up my email to send a spreadsheet with everyone's salary and bonus numbers for the past five years to every person in the company."
"Whenever I'm decorating and mixing filler, I always spit into the mix. I like to think that the house will contain my DNA long after I'm gone."
Because of Covid I now hold my breath when I walk past people.
"Sometimes when I'm walking toward the toilet to unleash a massive turd I point at the toilet and say you, me, now"
My girlfriend is in the process of planning us a staycation. I'm not sure how to tell her I've spent my annual leave watching snooker from my desk.
My daughter watches all these YouTube channels where American families buy obscene amounts of toys. I find them horrible to watch so I secretly block them from her account when she puts her iPad down.
We were poor when I was young and to avoid buying expensive crumpets my mum would tell me they were out of season. I was embarrassingly old before I realised it was bollocks.
My wife thinks I'm in therapy for my childhood trauma but it's actually for my terrible secret gambling addiction which has been ruining my life. I've quit and feel like I've been given a second chance. Feel like I've won.
The couple in the flat above mine fuck every morning and afternoon noisily and without fail. That's been the hardest thing to cope in lockdown with as a single 20s female with a high sex drive.
"Swapped numbers with an old pal on a drunken night out so that he could invite me to 5 a side football. He must of been drunk as he put my name in his phone wrong and thought I was one of the girls hed pulled that night, I led him on for weeks, even got a dick pic"
"Always wondered if it was true about putting boiling water on frozen glass, turns out it is! Went out to deuce my gf's car poured a full kettle on and watched it crack all the way top to bottom, went in and told her it was like this when I went out to it, still no clue it was me"
"Years ago I locked myself out of my flat. My flatmate climbed up to the bathroom window on the second floor, smashing it as he climbed in. He cut himself so badly that he needed several stitches. As he screamed in agony I realised my keys were in my coat pocket. I never told him."
"Whenever I go to use a urinal whilst wearing shorts, my legs give me a reminder of how much urine must be embedded in my trousers most of the time"
After a particularly drunken night when I was 19 I threw up in next doors goldfish pond. Saw the neighbour next morning picking chow mein and dead fish out of the pond. Still feel sorry about the fish 30 years later.

"As a kid I used to flush my pants down the toilet which blocked drains but mum blamed the neighbours, accusing them of sticking nappies down their toilet. 30 yrs later & the yard still floods during heavy rain. Mums raked in £10k+ in compo cos water company hasn't sorted it yet"
"Lived in a house with one toilet, really needed to take a dump but the bathroom was in use. So took the lid off the bin in the kitchen, took a massive dump in to the half full bin, wiped arse with kitchen roll, tied up bin liner and took it straight outside."
"After I left as the accounts administrator for a law firm, I grassed up my ex-boss because he was laundering money. It led to an investigation that dragged several other law firms down too, with many of them getting jail time. Not at all sorry, you greedy immoral cunts."
I live in a big house that's had hundreds of tenants over the years. Sometimes for a treat I open a piece of mail from the massive pile of random uncollected letters we have piled up. Today I got a free teabag from a circular! Thanks former tenants!
I am circumcised for medical reasons and always joked with a mate that I am Jewish. He is a primary teacher and has now invited me to give a talk to his class on Judaism and I can't back out
"In 3rd year English I was struggling to come up with something for a creative writing assignment. Having just watched Predator 2 the previous week I basically transcribed the opening action scene with the drug gangs into my story. Got great marks, sorry Mr Campbell."
I dumped my then girlfriend the week Freddie Mercury died. She was a massive Queen fan and I wasn't getting much attention. Still wonder how it might have turned out. She was a lovely girl.
"When lockdown began I was home alone a lot. My wife is a nurse. Guess it was the boredom but I started to piss about applying some of her make-up & trying on some of her clothes. It's now turned into a full-blown drag act with my very own alter-ego, 'Rosie, The Queen of Corona'."
"As a teacher I love to look through local court results and spot names of former pupils who have been convicted. So far in 20 years I've taught: 2 murderers, a rapist, multiple drink drivers and someone who pissed on a police officers foot."
I fall asleep the moment the tv goes on but suddenly wake up mid programme. I'll then make some loud proclamation about it as though I've been watching all along. I don't know why. My missus knows I've been asleep and snoring. I'm a twat.
I once wore my black socks over my white trainers to get into a nightclub with a shoes only policy.
Ate a bag of dinosaur sweets and it had pterodactyl-shaped ones in it. Sent a complaint to the company as a joke and they sent me an apology and a £10 voucher.
An ex-girlfriend fantasized about being a rampaging giant with the ability to grow. Smashing. Crushing. Eating people. Destroying. With every body part thinkable. Even farting entire cities off the map while having sex. I still have nightmares about her 7 years on.
"In my early teens, i thought that when you forgot something, the piece of brain that held the memory died and came out your nose as snot. I told this to a friend at the time, he went on to be a professor. I think our friendship probably drifted apart around that time."
"My husband uses voice dictation for all his texts. This was knob-worthy before lockdown, but we live in a one bed flat so are in the same room all the time now. It's often hard to tell if he's talking to me or the phone, except when he whisper dictates private texts. Wanker."
My young son once opened my car door and badly scratched the car next to us. I got back in and changed my parking space. Still feel guilty ten years later.

My cheating husband thinks we are still married. I divorced him 2yrs ago when he signed the p/work. He never ever reads his mail so doesn't know. He's begging for a divorce. I've enjoyed refusing.
I've taken a real dislike to a boy at my daughters nursery. He's sickly and pale and has a stupid mooney face like a child in a Victorian workhouse. I can't stand the sight of him. I'm 39 and an accountant.
"Dubai airport toilets. Long queue. Everyone ignored one stall. Flight called. I jumped the queue and went into the stall. There was nothing but a hole in the middle of the floor. Wow, primitive, I thought. Crimped off a length into the hole, and then noticed the shower head."
"I got made redundant during lockdown by a company with zero ethics, but because I put on a smile, they didn't delete my creds as soon as they told me. I left them two gifts: turning off the backups, and a cron job to drop their databases a month later. They were down for weeks."
"When we were younger me and my sister taped over my mind cassette of George Bensons greatest hits with farting sounds, still feel guilty about it as my mum loved that tape."
A notorious bully in our workplace suffered the embarrassment of having a doppelgänger on the front of the local paper for committing a serious crime. I gave their name to the police and they were under investigation for 3 months.
"I used to think Terry & June was a sack of shite. Now, having reached their approximate age, I realise that I'd love to have a home life half as interesting"
"I cheated on my degree. I hadn't finished my final dissertation in time so just handed it in, ending abrubtly. Finished it 2 days later and told my tutor that I'd ran out of printer tokens mid print and had just realised the end was missing. She accepted it without question."
"When I was about 10 I told my dad and grandad a joke I'd heard, but not understood, about what a prostitute and a Cadbury's creme egg have in common. They're both dead now but the shame lives on."
"Been staying a lot in hospital recently. The nurses uniforms are red, blue and white so I've imagined I'm in sickbay on a starship and the various colours are different classes. These Federation officers keep me alive as I am an alien envoy on the way to sign a peace treaty."
On an industrial placement as a postgrad I was invited out to lunch by the bosses on the first day. One of the bosses was Greek. I thought it would impress him to tell him the only Greek phrase I knew. Translates as give me a blowjob. Mortified by the reaction.
I always imagine my cat saying alright cunts? like a London wide boy whenever he struts into the room.
"I cry when I see a dead animal at the side of the road. The little dead, sinewy, beautiful, furry thing, looking for food for its family, was cruelly wiped out by a twat speeding in a shit car, probably with his tie over his shoulder. listening to Lighthouse Family."
"When I take my socks off, I collect all the sock fluff and eat it."
"I am mostly not interested or don't understand messages people send me, so I reply with a heart emoji 95% of the time. People seem satisfied."
"Was taking a dump early 90's in the bushes along the tow path at Old Ford Lock. Famous of course for C4s Big Breakfast. Mid curl, I heard Chris and Gaby's voices nearby and bright lights. They were filming a live segment, literally 10ft from me crouched down pants round ankles."
I enjoy playing a game on my phone where you have to save little animals that tend to jump off cliffs.
I like to think that everything I do in the game is playing out in an alternate universe and they see me like some kind of god that helps them make it home alive.

"Was out jogging one night when I passed a gang of 13/14 yr old girls loitering outside a newsagent. One of them shouted out Oi, baldy, you run like a girl. I ran off scared shitless. I honestly thought I might get a kicking if I retaliated. I'm 45. The fucking humiliation."
I used to wear tan driving gloves in my car for no other reason that Han Solo sometimes wore tan gloves while servicing the Millennium Falcon. I drove a 1.1ltr Clio.
"Aged 13, I fell asleep masterbating to my hidden page 3 stash, resulting in me falling asleep cock in hand. When I woke up I was dressed and tucked into bed by my mum, with the newspapers neatly folded on my desk. We never spoke about this, ever."
Years ago I was moaning about being single to my sis and she asked which of her mates I fancied - I said 'Cath' and she rang her to arrange a date. We've been together for 15 years now. The 'Cath' my sis rang wasn't the one I meant.
"I lost my mum recently. I miss her terribly, but the 2 weeks after her passing I could drink like I was a student again without any condescending comments from my partner. I loved it. I treated it like the last gift from my mum."
"I do 'tarot readings'. I have no idea what the cards mean, I just make it up and say what I think the person wants to hear. No complaints."
"As a teenager I was embarrassingly obsessed with my uncle's accomplished, artsy friends. It's only due to facebook that I've been able to see what wankers they all are. Thanks Zuckerburg!"
"Whilst working in an old peoples home in my teens, i often hid biscuits on rails, picture frames, pots etc. You'd see their little smile when they found one whilst wandering. I stopped when one of the senile residents got the blame."
I'm a 43 year old dad with a 6 stack CD player in my car. CD 1-5 is my kids music. CD 6 is for when I'm alone so I can sing at the top of my voice. Alanis Morissette - Jagged Little Pill. Same CD for almost 20 years.
"I have a vague childhood memory of my dad taking me to what I guess was his dealer's place and me spilling red juice all over the cream carpet. Must have been a nightmare situation, sorry to everyone involved."
"Since me and the wife have been working from home I thought I'd playfully book in an afternoon meeting in the bedroom ;-). Days later i learned how to set my work Outlook calendar to private. A few days too late, mind."
I'm a 50 year old professional woman. I still walk along the pavement avoiding the cracks
I won 2.4m on the lottery mid 2020. I told friends and family my new house and car came from investing in Amazon in 2006. They think I'm a genius and it deters scrounging.
I once took a crap in Duncan's waffle maker. The stench was revolting but the waffle actually looked edible
Sometimes I fake my toddler's scribbles in family birthday cards because I can't be bothered to get her to do it.
In the '70s I poured washing up liquid into a fountain in Bolton. The parents of a toddler laughed as their offspring was transformed into a bubble-boy as the wind blew the bubbles towards BHS & the manager of Saxone shoe shop got a Santa beard courtesy of my antics. Sorry!
I'm a straight man. When lying in bed I sometimes I like to tuck the duvet under my armpits and pretend it's a huge wedding dress.

My baby is just learning about switches and buttons. Whenever she touches my wife's boobs I turn the light on and off so that she thinks nipples are light switches.
"This morning while walking the dog, I suddenly needed to shit so squatted down behind a hedge. My dog crouched down next to me at the same time and had his poo. We are turd buddies now and I feel really bonded with him."
I love growing plants in my greenhouse. My wife's very impressed with some shrubs I've grown from seed. I suppose I should tell her they're high quality bush and I intend to spend the rest of the year off my tits. I'm a senior partner in a law firm and I'm 63.
I've been asked to be an usher at 3 weddings and my heart sinks every time. If you get married please pay the venue to perform the menial usher tasks so your friends can relax and enjoy themselves.

Turned down my little sister's friend because I thought my pals would take the piss going out with someone two years younger than me. Now she's an A-list actress and I work in IT support.
My daughter is at 6th form college doing engineering as an A level. I know her password so regularly access her Google account and correct / improve her submission without her knowledge. An average student who is now getting a B grade in her coursework. So proud!
"In 2012 I was paid for a private IT job £100 in Bitcoin, unlike most twats I always knew it was there and kept it as £100 is a lot to me, just sold them for £340,000 and paid off my house."
"I play video games on the easiest setting bcause I don't want a challenge, I just want to get through the story. I tell my mates I play it on normal difficulty. I'd be mortified if they knew."
When my boss did the ice bucket challenge I might have added some of my own piss
"When I was 8 I threw a brick at a man from the top of an old football stand for no reason. It hit the pillar he was sitting on. Hard. It would have killed him, and the thought keeps me awake at night 25 years on."
My hubby was unfaithful at a stag do. He confessed but was adamant it was nothing major. Someone else from the stag do let slip that he actually shagged a prostitute.
"I've done then honorable thing and get pregnant with him again, extra child maintenance for when I kick him out."
"My best friend and I married early. We have a girls weekend at a spa twice a year where we do no spa, just hook up with randoms and take MDMA."
I am a senior manager and have a really good relationship with my boss. I dont drink at office parties because I know that if I get drunk I'll inevitably end up punching him in the balls as a joke.

"Went to a window lady in Amsterdam. She asked if I wanted extras, obviously, but I only had loose change. Nervous I dropped it all. She helped me pick it up & count it out. Trying to spice up the shit start she took my glasses off to wear as a sexy treat & I couldn't see a thing"
It was my car's second birthday last week. I gave it premium unleaded instead of normal unleaded for the first time ever as a present.
"I know the pandemic killed a lot of people but it also meant we've not had to pay for tube tickets, nursery fees or after school clubs. By the time the office reopens we will have saved at least £25k and with 95% mortgages back we'll be able to afford to buy our first home."
Having a lockdown affair with bloke I don't fancy because my husband hasn't done the washing up once since last March.
"I went to a selective school, but it wasn't until a year ago that I realised roosters didn't have to penetrate the hard shells of eggs with their tiny pin like dicks. They just had to fuck the hens before they laid the eggs… And I'm 48 years old"
"I wiped bogies on the wall side of my bunk bed for 7 years, I was 14 when they moved the bed and it still haunts me to this day, it looked like a Jackson Pollock."
I'm taking photos of all the cars I come across parked on the pavement so that I can report them once/if the fine for it is introduced.
"I once watched a documentary that featured a story about a rat coming up through the soil pipe to bite someone's arse when they were on the toilet. I think about that every time I sit on the pot. Now, so will you"
"I have been training my children to interrupt tedious Zoom meetings with colleagues to allow me to get on with some actual work. They get £1 a go, and will interrupt upon receiving a WhatsApp."
"For a Secondary School English asignment about love poetry, I partially plagarised the lyrics to Spinal Tap's Stonehenge. It went down quite well."
"One of my colleagues suddenly died last year. Since then, I've blamed mistakes I've made at work on him about 10 times or so. No questions have ever been asked and I always get away with it"
"Whenever I go to the toilet at work I take off my suit jacket, hang it up and pretend I'm a high flying drug addicted stock exchange dealer about to shoot up in the cubicle to get me through the day."
Working my notice at a hotel reception 10 years ago I got shouted at by a complaining customer. I was so angry I copied their details and signed them up to all kinds of crap. To this day I use their details whenever I don't want to use my own. I've remembered them off by heart.

Every time I visit a bookshop I look for a copy of Steinbeck's 'Of Mice and Men'. If I find one I surreptitiously write the words 'Lennie dies' on the title page. I've done this hundreds of times over a 30 year period.
"My girlfriend thinks I watch 10 years Younger with her as a thank you for letting me watching the football. Really, I am in love with makeup expert on there. She's beautiful"
"Found my ex-girlfriend and the love of my life on Facebook after 30 years. She's a right religious nutter, COVID denier, and home tuition freak. So glad we split up now."
My wife has taken to making artisan bread from home which never works out as it never rises or is burnt and inedible. I secretly make butties from Warbutons Toastie bread when she's at work and each time I do this I throw away a chunk of hers and tell her it's really nice.
"I've always been nice to everyone at work, but now the IT guy thinks I'm his best friend. I now have to live with my IT problems, or surreptitiously swap broken hardware with a colleague's, instead of making the visit to his office. Sorry, Greg, you're just not my cup of tea."
This past year has been hard and a few weeks ago I went to take my own life but ultimately couldn't go through with it. The next day my wife showed me her call log & my parents had called her twice. They died over 2yrs ago & the number is out of use.
Someone at work called me an elder statesman and dignified in my approach to working with others. I'm only 46 and the reason I stay quiet and make 'considered decisions' is that I'd be swearing my fucking head off at the cunts if I didn't.
"I used to love spitting on light bulbs. Whilst on. Tremendous explosions. Did it one too many times, though, and my parents ended up getting the house re-wired. Cost a fortune, apparently."
"I had a Christmas job at Argos in the 90s when it was less computerised. If I couldn't find a stock item or it was a massive TV, I used to screw up the ticket and move on to the next. Sorry to the people raging when their item wasn't waiting for them having queued for an hour."
"My wife likes to dirty talk during sex, but because of our kids sleeping across the hall, she has to whisper - which means I only hear about every third word."
I often memorise outlandish sporting event scores just incase I manage to travel back in time so I can bet my life savings on them.
"I never finished The Wire, stopped watching somewhere in the third season. My friends all think I watched the lot and if anyone asks I say it's one of the best shows ever made and a tie with Breaking Bad for my favourite TV show."
I'm 48 years old. My husband bores me senseless and our sex life is non-existent. I got in touch with an attractive ex and after a few messages he blocked me. I'm 80% relieved and 20% heartbroken.
"In the early days of the Internet, I once got sacked for going into the office on a Saturday to compile and print a document of all Cindy Crawford's naked photos. Got found out and had to tell my wife that I had quit because I was passed over for a promotion."
"I once went on a date with this girl, fit as anything. She showed up with what anyone else would call a super sexy snakeprint outfit - except me - I'm terrified of snakes, so faked an emergency call off my mum and left. Sorry Megan."

"I'm a paramedic and got called to a complete cunt. He was a real piece of work demanding this and that with nothing actually wrong with him. As we walked outside to go to hospital as he had demanded, I switched off his freezer. Bastard."
"My wife organised a surprise party for my 40th birthday. I accidentally found the guest list in an old note book, about two weeks before the event. She'd put so much work in, so I went along and did my very best to act surprised. I think I got away with it!"

"Because we only have one toilet in the house, sometimes I have to take some baby wipes and poo in our yard. My dog sits nearby, with a look of sheer anticipation on his face, and when I'm done, he eats it like I'd just served him a Sunday Roast, and thus, I never get rumbled."
I am currently serving my notice period remotely and am supposed to be writing documentation. However I'm spending most of my time writing a novel. This is minor compared to most confessions on this site but I'm not used to breaking the rules and it feels super-exciting.
I look a bit like James Blunt and got laid off the back of it once. The girl messaged me after saying she thought I'd be better in bed and that she didn't want a repeat performance.
"After returning watch TV, naked, I jumped onto my sofa and the remote wedged itself up my anus. After several failed attempts at extraction I called an ambulance. I did a pretty good job convincing the doctors of what happened, up until they extracted it and it had a condom on."
"I give blood regularly, but only because they check it so it's a judgement free way of knowing if I've picked up any big diseases or STIs."
"A guy I was fisting clenched when his boyfriend returned home unexpectedly. They had a loud, tearful argument for twenty minutes while I tried to act like I wasn't there and retrieve my hand."
"My best friend joined Twitter just over a year ago and her Tweets have been quite something. Comes across online as completely self-obsessed, narrow minded and argumentative. I have muted her and we've drifted apart in real-life too. Negative energy be gone."
Dad. It was me who broke into your car in 1992. I was cross that you wouldn't let me go out on my bike so I threw a rock at the window. To cover it up I took the tenner in the glove box. I didn't see the man running away either.
My daughter hated pizza crusts when she was little. I've reinforced it since. Every time we get takeaway I pay for cheese stuffed crusts and cut hers off in the kitchen to be nice. They make an amazing starter.
"Everyone thinks that their babies are the cutest, but genuinely mine is; people regularly comment on it"
"I declined a small pay rise this year, stating that it didn't feel right during the pandemic. My boss was very impressed. In truth, it was a selfish financial decision, the small raise would have prevented me from claiming hundreds in tax relief on childcare costs each month."
"As a kid, I once dialled the telephone operator and sang the full theme tune to Boon: Hi Ho Silver by Jim Diamond. When I finished, she and others listening in all laughed and clapped. I've never told anybody that in 30 years."

I have slept with a colleague after work drinks a few times when we have both been very drunk. We don't get on at all but for some reason are drawn to each other when we are hammered. Her boyfriend is the scariest man in the world and I am terrified he will find out and kill me
Posted a picture of my legs and ass in women's gym leggings as a joke without mentioning I'm a guy.Sort yourself out horny guys. The reason my legs and ass look so thiccc is because I've done over 10 years of strength training.I see why people are so upfront about no DMs now.
I discovered the word 'anal' when I was 9. I didn't know what it meant but I used it as an insult to people I didn't like at school. It didn't go down well with the teachers when I called a kid a fat anal from across the class
"Back when I lived in a house of 5 guys, a girl I had a one night stand with left her thong in my room. I put it on my housemate's pillow as a joke, not knowing that his girlfriend was visiting that day. She found it and dumped him. I never admitted it was me that put it there"
I was falsely accused by a very senior director of fraud. When I left the organisation I kept the inside track - lo and behold he was suspended for bullying but they tried to hush it up. I anonymously contacted the local rag who put it on their front page. He was then sacked.
"When I go to Greggs for breakfast almost daily, I read out a pretend list on my phone as if i'm getting other peoples orders but in reality i'm ordering a load of food for myself only. I'm aware I probably have a heart attack incoming but Greggs is top tier."
"For a few years I had a competition going with my parents over who could bring back the ugliest, tackiest souvenir from trips abroad. Except I'm not sure they realised that's what we were doing."
"For years the boss has been forging our payslips and under-declaring our earnings so he pays less tax etc. Probably money laundering too. It's ok though, I turn a blind eye because I pocket about 50% of cash jobs. Everyone's a winner, baby."
I went on a few dates with a guy who had a skin condition where his skin would flake. I ended it as I was scared he would cover me in dead skin if we had sex or if he'd leave a body shape of skin in the bed after he'd been sleeping. He coughed & I watched his skin fly in the air.
"My wife has put on a bit of weight and although she knows I still lust after her, she's reluctant for me to see her naked, even trying to get changed without me seeing. I'm seriously missing the physical contact. I'm budgeting for a few escort appointments when Covid is over."
I have been working a job for three years that could be done by a macro in Excel I could make in 10 minutes. I will never tell anyone as I love browsing Reddit all day and I have zero ambitions in my work life.
"I'm leaving my job at Virgin this week. I'll most be doing nothing but fucking up the accounts of customers that have been nasty and pissed me off. Take that, arseholes!"
My sister and I both had sons in the same year. Throughout their childhood my son had a significantly bigger cock than my nephew's and this always gave me a surge of paternal pride
I'm 90% straight but I've cheated on my wife with quite a lot of guys but never with a woman. The gay 10% of me gets much more extra-marital action basically because it's much easier to meet guys for casual sex than women.
I wondered if my wife cheated on me as both teenage sons clearly have something sizeable knocking around in their joggers and I'm hung like a hamster.

"I work for Govt and folk frequently complain to Ministers about me. Do you think the Minister replies to you? No, I do. Ministers sign anything I put under them."
I worked for a major High St bank. Every week someone came in with £100 worth of 50p coins wanting them exchanged for more 50p so he could outsort the 'special' ones fir his collection. I'd put his on floor behind me and then give him the same ones back again.
"When younger me and a mate thought cumming quicker was better. We had a race, each wanking into a sock. Slowest lost and had to wear the socks. I lost."
I once worked in a garden centre where we weren't given any training about how to care for the plants so I used to just make stuff up when customers asked me
Being furloughed with wife has quashed my 'me time'. I've started wanking in shower and have since discovered they are the best wanks I've had in my life. Orgasms are more powerful when using your imagination instead of watching porn. It's taken me to my late 50s to learn this.
At a house party about 15 years ago. I meticulously replaced the photos in every frame I could find with a slice of bread. Still laugh about it now.
"I love pepper. I over apply it to my food. I imagine I am a wealthy Roman 2000 years ago consuming the equivalent of a kings ransom every day. Of course, it would have been more like a small silver coin at most, but it's my daydream and it makes me grateful for small things."
"My GP put me on Vitamin D because my levels were so low. I generally feel much better, but the best part is my pubes are now silky soft."
Secretly hoping my wife cheats on me so I can divorce her for something other than starting box sets without me

I love following smug Twitter couples purely for the inevitable break ups. Quality entertainment.
"I run a baking club in the school where I work. I teach by example. Whenever a cake recipe calls for eggs, I warn the kids not to lick the cake mix off their spoons. You can bet when they're all not looking, I totally lick the remains of the mix of my spoon, raw egg or no."
I've gone off lesbian porn since I started a new job with a lesbian boss.

Was once at a packed gay sauna when I suddenly had an intense bout of food poisoning. Shat myself in my towel in the actual sauna room and had to tie the towel up round my legs like a nappy to go and hide in the toilets. Smell was so bad they had to close for the night
In my early 20's I acquired the nickname Postman Pat. This was because on the way back from the pub I used to urinate in letterboxes.
"I like to ask taxi drivers ambiguous questions about feminism, race and LGBT issues. If they respond with understanding and humanity, as most do, I tip them a tenner, even on short journeys. If they are gammon bigots, they get the fare and fuck all else."
"I'm a mild-mannered man, but I fantasise about doing unspeakably violent things to the people who designed our workplace software. They have blighted my working life for more than a decade, and I want revenge."
I have a massive tattoo of the band Lostprophets on my back which is way too large to remove. Fortunately most people don't know who they were but when I meet someone who does I just want the ground to eat me up. Talk about fucking regrets.
Whenever I'm shredding household documents I like to pretend I'm the the head of a financial crime network frantically destroying evidence before we get raided. Sometimes I shout for the kids to bolt the door and buy me more time.
There was a skanky fucker at my local pub who would mine-sweep left over drinks at the end of the night. On a few occasions I pissed into an empty pint glass and left it out for him to swig at.
After having a dump in a pub in Brum I discovered there was no loo paper. Thank God for my extra long Daysaver all day bus ticket.
"My job is repetitive and boring it's data entry and since working from home I've 'outsourced' it to my 16 year old son, I showed him what to do and he enters the data giving me 6 hours of my day to get jobs done I otherwise have to do at night- I pay him £10 a day"
Growing up I always thought tit wanks would play a more important part of my life. At school it was all people would go on about. To date I've sat on loads of dick but given maybe 2 tit wanks.
I've ruined so many TV programmes and films that I love by watching them so often when I need cheering up that I now associate them with feeling low
"I work in licensing for some major brands. One franchise's stars are pretty old now, but we don't have enough photos on file for them in their heyday. So we just use CG models."
At my job interview I put on a really posh accent. It's been a year since I was offered the job and I have to put this voice on every day. I feel like I'm leading a double life.
"I'm a Departmental Manager and was hosting a Zoom conference call for the whole department. My partner brought me a cup of tea, but I didn't realise until the end of the call that, every time I took a sip, the words I'm A Twat could be seen on the bottom of the cup."
Every year I get absolutely shit presents for my bday and xmas. No-one has given me anything good in 20 years. I know I sound ungrateful but just once I'd like to actually be grateful rather than pretend

I have a nagging fear that one day I'll die and my family will find a t-shirt in the laundry that they will keep unwashed because the smell reminds them of me. But it'll be the one that I used to wipe up jizz.
"After a moderately successful TV and film actor we were buying a house from pulled out the sale, I spent an afternoon rating their acting performances on review sites and got their average star rating down from a 4 to a 1."
I work for a very large haulage company. We can track every movement our trucks make. I sometimes sit at my work station and go through each driver and their daily routes wondering which one is a serial killer and where they're dumping the bodies.
"On quiet days at work, I'd use the disabled toilet for a wank, using headphones to watch porn. After one session, I removed the headphones to hear loud complaints from a blind colleague who'd been waiting 20 minutes. I darted past him, in silence, in case he recognised my voice."
"I live 2 minutes from a Holiday inn Express, about twice a month me and my flat mate walk in a side door go to the restaurant and have a good feed up for breakfast, we even know some of the staff who think we stay at the hotel on a regular basis"
"I'm a sexworker. There are tons of married men cheating on their wives by meeting random men online for mutual cock sucking experiences, mostly without using protection. They then call me to talk about it while having a wank."
"At the start of lockdown myself and my twin lost our jobs, to make ends meet we started cam work individually at first but soon realised we'd make more together, it blew up, some very famous people are now clients including prominent government officials and footballers."
I once took a shit on a turntable. It was nicely presented at 33rpm but at 45 it flew off the decks
"I lied to a woman by telling her I spoke fluent French and later, during sex, she asked me to speak French as a turn on. I quickly ran out of what few words and sentences I knew and moved on to simply reciting the names of French footballers. Emmanuel Petit really got her going."
"Some years ago, I temped at the HQ of a corporation in San Francisco. In the course of shredding a pile of docs, I came across a receipt for $100000 of women's jewelry that the CEO had charged to the company. I kept that receipt. Never did anything with it though."
"Bought a house from a man I didn't like. Any bills that arrived for him I sent back with I'm paying nothing, see you in court ' written on them."
"I once scrawled a friend's home number into a toilet door with the phrase TV - interested? above it. Forgot all about it until I was round his house and the phone rang, his father answered and got VERY angry. They'd received HUNDREDS of calls and had to change their number."
"I once accidentally swallowed a gold ring, and had to dig around in my own faeces for the next 18 hours until I found it."
"When walking down the high street, I often imagine myself as Richard Ashcroft from The Verve in his Bitter Sweet Sympathy music video. Love the thought of barging into people with not a care in the world."
"I wasn't allowed chewing gum as a kid, but I was ok with that. Because I found the flat, black gritty ones I used to prise off the pavement, were still quite minty."
"I was told to make someone redundant by a weak boss who couldn't face it. She came into the meeting, started crying and told me she was resigning as she couldn't bear working for the boss. I told her to keep quiet, shredded her letter and told her to take the £12,000 payout."
"Sometimes I eat a whole apple, including the pips and stalk, because I can't be bothered to dispose of the core conventionally."
Every time I see the word 'marmoset' my brain automatically says it in a Somerset accent.
"My wife and I religiously watch Eastenders even though we both hate it, it's become a game of chicken between us. We went to a fancy dress party with me as Phil Mitchell and her as Kathy Beale, when we got home we had a hate-fuck that'll ring out down the ages. It was weird."
"When moving house, my wife wrapped a sex toy in a old bedsheet, and stored all our things at my parents mid move. Upon unpacking we found that my mum had washed all our bedsheets, and neatly replaced the vibrator"
Years ago I came home drunk and horny so put porn on. I fell asleep with my dick in hand. I woke up in the morning all tucked in bed. Turns out my dad found me asleep with my dick in my hand. He's never mentioned it to me. I only know because my uncle mocked me for it years later
"As a teen I walked past a closed garage and heard an engine running inside. Thought it was weird but did nothing, kept walking. It was a suicide; the father of a girl at my school. I still don't know how to think about it even now, 30 years later."
"I'm bald and seem at peace with it. However, every 3 or 4 months I have a dream where I get it all back, and I have a cure or a solution and when I wake up it breaks my fucking heart."
"I'm concerned about the reopening of the pubs, because I don't know how to explain to my mates that I'm really into Ru Paul's Drag Race now"
"I'd never seen or used a gas oven until i was about 25ish. For quite a long time i thought that the head-in-the-oven method of suicide was achieved not by suffocation, but by cooking one's own head."
My dentist keeps pushing me to buy an electric toothbrush. This time when I visited i said I had bought one and they said they could see the difference. Im still using manual but not i dont trust my dentist.
"When I filled in the census recently I was so tempted to put my true sexuality on there, which is bisexual, but I put straight as I have put on every form I've ever been asked the question. Sorry census, it's not you, but this needs to remain my secret."
I flinch every time my daughter comes near me because of the number times she accidentally smacks me in the balls. I didn't even want kids in the first place.
I am googling a Dickens book to pretend to my 13 year old that I actually read it when told to do so at his age
"When I'm alone and using some sort of technology I imagine I'm with a recently reanimated, having been found frozen in ice, Victorian gentleman who constantly marvels at my horseless carriage, magic picture box, and rectangular communicator"
I think I see my neighbour regularly drinking himself to death. Seen him plow away almost bottle of gin a night. He's a young Primary school teacher and I'm not sure if I should see if he's alright. I'm not trying to snoop.... genuinely. I want to see if he's ok.
Since covid and lockdowns I have no escape from my husband and his controlling ways. He has installed a lock on his office that only his fingerprint opens. I pray he has a massive coronary in there and no one can save him.
I genuinely love being a lesbian. I regularly shop for bras online just so I can look at some nice tits without my search history being tainted
When hungover and can't be arsed to move I will ask the Pizza place literally over the road to deliver to me. I say I can't collect as the baby is asleep. I don't have children. The baby has been a baby for about 6 years now.
"I sat next to the same guy for 18 months and everyday ate his cereal bar, he started leaving them in his jacket, bag even his car, always found them. I didn't even like them, just enjoyed seeing him accuse everyone but me everyday or just lose his mind"
So excited to go back to work. Not because I haven't enjoyed getting paid to sit on my arse for months being anti-social in lockdown but I'm just happy to see the girl I fancy again. Lockdown has made me hate my husband
All my friends think I'm an under 40 retired millionaire following an extremely successful career in investment broking. The truth is I make £6k a month from my gay onlyfans account. I'm petrified they'll find out and tell my wife.
"When I am reading stories to my kids at night I pretend I am doing an audiobook and really try to act all the parts out. I take it very seriously - if I muck up a word, I imagine that there are people behind a booth telling me to 'cut'."
In our cutlery drawer we have these fancy little forks for deserts that we never use. Except for when I want to use the tip of the handle to scrape out earwax. They are perfectly radiused for a good wax clearout. The other half doesn't and cannot know
"I only found out today, thanks to my wife explaining it to a 5 year old, that thunder is the sound made by lightening. I was told it was clouds rubbing together and I've never questioned it. I'm 44."
"I find, as I cook more and more regularly for me and my husband, that I am apoplectic with rage when he requests a squash for his drink after I've spent hours in the kitchen."
"Matt, it was me who wiped my bum on a sock and threw it out of your window last year. I'm sorry, but you need to buy some fucking loo roll if you're going to have visitors. Please stop going on about it."
"Years ago at an old nightclub there was a separate area away from the dance floor, it had old metal tables with detachable legs, my friend and I would quietly undo the wingnuts holding the legs on, then walk away to watch to carnage as people sat down."
"Sometimes out of laziness/conveinance I'll piss in the bathroom sink, if I have the tap running at the same time I think about the Ghostbusters and don't ever cross the streams."
I have a pretty standard 6 penis when erect but am a grower not a show'er. After any exercise it shrinks to a tiny nub so after football I would have to rush to a cubicle to give myself a tug to avoid shower humiliation
"When walking fast, I lean into the corners and touch the apex like I am in a racing car. In the winter I did this on an icy street, fell and concussed myself. I still do it and can't stop."
Does anyone else arrange oven chips on the baking tray in length order?
"I hated being dad taxi for my teenage daughter and her mates and getting asked to do tip runs etc in my BMW Estate. So I sold it and got a two-seater Smart Car, I look a twat driving it but nobody asks me lifts anymore."
I dated someone for longer than I should have simply because they were a copywriter for a well known juice drink company and she used to have a huge supply of free juice that I'd snaffle whenever I went round.

"I learned of the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, about 90 seconds after cumming, with a big dildo still up my arse and vibrating nipple clamps attached. I'll never be able to tell anyone what I was doing 'when I heard the news'."
"I work for a major charity in the UK and it's worse than you could imagine. The senior team are all right-wing boomers on massive salaries doing the bare minimum. It's a scam. The temptation to write an exposé for the Guardian is overwhelming. Until then, there's Fesshole."
"I buy random bits of garden ornaments: gnomes, plant pots, solar lights etc, and plant them in strangers' gardens. The shitter the better. Poundland often a gold mine for this."
Went back to a girls house for a drink after clubbing. As soon as we got back she followed me to the toilet and started to give me a BJ. The noises I made encouraged her and she thought she was brilliant. The truth was I was burning my arse on the radiator she had me against!
When I make pizza for my kids I always cut them into lots of slices so I can steal a few and rearrange them into a whole pizza shape. They've never noticed.
"Six years ago I ghosted a gorgeous American guy because he was way out of my league & I was convinced I was just a joke to him. Just found him on Facebook, he's now engaged to someone who looks like me, so he did like curvier women. Kicking myself for being an insecure fool."
"Working as a courier I've had to piss in bushes for over a year now, as everywhere is closed. When I can pop into friendly cafes etc again to relieve myself I worry that all the local dogs are going to be concerned as to where I have gone once I am no longer marking my territory."
"I worked in a pie factory in Salford in 1996. I haven't eaten a pie since, and neither would you if you'd worked there."
I got drunk in a nightclub in Sydney years ago. Bumped into someone I knew which was remarkable. The next day I was informed it was 'Toadfish' from Neighbours.
I hope lockdown never ends. My child was born last summer and I've been able to spend every day with them. Dreading going back in to the office and not spending my day lying on the couch with them.
I work at a job centre and it's amazing how many washing machines blow up on a Friday afternoon and people call in asking for an advance. We are supposed to vet them but I always give them the amount they want. I feel like Santa.
"My prick of a neighbour installed an alarm on his car so sensitive to motion that it went off when people walked by on the other side of the road. Since the alarm went off for 8 hours a day, no-one paid it any attention, so there were no witnesses when I bashed in all his lights."
As a kid I used to get sweets from a shop who allowed you to fill your own bag & tell him how much was in it. Usually told him about half the price & he never checked. He went out of business & I felt guilty thinking I did it with my sweet stealing.
I absolutely have a favourite daughter. It's the nice one
"My colleague broke a £700 MontBlanc pen. I was devastated. I brought in sugar-free gummy bears the following day, knowing he'd eat the majority. Check the Amazon reviews for why I did it."
When I dislike someone or they are generally getting on my tits I make a Sim of them in The Sims. I then torture them until they die.
"I'm an ex-Michelin Star chef, have worked all over the world in some of the most famous restaurants in the world and have written for nationally recognised food magazines, but I still have no idea what bay leaf tastes like or why anyone adds it to food."

"After a three day drug-fuelled bender I went to see my Mum to nick a few of her sleeping pills. Found her stash and necked a couple. 2 hours later instead of falling asleep I was rushing my tits off on some of the best ecstasy I've ever had. Dark horse, my Mum."
I working as a Saturday shelf-stacker in a Co-op store before I went to university. A rather posh woman stopped me and asked if we sold lychees. I rolled my eyes and directed her to the cheese counter because duh. I can still make myself blush by thinking about this.
"Found out an ex was cheating on me. Didn't want to admit I'd been through his phone so I took photos of the conversations, remade them in Photoshop, and created a fake Facebook account to send them to myself so I could catch him out"
"Getting older as a gay top is awesome. The amount of unbelievably hot guys in their 20s I've had sex with is incredible, and now I've got a bit of a gut after lockdown the offers are flooding in. It Was an adjustment being called Daddy, but the payoff is definitely worth it."
"In 1997 when I was in my early 20s, I bought an mp3 player off a website called QXL. When it arrived, it didn't work, so I returned it. Instead of crediting me £170, they mistakenly game me £1,700. Never told them, they went bust. Bought a new hoover and pissed the rest away."
"Our child did a poo in it's nappy that wasn't contained. We were shopping at the time and there was poo all over the trolly and food. We made a decision, left the trolley mid aisle, poo everywhere. I'm sorry to who had to deal with what we as parents were unable to."
"I'm short. 5'6. I've always hated being short. Women always want tall guys and men look down at you. Literally. On the rare occasion I see a man smaller than me I get close to them, enjoy the moment, and think - you short little cunt"
"Years ago my boss accidentally saw a photo I'd taken of my boobs, while I was showing him some pictures of my house on my phone. I made up an 'it's not what it looks like' excuse and he kindly went along with it but it was exactly what it looked like and I'm still mortified!"
"If there are people behind me in the car wash queue, I'll always opt for an 'Ultimate' rather than 'Standard'. Fuck those losers that got to the car wash after me."
"I daydream about getting hit by a car so my husband would see how much of his life relies on me doing the planning, thinking, and menial drudge work he doesn't see as worth his time and effort."
"I once paid £46 to watch Ricky Gervais The Invention Of Lying. I didn't want to pay for it, so torrented it. Unfortunately I forgot to stop the torrent once I'd got it all, and I was on a capped internet tariff. By the time I realised, I'd run up £46 in excess data costs"
I have wildly understated the size of our loft to my wife so she believes it full and doesn't keep sending me up there with random shite.
Life has been easier for me since I realised most people want to talk at me rather than to me. Now I can give the most non-committal of responses and usually not even listen. It's a lot less stressful.
"Our neighbors car tax expired in October, I was trying to come up with ways on how to tell them discreetly until they put their house up for sale and stopped talking to us, I reported it the DVLA the day they moved out"
I split up with my wife of 15 years in September and moved out. We have recently been seeing each other again in secret to see if we would work and be a couple again without the pressure of the kids and family knowing. I'm effectively having an affair with my wife.
"I wish my wife would just buy cake rather than creating her own, because she then just expects me to fucking wash up afterwards. And the cake she makes is tasteless dry shit. We're otherwise happily married for 15 years next week."

"Because I sleep naked, and regularly have an itchy hoop, I've started wearing a sock over my hand at night. Saves the big clean on the duvet set"
"Each lockdown our family eating habits has got worse and worse. Now eating with hands, food falling from mouths, burping, farting .... afraid to take my wife out for dinner again"
"I have a diverter on my bath taps which sends water to the shower head. When running a bath, I lean my head in when turning the taps on, then aim to dodge the shower flow like a young Floyd Mayweather. I'm a white man in my late 30s who's never had a fight in my life."
"For 18 years I worked with cattle. Dairy cows and beef. I loved working with them but not a day went by without me wondering what it would feel like to punch one right on the nose. I think I could have knocked one unconscious, if I really tried."
"Had a night out with a few mates. Crashed in his spare room, woke up to his mum spooning vomit out of my airway. Oh and I pissed myself. Still lovely people but the shame I feel when I see them still haunts me."
When I was a toddler I ate my own poo once. I don't remember it but my parents took a photo of it so I now have to live in constant fear of this photo being shown to people.
"I watch Friends on Netflix all the time. Whenever the two World Trade Center towers are shown in the scene-transitions I always bow my head. I'm not sure why, it just feels disrespectful not to."
Started to eat food standing up in the kitchen right after cooking and pretending it's street food.
I check my bosses outlook calendar and don't bother going into work if he's out of office
I'm the member of a local pro-environment group. My GF is a total litterbug. The arrogant way she tosses her trash from the car window should disgust me but it is a major turn on. I know its bad and I'm scared of anyone discovering my littering fetish.
"Years ago I worked for the top UK supermarket. One of the in-store bakers once sucked the jam out of a donut and pushed it back in, rolled it in sugar and packed it for sale. I still can't buy in-store made jam donuts"
"At the start of the first lockdown I promised myself that I'd learn a language, read the 6 books I bought in 2019 but never even opened, and get fit. All I've done is eat pizza, sit on my ass watching old episodes of Rainbow, and put on 30lbs."
"My husband and me have all but given up drugs. It's done wonders for our mental health but crippled our, once adventurous, sex life."
Snoring. Snoring. SNORING. I love my boyfriend but fucking hell I want to put a pillow over his open mouth and stop the noise.
"Working from home has meant that I've secretly watched every series on iPlayer, Netflix & Prime. Now my wife thinks I have an amazing knack of knowing who the murderer is."
"A relative is a copper. He shared a Facebook screengrab of some fox hunt sabateurs he had to deal with recently. Silly of him to share their ko-fi and paypal details, because that helped me secretly donate to their expenses. ✱Chuckles leftily✱"
"I do a lot of concept renders of buildings and housing schemes for a VERY well know architect. I always try and sneak a cock and balls into my designs. Some are subtle and hidden away like a Where's Wally / Willy, some I can't believe haven't been spotted yet."

"A few years ago, my father-in-law asked me to take a look at his phone as he feared it may have a virus after YouTube started showing some dodgy stuff. Nope. Just YouTube's recommend watching suggestions based on previous viewing. It was a sea of recommended porn."
When I was 7/8 I tied my shoelaces together out of boredom in an assembly but didn't realise it was the end. When we were walking out I kept falling over. The teacher kept the class back after school to find out who had done this to me! Sorry Mr Chilterns class it was me
"Have been lying to my wife about having a job for the past 4 months, in the morning I walk round the block until she's gone to work then I go back to bed."
"I didn't want my ex-gf to hurt me in future when she found a new partner, so instead I chose to hurt her first by calling a halt after 6 months of just being friends. I feel awful for doing this as I still love her and now I feel so completely alone."
"I once met a guy for sex and while I was rimming him, his dog appeared from nowhere and started licking my arse as well."
"I used to dream about winning the lottery and retiring young. Having had ulcerative colitis for 20yrs now I just dream about getting through a day without having the shits all the time. Your health is your wealth, as the old saying goes."
When I was 16 in about 2004 I had a wank to what I thought was the Paris Hilton sex tape. Turns out it was just night vision footage of two blokes dressed up as women writhing around on a bed. Still can't get over it.
I work as a database administrator and spend half my day reading all the staff problems that HR add to our CMS. I know all the staffs' personal problems and it's more thrilling than my actual job.
As a teenager before the advent of hardcore internet porn my most used masturbation aid was the Airwolf opening theme. I would attempt to ejaculate at the precise moment that the theme ended and was mightily pleased with myself if I managed it.
I like baking but I'm not very neat at decorating. My friends always ask if my 2yo son helped and I always say yes out of embarrassment.
My wife got us a lockdown puppy without consulting me. She said it would get me out of the house to exercise more. I've now lost two stone and I've being having an affair with a fellow dog walker for two months. I love our puppy!
Thank you to people who have donated.  Please do give your Twitter username so we can follow back you kind people.
Martin Freeman in the Vodafone ads was my idea. Never got the remotest recognition for it. One of several ideas/problems solved there that someone higher than me took credit for.
My iPhone suggests I have a wank every morning by recommending I open my secret browser. They've cottoned on to my daily habit for sure.
"The weird spots on the bathroom wall were not mold. They were stains from a time I drunkenly vomited everywhere. Now that you left me, this secret I kept for years is irrelevant."
"At the age of 36 I have realized I no longer believe in love, art, family, politics, morals. I only obsess about making money and career progression, two things I'm not very good at."
Sometimes when I sneeze with my hand to my mouth I catch a little bit of phlegm in my palm. Very quickly I lick it back into my mouth and swallow it down. I think this makes much more sense than wiping it somewhere but the missus finds it absolutely revolting.

"I used the same barber shop /barber every 4 weeks for around 30 years. Then one day I bought some clippers and let my wife cut my hair. She did such a good job, I never went back. That was 8 years ago and I still feel guilty."
"I started a new job and the people I work with seemed pretty sound, wanted to get into their WhatsApp group for ages, now that I am I realise they're the most humourless, racist, misogynistic twats going, I fucking hate it here now"
"As I strip naked to get down to it, my girlfriend always picks out the fluff from my belly button."
"At cub camp, when I was 8 years old, I was stung by a nest of wasps. My therapist believes I am using this as this'll as a metaphor for sexual abuse, but I literally got stung by a nest of wasps. He won't let it drop."
Here's the best public confession for March 2021 - honestly think this was the best month we've seen - so many funny ones. Do follow @fesshole if you don't already and do share this so we get even more great confessions. https://t.co/fSysZ3rcqx
When I'm skipping tracks by tapping my AirPods walking around town I pretend I'm undercover taking orders from my handler. It's usually a shit Britpop song
"Lived with my in-laws for a while whilst my wife and I did our place up. One night I walked in on my father-in-law going down on my mother-in-law in the toilet. They were both in their 70s. It put me off sex for a few decades but still, respect where it's due."
"Ever since my asshole boss found out I'm a lesbian, he's been jokingly trying to get me to have a threesome with him and his girlfriend. He doesn't know I've already fucked her twice at work xmas parties."
"30 years ago, feeling very out of my depth at a posh dinner party I drank far too much. After dinner, over coffee, jokes were told. I have no idea what possessed me, but I told a joke with the punchline 'fuck off you red nosed cunt!'. The horrified silence haunts me to this day."
I think I need to wear a support bra when I'm operating my forklift over bumps and rough ground as my tits wobble so much.....I'm a 54 year old male
"I have 11,000 pictures and counting in my iPhone. I need about 15 of them. I'm stuck in a parallel vortex where I am destined to pay exponential amounts of money to Apple to store this crap. I fear if I delete them my soul will be erased."
The music went quiet in the strip club and everyone heard me open my Velcro wallet
"Went to a gay club on a bar crawl with work friends, went for a piss and was propositioned by 2 guys giving each other loving tuggies in the corner. I'm straight so politely & gratefully declined, but it was the biggest confidence boost I'd ever had. Smiled for days. Lovely guys."
"My partner needs the TV on every moment of the day, always mindless crap like Gogglebox and Made in Chelsea. Before she moved in I didn't own a TV. Not sure what will happen when the TV breaks next week."
"In the late 90's, just after Christmas, we sat in the pub and filled in a newspaper classified section saying that any un-wanted Christmas trees could be left in our mate's front garden. People kept leaving them, and he didnt know why."
I'm an artist who does commission work. When I have a particularly demanding client I hide insults in the textures of the piece. No one has noticed.
"I have two teenage children I love so much, but like most teens they rarely tell me anything about themselves any more, even if asked.Except their dreams. They tell me about their dreams in exhaustive, tedious detail. I have to pretend I am interested. I could tear my hair out."
"I watched loads of porn, nothing excites me anymore - However I just watched the first episode of 70s TV show Chocky the mum had no bra on and a silky blouse and it gave me the biggest hard on I have in ages"

I used to do admin for a firm of solicitors. 80% of them were absolute morons. I have no idea how people so stupid got qualified or continued to be employed.
"When taking a leak, I like to review the colour my piss to provide an indication of my hydration levels. If the piss is clear, I reward myself by silently singing good good good good hydration... to the tune of good vibrations by the beach boys."
"When my wife and I are arguing, I drink a big glass of milk before bed, I'm lactose intolerant, the gas is deadly but I'm a heavy sleeper and don't notice. She is not and does."
"Lockdown was a relief. It gave me an excuse for why I spend my weekends at home, alone. Without it, I'm the lonely failure I know I am."
"I'm a uni student with a 45 year old sugar mumma. I have a PS5, iPhone 12 and my Master's tuition debt is paid off. My sugar mumma is also my mother's best friend from childhood."
"I often fantasise about being a cowboy in the Wild West, like Clint Eastwood. The reality though, would be horrific. I shudder at the thought of outside toilets, poor hygiene and inadequate health care. And horses are fucking terrifying."
I'm an atheist but sometimes when I'm walking by a random church and I see a mass about to begin I'll go in and sit. It's all nonsense of course but it's lovely being left alone with your own thoughts with none of lifes distractions available.
Made my Science teacher think I had submitted coursework that I didn't bother doing. She gave me a high mark as she thought she'd lost it. Got an A for my GCSE. Sorry Miss Armstrong.
Used to have the best gak dealer ever. He'd drive to wherever I was day or night. The convenience meant I kept on scoring long after I wanted to stop so I deleted his no but I'd used it so often I knew it by heart. In the end I had to shop him to the police just so I could stop.
My partner left his wallet at my place so I sneakily took a look inside and found an old newspaper clipping about someones sexual fantasy with a pet. I have no idea what to think & want to ask for clarity in the hope it's innocent but I fear the worst. Ignorance really is bliss
"I'm very much into Peloton but haven't told anyone else for fear of being judged as a tosser, which I am"
From a train window recently I saw a railway worker under a raised station platform taking a shit in broad daylight. Couldn't look away. Saw everything. Wasn't very efficient at wiping his arse. Then the train moved and it was like the credits rolled.
When bored I sometimes play a game of Russian roulette on my phone. I type a message saying either I love you or I hate you and send it out to all my contacts. Not quite the Deer Hunter but it still gives me a visceral thrill.
I hide sweets and chocolate in the salad drawer in the fridge and the fruit bowl. Kids & husband would never think to go in there.
I worked in a colonoscopy unit for several years. We regularly treated patients for the after affects of vigorous or unsafe anal sexscapades. If you have anal fun please use LOTS of lube and go gently. I saw some eye wateringly damaged rectums and lower bowels.
As a kid me and my friends were paid to deliver business cards for the local taxi company to hundreds of houses in the town we lived in. We got bored very quickly and dumped the majority of them.
When we were kids me and my brother always liked staying over at our parents' friends house on the way back from holidays. They never knew it was because there was a stack of porn mags in the attic room we slept in.

Sorry Suzanne - the reason you've been complaining about a fishy smell in the office that no-one else can detect is because I've been dipping your headset mic in a bag of scampi fries for the past few months
I have a racist dog and I have no idea why. It's embarrassing
"My GF and I have a system, 3 bottles of wine on Friday, 2 on Saturday, 1 on Sunday. It has saved both of our jobs."
"Many years ago, when I was around 15, me and a drunk mate stole a tyre from a scrapyard near by, we then thought it would be funny to roll it down a hill. Damage we caused to cars/park benches made the papers and caused plod to do a talk at school about vandalism. Still feel bad."
When I do a messy pee at someone else's house I wipe the toilet rim with my foot and walk that pissy sock all over their house the rest of the evening
"I'm a bloke who has had short hair my whole life until lockdown meant it's grown. Realised one of the best pleasures in life is washing and shampooing longer hair. Shame I look like a bellend, but it's a great feeling"
I met my girlfriend several years ago and she had beautiful long hair. We became a couple a few years later during which time she had her hair cut shorter. I always told her that I loved her long hair. During lockdown she has grown it again but now she looks like Dave Growl
"I turn my Snapchat location off for 3 hours every time I go to Tesco, which is several times a week, because I don't want people to know I'm so lonely during lockdown I go out just for a change of scene."
"I'm 45 and have smoked since I was 18. My parents still don't know I smoke as my mum, a heavy smoker, made me promise when I was little that I'd never smoke. I've been living a lie for 27 years."
My office has a battery recycling bin in the staffroom. I fish the AAA ones out for my remote controls and they always last a good few weeks. Saved literally tens of pounds on new batteries.
Used to regularly chat with a teacher at school as I could have decent conversation instead of usual teenage BS. Got called into Heads office because teacher thought I was being sexually abused and was reaching out for help. I wasn't and since then I've avoided befriending anyone
I struggle to get the charge cable into the hole in my iPhone and I know this is a metaphor for my ability to hit the spot with my knob - I'm hopeless.
"My wife is very attractive, but she has an odd childlike tone that she seems to think is a 'sexy voice' and it really takes the wind out of my sails, and I don't know how to tell her without hurting her feelings."
"Every time I plug the USB cord in correctly the first time, I hear a stadium - sized crowd cheering and an enthusiastic commentator shouting 'Is there anything this girl can't do?'"
"If you ran a commercial radio station that was on a final warning from the Radio Authority in the mid 1990s and one problem in that phase leading you not getting your frequency renewed was the phoned-in trafficjams on roads named after IRA terrorists and trade union leaders, s..."
"Listen, I dont care who you think you are but if you leave your shite on my floor it goes straight up the Hoover no questions asked right?"
I found that my teenage son had been looking at porn on our PC. After deleting his history and explaining to him that it gives an unrealistic depiction of sex I showed him how to use private browsing.

"I once went back to a blokes flat for a drunken shag after a night out. Half way through, doggy style, his prick mates burst in and did a naked conga through the room. It ruined the sex and and ruined that song for me at parties."
"My mum died young, her brother was a nice guy but an oddball who also carked it, he left me and my siblings a surprising sum of money. I should have put it in a pension or something, but instead I spent it all on blow-jobs from high class escorts. Best money I ever spent."
"I'd secretly love to absolutely whunk somebody round the head with a frying pan, just to hear the satisfying klang of kitchen utensil on skull."
I kicked my heroin habit -- which was secret -- by hiring an hotel room and going cold turkey/using Subutex I sourced on dark web whilst telling my family I had gone to play a poker tournament for the week.
"When I was 10 I had a crush on an older girl. She told me she loved Rosetta Stone and as we'd just covered this in school, I wrote up the history of this artefact complete with pictures and sent it to her. She meant the band Rosetta Stone. I still cringe now and I'm 54"
"I got sacked from my job in a call centre for a well known high street bank. They kept paying my salary for 6 months afterwards. This was 20 years ago, and I still get anxiety thinking they will realise and ask for the money back."
"I've been a paramedic for 20 years . When people ask me what's the worst thing I've seen, I usually tell them a story about something somebody shoved up their arse. I don't think they could handle the murdered kids or fucked-up suicides. This job has ruined me."
Was in a 2 floor busy nightclub in Edinburgh a good few years ago. The amount of free drinks obtained by asking for 3 bottles of beer then asking for 3 shots after the beers were put on the bar was unreal. Scooped the bottles and went downstairs. Not even close to being sorry!
"Every friday on the way home work I drink a flask of tea made with a large amount of cannabis and then consume the mashings mixed with yoghurt. I am off my face all evening, but my wife and kids never seem to notice."
Scrolling my wife's friend's insta I accidentally liked an 8 year old bikini pic so now I need a new identity and to move to Brazil
"I often play very niche/geeky music, like old TV themes tunes and idents and stuff like that, with the window open in the hope that maybe one day some other connoisseur will hear it, and we'll fall in love. Or at least, I'll get a knowing nod from another middle-aged man."
"When I rented my first flat, I turned the gas meter around to spin it backwards. This was before they got wide to it and added diaphragms to stop people doing it. Saved thousands though. Fuck them."
I went to a strip club with fake £50 notes and had a great time.
"I love sneezing on the steering wheel of my van. No solids, just huge, wet sneezes. I never wipe it down either."
"As a well-endowed gay man, I can't believe how many good-looking blokes will travel across town for a slightly bigger than average cock. I honestly don't get their obsession but hey I guess I shouldn't complain."
"I like to cup my hand expectantly over my bum hole to receive a fart, wafting into my face, much like sampling a fine wine, I can then decide whether I should waste my time basking in the ensuing cloud of filth. The true joy of a curry on a Wednesday night, is the Thursday."
"The number of staff where I work has increased by many hundreds in the past year. But the number of toilets hasn't. As i am one of the first in, each day I put up a homemade 'Out of Order' sign on a cubicle door ensuring I have my own personal and clean toilet each day."

One day my wife will cut her hair short and start looking like her mother. I dread that day.
Told a guy that I couldn't commit to anything due to my new job. Really it's because he had a weird looking dick.
I'm secretly jealous every time a friend says they're getting divorced. Sometimes I forget to put on a sad concerned face and instead react like they're telling me good news until I catch myself.
"I complained via Twitter to a well known Coffee Shop about a broken cup, they agreed to me picking up a replacement, I just had to show them a direct message. I've used it 27 times already. I've given most away but when I find a new branch I can't help myself"
"I have a law degree and a successful sales career. In lockdown I 'fixed' the dishwasher using a bent teaspoon as a spare part. Six months later it's still working. This is more satisfying than anything I've done in my career, and possibly my life"
My partner makes the most hideous hiss in an attempt to scare the local cat away from our house. Little does he know I have been feeding it smoked salmon when he's not around.
In the 90s my flatmate moved & left loads of stuff. I took the computer bits and kept them in my attic for years. In the end I took it all to the dump. Including a working Apple Lisa 2 and peripherals. Worth £1000s now. Feel sick whenever I see anything vintage computing rela...
"I watched American Psycho 20 yrs ago & ever since, whenever I'm having sex doggystyle, I do the Patrick Bateman bicep curl & pretend I'm looking in a mirror. It makes me feel like a Sex God. My wife caught me doing it the other day & laughed her head off. It's killed the vibe now"
Sometimes I have a green pot noodle for lunch at work. I throw away the fork I have used because I can't be arsed to wash it. There's now only 1 fork left. This hasn't gone unnoticed. There has been an email and a passive aggressive note stuck up on the kitchen. I have no regrets
My husband constantly scratches his crotch then smells his fingers.Through lockdown I've noticed it being together all of the time and it repulses me.I've asked if he's got a problem as he keeps doing it. He does it slyly thinking I do not notice but I do and I want a divorce.
"Before lockdown, I played guitar in a few rock bands, to a reasonable level, but had to keep my hair short due to my main job and my dickhead manager. In the last year, I've grown my hair, I look like a total rock god but all my gigs & bands have folded. Fucking livid about this!"
"The only reason I work out is because I have genuine doubts that my marriage will last, and I want to be hot if and when it ends."
Our neighbour has started knocking for a chat every day during lockdown. Started as being a pleasant distraction but I'm now starting to dread the door going and being bored shitless by the little twat for an hour.
"Age 15, attempt to light fart after a nice shower. Had heard it possible but sceptical. Flash of blue flame that turned orange as it proceeded to utterly consume my carefully cultivated pubes. The horror."
"FROM ADMIN: Running @fesshole takes time to moderate all the entries - did you know there's been 54,000 confessions submitted at a total of 1.8 million words? If you fancy showing some appreciation, the price of a sausage or two would be appreciated. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"My boss is an evil drunken bullying psychopath to his underlings, his public image is a sweetness and light humanist. I once added some of my own shit and piss to one of his many bottles of single malt in his office fridge. My regret is that it wasn't anthrax"
"In 2001/02 I'd buy 200 fake £1 coins for 40 quid from some lowlife, go to an out of town supermarket and pretend I was putting my trolley back. When approaching the bay I'd spot a 'mark' and swap my trolley for a real pound. I'd rotate around 4 shops and was raking in £160 a..."
I worked for 8 months as a camera man in porn. The girls were generally easy but instead I played Fifa with the male actors. Beat most of them too.
"My mate told me many years ago, how his girlfriend would eat the end off a creme egg, he would jizz in it and then she would eat the egg afterwards. This plays on my mind every Easter."
"I cheated on my fiancée of 9 years, 2 years into our relationship and told her about it recently. She's given me another chance but I can tell the relationship is ruined and always will be. Don't do it people, either don't cheat or don't ever tell them."
"I'm a 30yr old mum of 2 demons. When they're asleep my fave thing to do is go bat shit in GTAV. Fucking prossys, getting lap dances, blowing up cop cars and just terrorising NPC. It's been helping me stay sane during lockdown"
After watching the video for Paul Simon's You Can Call Me Al repeatedly on MTV in the mid 80s I was convinced that Paul Simon was Chevy Chase. Only realised my error when I saw Simon & Garfunkel do a benefit concert for Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
As kids we used to push £1 coins into dog shit. The winner claimed the spoils by breaking up the turd to receive said coins. I never really pushed mine in so watched my mates pull shit apart for the fun of it
"Had an open packet of bacon in the fridge past its sell by date. It looked okay so I threw all 6 rashers into a pan, looked at it, and realised this oversized portion of fatty outdated meat nobody really wanted was the perfect metaphor for my existence."
"As a lazy teen, I used to rub the 'results' of my constant masturbating into the carpet under my bed. When my parents sold our house, this large patch was like hardened superglue, and no amount of scrubbing by my mum would shift it. Now I'm a responsible adult, I just swallow it."
Recently had a rotten tooth took out and I miss the flavour that would occasionally be emitted from it
I only found out when I was 18 years old that test tube babies weren't grown in huge test tubes like freakish frankenstein experiments.
My name wife thinks she caught me wanking but I was actually sitting on the toilet backwards trying to get a skid on the front
I found my soul mate on Tinder. He was everything I could ask for in a partner but I couldn't be with him because he was short. No one I've met since comes close to his amazingness but his height really bothers me.
The inside layer of my saucepans are peeling off and right now I can't afford to replace them. When the kids ask what the black bits in their mash potatoes are I tell them it's just herbs and seasoning!
"My wife went shopping and forgot to take her mobile phone, which gave me an opportunity to search for her hidden messages and friend requests. I then realised I didn't actually care, so left the phone alone."
A random stranger outside a shop asked me to help him lift a large box into his car the other day. It was the highlight of my month and the most social contact I've had in days.
I send the phone numbers of my exes to the random dudes on the internet who send me dick pics.
At age 10 I hung around with a bad lad from 'the estate' but told my mum he was nice really. In reality he talked me into help him vandalise a grave and torching a farm shed to try and get a reward for alerting the farmer. First time I've ever mentioned that and I'm 49 now
"When a kid, for fun one day I put an apple onto the end of a garden cane, swung it backwards and then 'flicked' forward. It didn't just go far, it cleared a wall of conifers. And smashed through a neighbours window, apparently in room with a baby sleeping in. Felt bad for years"

"Aged.10 I lived in a village, our house had a long drive . One day I took a piece of wood and painted VILLAGE SHOW with arrow and put it at the end of the drive then went to see a friend, On return there were 7 cars causing gridlock and lots of confusion. Claimed no knowledge"
Sometimes my 4-year-old son is just a little cunt.
"When someone's starts a conversation with I shouldn't really tell you but I immediately say don't tell me them, I get immeasurable pleasure from seeing them squirm not being able to tell me the secret"
"On vacay in Milwaukee, I stopped at a cute bookstore. My morning coffee caught up with me. In the midst of shitting in the store's bathroom, I find there's no TP or paper towels. But the room is full of books. So I use a few pages. I discreetly left the store out the back door."
"When my daughter goes to bed I play Animal Crossing on her switch for about an hour. Clean up her town, sell fish to make her more bells. She thinks her character is working while she sleeps. Makes her very happy."
"In my first job at Burger King when I was 16, I was cleaning trays and the manager told me to put some elbow grease into it. I thought it was an actual product and he watched open-mouthed as I searched for it."
I go out of my way to load the dishwasher as badly as possible. At least I used to - now I'm not allowed near it. Win.
I'm a grown man of 35. When I'm listening to music and someone asks me what I'm listening to I'll say some random band/rock music. I'm really listening to Disney's Moana soundtrack. That whole soundtrack is banging. Nothing better to lift the spirits.
"One of my first proper girlfriends gave me a piece of advice that has stood me in good stead since: UB40's Red, Red, Wine has the perfect tempo for clitoral stimulation."
Next door's cat climbs through my bedroom window most nights to lick my testicles
I'm 25 years old and it hurts so much seeing my hair fall out already. I know a lot of people say just shave it off but it wouldn't suit me at all. My self-esteem's been affected so much and I don't feel attractive in any way now.
"My wife's sister and her husband stayed with us for a few months while they were moving house. He kept eating all our chocolate biscuits and never bought any, so I filled the biscuit tin up with chocolate digestives that I'd wiped up the crack of my arse. He ate the lot."
"I'm really looking forward to the day my chest hair meets my belly button hair. It's growing about 1-2 cms a year, so it should meet in 2032"
As a teenager I completed a Christian Alpha course at a local church as I seriously had the hots for a born again christIan lad and wanted to get him naked. It worked.
I'm a modest average guy but I've been blessed with a beautiful piece. Both a shower and a grower. Sometimes walking about the house I'll just pull it out and look at it like a proud parent.
The black mirror pig fucking episode still haunts me. Sometimes it just pops into my head and ruins my day. Wish I'd never seen it

My best friend died nearly 3 years ago. I don't think I'll ever really be over it. I like to write WhatsApp messages to him because he still exists on my phone and in some strange way he may listen.
"Whenever I do an Ocado order, I secretly get a bag of Haribo and snaffle them throughout the week without my wife knowing. Honestly, this is as exciting as my life got under lockdown."
"Once our parents die, I don't think my brother and I will see each other again. They are all we have in common"
"Fresh out of college I worked for the local Tesco as a Stock Controller. I worked hard to get stocks to a level where I could just coast, which meant donning a thermal suit and climbing all over the cages to the back where you could sleep all shift and eating free magnums."
The basis of my wife's love is when I stroked her cheek tenderly after I kissed her goodbye at the train station. I was actually surreptitiously wiping my snot from her cheek.
If I see the last of something on the shelf I'll often buy it just to spite the person who genuinely needed it
"My teenage son used to bore me rigid with his monologues about Manga cartoons and crap bands, to the point where I'd pray he'd shut up. Then he got severe depression and now rarely speaks, and doesn't leave his room. Be careful what you wish for."
"I've been pretending to like Pink Floyd for years just to have something to talk to my dad about. Can't stand them. Even the Syd Barrett stuff, and find everything afterward increasingly boring, self important and as if they're somehow 'above' being in any way entertaining."
There are few things more alarming than a screen grab of your own private parts on a random porn site. Thank goodness I used a fake name.
After my husband died I had his ashes made into diamonds for my daughters and I. I stuck one diamond on my favourite sex toy. I miss him so much and would give anything to have him back but at least now he is satisfying me in bed.
I set fire to my convenience store business to collect insurance money. Remembered I'd not renewed my insurance as it started burning and nearly killed myself trying to put the fire out. I was hailed as a hero by my staff and the local press.
"I was seeing if I could suck myself off while my partner was out and got so close before my back completely locked up and left me stuck, naked, in a very compromising position. She came back and helped me back into shape, half believing my explanation that I was doing sit ups"
I bought my wife nipple tassels to spice up our live life. She thought they were curtain tassels and I felt the moment had passed so I never corrected her.
Lockdown has been so boring I have started having an affair with a guy who lives down the road. My husband thinks I go jogging - I am having to starve myself to make it look like it's having an impact
"Recently after a huge dump I looked and there was no toilet roll, waddled to the kitchen with trousers round ankles for kitchen roll, that was out as well. Improvised and used 2 slices of white sliced bread."
My wife is convinced that putting coffee grounds down the sink will block it and tells me off for doing it. I always put the grounds down the sink when she's not around. I've been doing this for over 10 years and It hasn't blocked yet.
I always give myself and extra £1000 in Monopoly... and still usually lose.

"In the late 90s I posted stuff on Usenet under my real name, that if discovered would destroy my life. Thank fuck no one looks beyond the first page on google."
"I love my boyfriend dearly, he is the kindest and most wonderful soul I've ever known, however if I could make his abusive bully of a mother vanish with no consequence- I would."
"I, for a laugh, shat in my mate's toaster on a cocaine bender several years ago. I told him the next morning whilst he was having a - very hungover - bath. He still hasn't forgiven me. To this day I still send him pics of the 4-slicers whenever I go to Costco"
"My 2 year old insists I read several Mr Men books with him each night. They are absolute shit and surprisingly long, so I just make up shorter stories based on the pictures, so I can actually have a fuckin evening."
I'm from NZ - the much praised NZ Covid response. Secretly I wish we had more lockdowns. I love WFH and not dealing with all those smug cunts.
I took a photograph of my arsehole to send to my boyfriend and accidentally sent it to my mother. She asked what it was and I told her it was weird looking fruit I had found in the supermarket. Now she's asked to come round and try it as she's never seen anything like it.
I run a small pet crematorium and unless it's someone I know or the customers especially nice I usually just bury the pets and fill an engraved urn with random Ash. No ones complained and it saves alot of hassle.
My best mate and I are in our 40s with Audis and kids and air fryers etc. During lockdown we have rediscovered the joys of weed via edibles and now get stoned together despite living 246 miles apart. It's bloody lovely.
"I was a proper slag in my late teens and early 20s, shagging anything with no regard for consequence. I'm now reformed and do things like growing radishes, but I live in perpetual fear that my husband will encounter the contemporary version of 1999 me and run off with her."
"When I little I heard the phrase he may be important but he still puts his pants on one leg at a time. I started putting on my trousers both legs at once, sitting down. I still do it and feel a little bit of pride every time. I'm 46."
When my brother was after Xmas tips on his paper round he wrote Xmas cards to everyone he delivered to. I was jealous of his enterprise so I opened every envelope the night before and added bits like I'll kill your dog.
"We've been deciding what to call our new puppy when she arrives next month. Wife and kids vetoed all my nerdy suggestions till I said April after her birth month. It's now a serious favourite, as long as they don't realise Capt April was the 1st captain of the USS Enterprise."
My wife accused me of having weird nipples. I was so pleased when watching Passengers to see that Chris Pratt has nipples that look exactly like mine. I think he might be my identical nipple twin.
Sometimes I tease my phone by setting a 20 minute timer and then cancelling it one second before it would have gone off.
When I was in sixth form I briefly tried to keep a diary on my iPhone notes. That ended when my girlfriend at the time discovered this and we fell out when she read that I had a wank over the Katy Perry music video California Gurls
"Years ago at a friends house having a catch up & a takeaway. As I said my goodbyes, I gave my friend & his wife goodbye hugs. But when I hugged his wife goodbye, someway/somehow her earlobe got into my mouth & I gently clamped onto it. To this day I still shudder."
"To hide my burgeoning coke habit as a 20 yr old I taped my drugs inside my friends guitar I was borrowing. My Dad, a Detective in the MET, took it to a works party as part of his costume. My friend was convicted of possession with intent to supply and got 18 months suspended."

This stuff about millennials finding full stops aggressive has given me a great new way to express my displeasure at those I work with when they do crap work
Me and my best mate had a blood pact that if we were ever terminal we would unplug the machine or push the button and end the misery. Well the nurse looked me in the eye and left the morphine pump unlocked in front of me. I couldn't push it. I'm sorry mate.
"I grew up playing Sonic from a young age. The underwater stages were really panic inducing, especially once the drowning music starts. It still scares me deep down to play them now. I am 30 years old."
"At the next local election, I can't bring myself to vote for my own party's candidate for mayor, because he looks like Noel Edmonds"
"I'm a 30 year old woman and I've just had a 10k payrise to £72k. It's amazing but I'm a bit embarrassed about it, it's more than my parents' salaries combined."
"Over lockdown everyone I know has either had a baby, moved house, got fit, promoted, started a business or gained a qualification. Basically really got their life's in order. My biggest achievement in the last 12 months has been switching from BT to Sky."
"Thanks to recent trends in vinyl and my chaotic music taste, I have had to start using Spotify to check that I've put my records on at the right speed in order to avoid a repeat of the time I had to sagely nod along to something that was blatantly wrong, just to save face."
"I would secretly love to go out into the street and squirt shower gel and shampoo everywhere, just to see how high it would go, and to watch the cars froth up into a fruity scented mess when it starts raining."
All the porn on the entire internet and to this day I still wank to Robin Askwith's 'Confessions' trilogy.
"My wife drunkenly slipped on a patch of ice in our garden and broke her spine. She's now quadriplegic but doesn't remember a thing about what happened. My guilty secret is I'd promised to clear away the icy path, but couldn't be arsed, and watched TV instead. I'm sorry my love."
Couldn't remember my Dad's birthday but he used to be famous so I looked it up on Wikipedia.
"I thought I had bum cancer and was really down about it. Turns if you are a male in your late 40's, under pressure, eat lots of spicy food and have the odd tricky shit, then its quite likely not to be cancer. Never been happier to have piles."
"In the mid-00s I used to work for a music marketing agency. My job was running dozens of fake personas on forums & MySpace promoting our bands. If you ever wondered why loads of people were enthusiastic online for a mediocre indie act's middling second album, they were all me"
"As a kid, I'd hold my foreskin when I went for a piss, inflate it like a water balloon and let it go like a fully loaded supersoaker. I'm 41 and still do it now. Great for clearing up the aftermath of porcelain paintball."
When I go to the toilet I sometimes say things like sludgy sludgy bottom or dirty dirty back bottom as I wipe. I have gotten so used to doing this that sometimes I say these things in the stalls at work.
I'm a manager at Tesco. Your petty complaints get laughed at and printed off as badges of honour. Keep them coming.
"As a teenager, drunk one night, me and a few mates decided to uproot ALL the For Sale and To Let signs from one whole street's gardens and re-plant them all neatly across several rows in one randomly chosen front lawn. Took fucking ages. Absolutely exhilarating."

"I'm a Voiceover Artist. When voicing my client's corporate videos, I like to compliment them on their quality scripts.They love it, but in reality the scripts are a load cliché-wridden, self congratulary, meaningless shit. Happy to take the money though."
"I've swim in the sea during winter for years. Outwardly I tell everyone the recent boom in outdoor swimming is fantastic, but I'm secretly fuming it's so common cause old women don't bother to stop me and say ooh, aren't you brave? anymore now every other bastard is doing it."
"I regularly stick 4,5 or even 6 Krispy Kreme donuts into the 3 donut pick your own box in Tesco's and often enter them at the self check out as Tesco's own donuts."
"Whenever dealing with a plumber, mechanic, builder or any other tradesmen, I have a massive paranoia that I'm going to lean in and give them a peck on the cheek. I've no idea why, I've never done such a thing. I'm a straight man, btw."
The real reason I curl up on the sofa is because I love the feeling when I fart on my foot.
"I'm a single woman paying good money to dating websites that I only pretend to use, so that my best friend doesn't find out that I'm completely in love with him, and run away screaming. I make up date stories too."
"My wife buys me white Calvin Klein pants cos she says I look good in them. Trouble is, I like to push my farts out for maximum volume, but the result is that my white pants go misty brown in the arse area. Wives: Buy your guys black pants."
I lick the toilet paper before each wipe. Have done so for at least 35 years.
In a previous job I built a spreadsheet which significantly improved data entry efficiency. It was too efficient and led to the company getting rid of one of that team. I password protected the spreadsheets formula cells and when I left set it so that it broke three months later
"I deliver parcels and when I get to the 69th everyday, I look at the person I am delivering to and consider 'would I' 9/10 I walk away laughing at an old man picking up his medical supplies. Living the dream."
"1986 one Saturday morning the TV show No. 73 was filming live at my local beach. I cycled down, looked over a railing to see Neil Buchanan interviewing Siouxsie Sioux just below. I hooked up the biggest greenie I could, aimed, released and it landed on her head. On live TV! S6E10"
"As I entered Sainsbury's, a lady at a stall asked me to donate to some kind of dog kennel. No chance said I, to her apparent surprise. On my way out I realised it was for guide dogs."
Been with my girlfriend for 2 years. I just woke her up in bed with a really loud fart. She laughed and then went back to sleep. Thinking of proposing as she must be 'the one'.
"My husband and I have been married for nearly 10 years, I do love him, but I also secretly resent that he gets handsomer while I just turn into an old woman. I know it's shallow, but every time I see a younger woman glancing at him, I want to scream how unfair it is."
"I tell people I've always known I was gay, but it was definitely Kylie Minogues in her split white dress and side boob that caused my sexual awakening."
"When I was a kid and I looked at old photos/TV shows, I thought that older generations saw everything in black and white and needed an operation to allow them to see in colour."
Husband teaches mathematics in a top university yet is unable to use a tape measure or work out height x length x width. We have so much shit that doesn't fit I'm selling it on eBay and keeping the money.

"I've written a diary every day since 1990. For years friends have asked: 'what have you written about me?' or said 'I can't wait to read your diary when you're dead, I bet it'll be OUTRAGEOUS!' I always respond with a sly smile, but they're in for a shock. It's dull as dishwater"
"Sometimes, if I ever get asked for directions and I don't know where the place is, I'll just make shit up and send them to some random location."
"I got attacked in an unprovoked attack by an 18yr old when I was 12, he had to write an apology letter to me- I tracked him down on FB this year and found out where works and reported him for racist comments 3 days later he put a status about 'snitches' and looking for work"
My husband has many annoying traits but by far the worst is when he does the washing up and doesn't role his sleeves up and they end up saturated and he doesn't seem to mind- it's the same when he washes his hands he never rolls his sleeves up and it drives me mad !
One year on from the start of lockdown and I still haven't got through all the toilet tissue and pasta I hoarded.
"With the lockdown, we've spent more time sitting on the stairs listening to our asshole neighbours and apparently they think we're assholes too."
"I got a tattoo on my arse, when I was young and slim, of a sexy lady showing the viewer her arse. The fatter my arse gets now, the more lopsided hers gets."
"My husband only likes one particular brand of marmalade, which is not stocked at Lidl. I can't be arsed to go elsewhere so I bought lots of another marmalade. He says he won't eat it so have been slowly mixing it in with the original and he hasn't noticed."
"I can still remember the last time my ex-wife properly kissed me. After that, things were never the same again and she divorced me. I fall asleep crying about it sometimes, regretting i never tried harder in our marriage. Don't ever take the one you love for granted."
I spent over 2k on a gaming pc for the kids so I can mine Bitcoin to pay for my weed smoking habit without the wife knowing.
"I used to rent a flat below one of my friends. His partying got out of hand and I complained to the landlord thinking they'd give him a warning, but he got evicted instead. We blamed the girl next door. He still doesn't know it was me."
"My next door neighbour's Census 2021 letter got delivered to me. I didn't give it to her because I want her to get fined £1000. Fuck you, Nikki."
"I once registered as a female on a dating site to check out the competition. It was hilarious and convinced me that most men are total dicks, without the slightest clue what women find attractive. 'My interests are drinking beer and playing pool with my mates.' What a catch!"
Me and my wife are meant to be losing weight together for our wedding this year. She hasn't eaten chocolate or takeaways for over a month. I've just eaten a whole big pot of Onken in the bath
"Was having a quick tug in the bathroom this morning, just as I got to the point of no return money shot I noticed a guy from openreach watching me on top of the telegraph pole."
"Our work is doing an activity challenge where we get prizes if we attend thing like yoga sessions. I've logged in, switched off my camera and am enjoying a lager instead."

"When I'm a bit down, or even just a bit bored, I go onto Twitter, search for abusive terms and report some people for being abusive arseholes. Every so often I get a list of all the people who've been banned. Really cheers me up."
I've fitted alarm sensors to most of our windows. My wife thinks it's for security but it's actually so I know when she's opened one and I can close it before the house ends up colder than a Siberian winter.
"I wear Apple EarPods all the time when I go out even If I'm not listening to anything, so strangers won't try talking to me and I can pretend that I can't hear people I know if they call out my name."
Sometimes when I'm having a shit I pretend I'm in the diary room of big brother discussing who I want to nominate out of my house
The button placement on my iPhone 11 makes it really easy to accidentally take a screenshot whilst watching porn. You have to be really quick to delete them from the family icloud folder.
"Once a year and pre-covid I would leave my worn out suit in one of the cupboards provided at work, knowing it would eventually get thrown out. Then I'd complain my possessions had been disposed of and get a new suit as compensation. Next year: shoes."
I was a bit preoccupied going up the stairs a few days ago. Somehow ended up holding a cup of tea whilst having a poo. Drank it.
I judge people in my head based on how weak or strong their squash is made
After being caught short I used my socks to wipe my arse and threw them in a bush. Everyday I walked past my shame hanging there until one day a dog walked past with my shitty sock in its mouth
"Friend has decided she is an artist and is going to sell her work. She asks my opinion for every new piece. I want to scream I've seen GCSE kids do better work, but I've been kind, encouraged her & now she thinks I'm her #1 fan when really I loathe her work: she has no talent."
"I have the best kids in the world. So proud of them. I try to tell them how great they are but they just think I'm being cringe and saying it because I'm their Dad and I have to. I'm not saying it because I have to, I'm saying it because it's true. I wish they'd just accept that."
"We've recently driven past a field of broccoli. I'm late 40's and never knew the marvel of it. Don't know what I expected, but my mind is truly blown"
"My son caught worms and passed it onto the rest of the household, me included. Now I'm obsessed with pooing into a tissue and examining it. I can see why Gillian Mckeith loved it so much its fascinating!"
Every time I need cheering up I go read stories of how people lost all their money in get rich quick or pyramid schemes. I might not be perfect but I'll never be that greedy or stupid
Pretended I was dyslexic back at uni to get a free computer. Promptly exchanged it for a nine bar of skunk & began a successful drug dealing career which paid for my tuition. Had to keep up the charade of being dyslexic for a few years which is harder than it sounds.
"The day of his Greta Thunberg tweet, I edited Lee Hurst's Wikipedia page so it used all gender-neutral pronouns. It lasted less than ten minutes, but man did it feel good. You can still see it in the version history."
"When I drive alone I have loud fake conversations with my wife, friends or my dead father about things that bother me. Always feel better afterwards and my marriage has improved so much since I've started."

"I used to work at Wetherspoons whilst studying at uni. If any drunk customers were being arseholes and they were ordering their drinks in rounds I would charge them for an extra pint, then either pour it for myself at a later point or give it to my mates for free if they came in"
"When I eat a mini egg or similar I imagine it's a spaceship, and I am an intergalactic monster attacking it. I picture the crew panicking as the sugary shields fail and cracks appear in the hull before I tire of their struggles and devour them."
"I punched Adam G in the mouth at primary school because he said punch me in the mouth. It was exhilarating and terrifying, as blood poured from his mouth. I'm glad it happened because I would never normally punch a mouth."
Being pretty much the only person in the office has removed all the joy from farting in the lift.
"Smoked a lot of weed with my hookup at his home & fainted because I didn't eat. I could barely move and was scared he could do anything. Instead, he went out, got me food, we sat & talked & he drove 2 hours to drop me off home. A great friendship was formed."
"I work at an agency that deals with YouTube influencers. Internally we run a book on which ones are most likely to get done for sexual harassment, it's on the company intranet as Potential Brand Risks.xlsx. Most of the men are odds-on"
"Whenever I do a long squeaky fart, I mouth along to it and do that mariah carey follow the pitch with your hand thing"
A former classmate has become a recording artist although not particularly famous. As I remember him being a prick at school I regularly check and delete him from the 'Notable Alumni' section of the schools Wikipedia page.
"I served an elderly woman a lottery ticket that ended up netting her 1million in the Sainsburys I worked in, I used to say to everyone who I sold one to 'you know where I am' as a cheesy joke, I never saw her again I was expecting at least a thank you."
"I work in a butcher's, 95% of our stock comes from the same place as Tesco, if you see anything flavoured it's because it's going off, we rarely wash our hands regardless of what we've handled. You'll happily pay 30% more for this quality and service than at Tesco."
"My brother, 8, was late home after playing with friends. Mum was furious. He told her he'd been hiding in the woods from a man who tried to get him in his car. Police were called, neighbours went hunting, it was in the papers, we weren't allowed out alone for years. He lied."
"I told my son I'd still love him as much when his little brother was born. It's not true, I have to share my love now and it breaks my heart."
"To my husband, as you live on your phone/Twitter and follow fesshole.... stop complaining about your lack of sex and change your underwear more than 2-3 times a week. I do the laundry, I know"
I still wear all the BHS boxers my mum bought for me when I was a student. I'm 41 now and mum's been dead for five years. Quality tailoring lasts.
"Alone in the house as a teenager, I'd just had one off the cuff and went to the loo to grab some bogger to clean up. When I got back in my bedroom the spunky patch on the bed sheet had greatly diminished in size and the family cat was sitting on the windowsill."
"If you're the person who lost approx 4 grams of frankly some of the best quality cocaine I've ever had the fortune to come across outside Bow Road tube station circa 2005, be consoled in the knowledge it went to a good home. That was some good shit. Soz."

"When attaching the various accessories to my cordless Dyson vacuum cleaner, I like to imagine I'm an assassin assembling my weapon. The 'click' of a Dyson is very satisfying."
"Just broke my wrist which has forced me to go lefty. I've never wanked so much, it feels great. Genuinely worried I'm only a few away from just dust coming out"
"I am purposely late every day to collect my son from school.. I hate other parents, all of them. Cannot stand that playground chatter. He is 10 and is always there waiting looking a bit sad."
"An innocent mistake in a previous NHS data processing job meant that a cancer patient didn't get their follow-up appointment, someone only found this out a year later. They tracked it to me, told me on my last day and it still haunts me 4 years later. I hope the patient was ok."
"My husband used to tell me he was going for a Tantric massage once a month prior to Covid- I thought naively it was a fancy word for a massage, only when I mentioned in passing comment to my work colleague have I found out what they actually are... he's in the shit now!"
"20 years ago I scraped together £400 for a ring and she said yes. When she asked how much I'd paid I told her £2K to sound impressive. She still brings it up, and everyday I wonder how angry she'll be when she finds out."
Some friends & I made nitroglycerin in the school chemistry lab. Our sports teacher was a complete shit & we blew a crater 10ft wide & 10ft deep in his precious cricket pitch.
"When I was younger I just assumed by the time I was 40 I'd've grown out of all my bad habits. I'm now well into my forties, married with kids, yet I still eat my bogies, bite my fingernails, pick my toenails, piss in the shower and do some occasional shoplifting at Tesco."
When the barber asks if I want the back 'square or tapered' I haven't a clue what he actually means so I take a 50/50 punt every time.
Whenever my colleague makes inappropriate jokes I always pretend to be naive and not understand them so that he's forced to explain them.
"Had Covid vaccination yesterday, feel rough as but not due to jab just got too pissed last night. Wife waiting on me in bed, can't tell her the truth, and actually don't want to."
"When I tried to give up smoking I convinced myself that as long as I didn't buy fags or lighters I'd still given up. Took to following people round bristol waiting til they dropped their fags and retrieving them. Bizarre behaviour, but the lengths addiction pushes you to."
I thought all I needed was the dog but now I'm in my mid 40s and regret every day not having a baby
"One night every few months I decide I'm not going to brush my teeth that night because I'm an adult, I'm tired and I can't be arsed. I feel gloriously anarchic then ridiculously guilty the next day."

"Recently lost about 20kg, everyone thinks it's a New Years resolution but in truth the only reason I did it was because I felt so ashamed that I broke the toilet seat during Christmas."
"When I open a bottle of beer, I imagine I'm an executioner and I have to make it as quick and painless for the bottle as possible. I've become very good at doing it in a swift, smooth motion, but I get genuine feelings of guilt when it goes wrong."
My first wet dream was about my mum. I don't fancy my mum even a tiny bit. My subconscious did that to me when I was 13 and I can never erase that memory.
I work for a hedge fund that backed brexit and made some political donations. We've made 1000's of millions from betting against UK companies and £ since. The bonus's sure ease any guilt. I'm 29
"I moved from London and lived in seaside town in the South West. I got myself on Plenty of Fish as I didn't know anyone. In the 1st year I shagged 7 single mums, a fat bird who squirted like a fountain, a pre-op trans woman, a 67 year granny and fisted a lass with one leg."
I once put contact lenses in on top of others to see if I could get super vision. Instead it just all went cloudy and I tripped and chipped a tooth. What a cunt.
"When I was ten I stuck a pin through a bar of soap and the tip broke off. I panicked and hid it in the airing cupboard. Months later, my dad starting screaming while taking a shower. The soap company sent us a huge case of soap by way of apology"
I buy a pack of 5 pairs of socks from Asda per week and just put them straight in the bin when I have worn them. I do feel a bit bad about the waste but washing and drying them also seems wasteful and I love the feel of a new sock
"I've gotten so used to licking my plates after eating in these lockdowns, I'm afraid I'm going to forget that it is not the done thing when we can go out to eat again in public"
My petty revenge on customers who piss me off that I don't get immediate revenge on is take a clear picture of them on the CCTV and turn them into joke figures and memes in my group chats. The next time I see them the anger is gone and I laugh.
Everyone in the neighborhood calls our neighbor Fat Jack my husband hates him because he is naturally gifted with tools and helps everyone and is very popular. After catching a glimpse of him undressed one night I now know where he got his name. Fat like a beer can! Wow!
"I put mugs into the cupboard as precisely as possible one mug distance apart. I then try to slot another mug into the gap without touching the others.I justify this as a useful skill by imagining that if there is ever a Hunger Games trial in 'mug distancing', I will get to live."

"I once ordered a sex toy for the wife. It got delivered to the primary school down the road as I had accidentally entered my house number as the number for the school. They opened it in error, but found the delivery note with my no. on and called me to go collect it. Never have."
"Video games are shite these days, but some have terrific ambient music on the pause menu. I'll take spending hours with the game on pause and just chilling out to the music over playing the thing any day of the week."
When I left home I forgot to take my porn mags with me. Imagine my surprise when I came back to find that my mum had neatly filed them in a lever arch file. She never discussed it with me.

People who do a full food shop at Tesco petrol stations should be shot.
"Every Spring I secretly hope that the petrol lawnmower won't start so I can fanny about removing and cleaning the spark plug, cleaning the carb and spraying starting fluid in the intake. I don't know why."
"I work in a pub, but obviously they're shut.I've been going in each day to drink the out of date beer. The taxman thinks its been disposed down the drain and we got a bit of a refund."
My partner spent a fortune on some dungarees. He thinks he looks 'arty' but he looks like a fucking overgrown toddler and now I'm repulsed by him.
When we were kids my little brothers had a massive medieval castle Lego set and they treated the horse Legos so badly I felt compelled to rescue them. I still have them. I'm 36. I'd do it again.
I bought a load of Bollocks to Brexit - Bollocks to Boris stickers to leave on lampposts and other street furniture near the local Tory MP's house. Someone's been going round peeling them off and I really hope it's him.
"Me and a mate painted a zebra crossing on a busy road outside my house. Now it's a busy zebra crossing creating a long backlog of traffic. Neighbours love it. Drivers, not so much."
Wife caught me in bed staring at the laptop with my hands hidden under the covers. I snapped the laptop shut immediately. Too ashamed to admit I've got into cloud gaming and was hiding an Xbox controller.
"For a sugar fix I've taken to eating cake decorations. They're kept on the top shelf of a high cupboard and stored in what look and feel like pill jars, so I pretend I'm Johnny Cash when he was addicted to amphetamines"
"Since the start of this lockdown me & partner have decided to get fit. My mum lives with us so most nights after we get our kids down she listens out for them, we roll a joint, go a long walk & get high. It's been a form of therapy & we have never been happier ❤️"
I really like that polyphonic singing soundtrack on Isis videos. I've only ever heard it on the tv news and am too scared to search for more in case I'm put in a list by Priti Patel
"I write for a craft beer blog. I always wax lyrical about the latest over-hopped IPAs, go on about their aromas, flavours and palates. The truth is, most of them are rank and you can't beat a nice cold can of Carlsberg or any other lager that beer snobs look down their nose at."
"When I'm making myself a sandwich I always dig down into the loaf to get at the good bread near the bottom, and leave the stale crummy bread on top for the wife and kids to eat. Why? Because fuck them, that's why."
I always change my wifi router name to 'Icanhearyouhavingsex'
"My mum kicked me out of her house when she found out I'm gay, she never answers my calls. I still try to call every weekend though. I don't know why. I walk past her house most days, sometimes I wonder what would happen if I just knocked on the door. Never had the bottle though."
"I'm 78 yrs old. Never smoked, hardly drink. My wife died 8 years ago. I have all my faculties and it's fucking abysmal. All I do is wake up with random pains, and it's all likely cancer. I go for a piss and then my dick decides to carry on after I've finished. Kids.. Do drugs!"

"I've never been to a wedding without creating a scene. Multiple fights, lots of nudity and plenty of bridesmaid blowjobs. Yet I still get invited regularly. I guess people just need someone to spice up the first day of the end of their lives."
"I've become middle-class somehow. We now have towels that are not to be used, just displayed in the bathroom."
I have recently grown a beard and get great comfort from clasping my jaw and scratching it rhythmically with a finger nail. It reminds me of the sound at the end of old records with the needle in the lockgroove.
"I used to cover my hands in laminate flooring glue and let it dry, just to pick it off.If the glue not readily available, fingers covered in nail polish and then dipped in cotton wool - wait till it's dry! - would do.So satisfying. Hours of fun."
My wife's pregnant and trying to eat as many foods as possible to widen the baby's palate. I made a joke about the baby being able to taste my spunk. No more blow jobs for me until October.
When lockdown finishes I really don't want to visit my family and definitely not my in-laws. I want to travel but not to visit them. I just don't like them very much.
Just spoke to the pizza delivery guy in a Dutch accent and no idea why. I'm English and live in Hertfordshire.
Sorry Carol. It was me that put a mattress in your skip without asking.
"Once per week, I pinch the packed lunch biscuit out of my kid's packed lunch. Not even sorry."
For years I didn't know what vinegar strokes were. I was confused why my mates would stop bragging about their sexual conquests and start discussing condiments.
"When this fucking lockdown shit is over, my lazy useless partner is getting dumped. Make no mistake about it, folks - when someone simply can't be bothered, they're treating you with contempt. Get fucking rid. You deserve better."
Friend I've known for over thirty years literally ghosted me for absolutely no reason at all at the start of the pandemic. All our mutual friends have no idea why and neither do I. tried to connect but he doesn't respond. Honestly broke me up that my best mate just did that.
"I have the misfortune of looking very much like James Corden. I am frequently hit upon by surprisingly attractive women, mainly milfs in their forties. I am happily married, but often wonder if this can happen to a lookalike, the real Corden must be fucking himself senseless."
"Since COVID I've reassessed my finances. Changed to smaller car, lowered bills to market cheapest and cut unnecessary spend, saving £450/month. I've wasted £54k over the past decade and I wish I'd done this sooner."
"Until recently, I thought RuPaul's Drag Race was a show about cars. I got quite the surprise when I watched it"
When my brother came to stay he complained my tapwater tasted strange. He'd been using the glass I keep next to the kitchen sink for when I can't be bothered going upstairs for a piss.
My pubes grow the entire length of the underside of my shaft so I bought one of those trimmers with the name that's a pun on landscape on the basis that their YouTube ads claimed a nick-free shave. Fucking thing tore my poor cock to ribbons.

I work for Vodafone and my personal phone contract is with O2.
"For a few years I've carried tissues around with me at all times. These days it's in case I need to wipe my toddler's nose, but a few years ago it was for wiping my own nose after a night on the cocaine. I miss those days."
"I concede about 95% of arguments with my girlfriend, even when I'm not wrong. Taking the blame us just easier than arguing.I often dream about having a 3rd person in the relationship. Yes, threesomes would be great, but mainly for a witness to prove I'm right in arguments."
"When my partner goes out I often plonk our toddler in front of YouTube for considerably longer than we normally consider acceptable, and just have a quiet coffee. I'm sure she doesn't do the same, since she is basically a superior person to me."
"Worked at a petrol station in the 80's. Me and my colleagues used to violently shake cans of pop and put them in the fridge. When someone bought one, it was like waiting for a bomb to go off. Great fun!! Apologies to anyone who fell victim."
"I've been saving all the grease that I squeeze out of my nose pores, and when I've accumulated enough I'm going to fry an egg in it."
I work for an organisation that promotes independent local business as an alternative to big corporations. I'm pretty evangelical about it. In the last 12 months I've order 107 packages from Amazon and get a weekly £100 delivery from Tesco.
"Just over a year ago my wife asked for a divorce, there were no signs she wasn't happy, we barely argued, said 'I love you' constantly, she said there was no chance of a future together. 14 months later I rent a crappy flat & have resigned myself that I'll never be happy again."
"When I walk the dog and have to pick up and bag its poo, I like to pretend I'm a Native American tracker working out what type of animal passed this way and how long ago"
"I built a home gym in the garage during the 1st lockdown. I now go to it just to hide from everyone and get some peace, I don't even workout there now, I just sit in silence"
My work from home routine has been utterly derailed by the arrival of spring lambs outside my office window. I can watch them all day and achieve nothing.
"Start of every November I post notes through my neighbours' doors asking them to be considerate with their use of fireworks, because of the PTSD I picked up in Iraq. Total lie. Never been. I just prefer the peace & quiet."
"I used to buy chips at a Chinese Takeaway on my post-boozer walk home. Lady who ran it got the idea that I supported Arsenal, and always yelled How Arsenal doing? at me. I couldn't disillusion her because she seemed so happy, so for years I became an expert on how Arsenal doing"
"When I was about 14 I found my dads collection of porn tapes, there was about 8 in total. I did what any normal kid would do, I rented them out to my mates. Red Hot Dutch was my favourite and also the one with the scene with 2 women and gaggle of quacking duck men."
Guy was sending me dick pics but didn't realise his camera was set on 'live' so if I pressed the photo it would be a little video of him holding it up and then sadly flopping down after. Never told him.
"I really, really, really fucking hate Tom Jones. My wife wanted to call our daughter Delilah and I immediately vetoed because I didn't want to subject her to a lifetime of having that dog shit song sung to her whenever she introduced herself."

"No one at my job apart from me understands Excel, macros or data. I spend most of my week scrolling idly up and down a spreadsheet while listening to music and podcasts. I probably only really do proper work about an hour a day. They look at me like I can do voodoo."
Today I lost my virginity. I let him put it in my arse. I have regrets.
After three days sober I've realised why I drink so much. It's because I'm an insufferable prick who can't stand even my own company.
"FROM ADMIN: In memory of Prince Philip, @fesshole will continue to run horrible anecdotes from horrible people all day and into the future."
"After watching American Pie when I was 11 or so, I popped a mince pie in the microwave, took it upstairs to the bathroom, locked the door..... and burned my penis"
Twice a month I do ketamine alone in my bedroom. I truly believe these nightly have had a positive impact on curbing the lockdown depression. It's very meditative. I can't tell anyone or they'll think I have a problem.
"I worked for a company that rented fruit machines. When we would fetch one in for repair, the pub manager would empty the money box beforehand but almost always forgot that the feed tubes were full of pound coins as well. The ones collecting the machine always got the money."
"Thanks to lockdown have completed an experiment go a year without a haircut, teenage me wanted long hair but never managed it. My girlfriend says she likes it, but frankly I look like Brian May, not Kurt Cobain. Can't wait to get rid of it."
"I've taught my dog to sit on a pouffe, by simply pointing at it with a click of my fingers. Honestly I think this has been my greatest achievement during lockdown."
"I once paid a colleague 20 quid to shit in a sample box for me after a food poisoning outbreak in the work canteen. He got poisoned I didn't, but I did get two weeks off at full pay thanks to his contaminated turds."

"Well if YOU think differently, then here's the link:"

"I work in IT and rarely know what fixed a problem, so I make shit up. People find it more reassuring than a shrug and a Dunno, working now innit. The Boolean variables were discombobulated because of a broadcast storm, so I had to reverse the polarity of the matrix inverter."
Sometimes I put my wireless headphones about a foot apart to trick them into thinking I am a giant
I'm 35 and have never owned a vibrator. I just use my hand. Last night my flatmate told me she has eight. EIGHT. I feel like someone who still dries their clothes in a mangle.
"One joy in my life is to buy an ice cream or a chocolate bar, sit in a public place eating it dreamily and seeing kids look at me enviously as they walk past."
"Lockdown has been a bonanza for plumbers, we've never been so busy with people using their own toilets all the time. Add to that the middle classes buying that bamboo bog roll in bulk, blocking septics everywhere, and it's been an excellent 12 months professionally"
"For my BSc and Masters degree, I did not read a single academic book. Everytime a paper was due in, I used a thesaurus, the internet, some booze and careful re-phrasing, making sure the references 'looked ok'. I couldn't look anyone in the eye at graduation."

"I once applied some inappropriate graffiti to a tree on the grounds of my high school. I was never caught, and they ended up having to cut the tree down. I don't feel bad about the school, but I do still feel bad about the tree."
"If you ever spent a whole saturday morning staring at an endless loading screen for some not-yet-available ZX Spectrum game in Smiths or John Menzies, that was probably my doing."
The wife called me by mistake when she was supposed to be calling the Chinese restaurant to order. I was in the next room. I put on a fake Chinese accent and gave her a load of shit so she threatened to talk to my manager.
My wife thinks I'm being good when I only eat one donut out of a five pack. She doesn't know I buy two packs and eat five donuts in the car on the way back from the shop.
"Had a vivid dream about an ex so I googled him when I woke up and almost twenty years on, he now looks like Michael Stipe, so I win. But then he is a rich doctor and I'm unemployed, so maybe he wins, I dunno"
Late 90s a lad from work got his 1st PC. He was a bit dim & had given his card details to a few porn sites. We got somebody to print up a fake letter from the police saying his name had come up in their investigations & could he pop in to the local station for a chat. He did.
After my kids forced me to watch Toy Story for the 50 billionth time I started to pretend Buzz Lightyear says 'I cum in peas'. Can't unhear it now.
"My wife asked me how many women I'd slept with before I met her. I told her, truthfully, 15. If she'd asked me how many men, it would be close to 300."
When I put something in the microwave I like to serenade it by humming the theme from The Magic Roundabout.
"Pulled, very drunk, at a party. Felt a bit ill, went to the bathroom, she followed. We snogged against a wall, then she 'headed south'. Whilst my cock was in her mouth, I puked. Loads went in her hair. Unbelievably, she helped me clean it up. Thank you, random girl, and sorry."
I once had lodgers to help pay my mortgage. Ended up putting most of their rent up my nose.
"I'm a Doctor Who fan. Whene I watch a Doctor in a non-Who role, I work out a back story as to how they're still actually the doctor, just passing time. This is easiest with Peter Capaldi in The Thick Of It, and hardest with David Tennant in any other role he ever plays ever."
"When I was 12 I tried to steal the money from the coin pay meter in my bedroom. I managed to get the front off and access the coins, then electrocuted myself, and was thrown across the room, all for £1.50."
"My husband has a girlfriend in America. I know nothing physical is going on but the emotional affair is killing me. I die a little more inside everytime I see her name pop up on his emails. He doesn't know that I know and I can't tell him, the thought of being alone is worse."
"My first job was at McDonalds. I was 16 years old. A few months in, I grabbed a sleeve of lids that were on a high rack. The plastic sleeve got caught and when I pulled, it tore open and about half the lids fell out down into the fry vat. No one saw, I didn't say a word"
To the arse who parked their four by four down the public footpath so no one who lived there could walk out their house without squeezing against the wall or falling into a bunch of stinging nettles - if you are wondering who keyed your car...it was me

"I once worked as a temp at the London 2012 offices. I made a tidy profit selling hundreds of different pin badges that I found lying around in store-rooms to collectors on eBay. Some of the more desirable ones went for close to £100 each, and they came in boxes of 36..."
A mildly famous actress who used to live in my flat gets an annual cheque for old TV episodes she was in back in the 80s and 90s. I've emailed her agent multiple times to change her address but now I just nosily look at how much she could have had and throw them away.
Shopped my neighbour to the council for building a fugly massive shed without planning permission. Serves him right for putting his recycling in the wrong bin.
When I was a teenager my dad's business had a shrink wrap machine so whenever I bought a new PC game I would copy it & then re-shrink wrap it and take it back for a full refund.
"Once walking through Tesco I saw a guy I knew from somewhere, so said hello to not be rude. Stood chatting for at least 2 mins before he hinted that the reason I knew him was probably because he played in midfield for Liverpool, and we'd never met before. Still cringe now."
If I glance up at the microwave clock and it says 8:08 or 9:09 I count that as a small win to start the day in homage to the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines.
Best bit about lockdown and being furloughed is that the wife's belief the kids seem to like me more is because I'm a novelty as away working so much has proven rubbish. Most of a year with them and I'm still firmly number 1 parent. Not even close
"Starbucks provides stickers on coffee bags with star codes, which are redeemable for star points to get stuff for free. I like to surreptitiously peel some off any time im at the store and redeem 50 points on mobile order to get a highly customised, overpriced coffee for free."
"When my son was a few weeks old, he did an explosive shit in a park. I pretended not to know how to change a nappy and asked a stranger to sort it out which she did. Thank you to that woman"
"I work for a large energy company, and can confirm that 80-90% of positive reviews are either paid for or written by us at managers instructions"
"About once a month, at 20:00 I sit down in a quiet room and watch my digital clock. I spend one minute remembering every year as the clock ticks 20:00, 20:01 etc. Sometimes I sit until 20:59 thinking about the future too."
"I know where my 20 year old hides his weed. Everyday when he goes out meet his mate to exercise i.e. to have a spliff, I roll a joint from his stash."
"I often bid on high-ticket items on eBay with no intention of buying, just for the cheap thrill of it. I lost out on a Learjet by £1.50 and a £2.5m Superyacht I accidentily won three weeks ago is still asking me to 'complete payment'. I'm short exactly £2.5m..."
On a first date with a hot girl I was greeted warmly by name at the cash point by a beggar. I told her I knew him via charity work I did with the homeless. She was impressed and I got laid that night. In truth he and I regularly smoked crack and smack together at his squat.
I made an anonymous report to crime stoppers that I saw a man having sex with a Labrador whilst I was on an evening walk and gave my father in laws description and address. I saw no such thing but he's since stopped kissing it in public.
When I clean mirrors I jump into frame out of nowhere and fire the spray at it like I'm James Bond in the opening credits
Food made by children makes me gag just thinking about their snotty little hands touching it. When proud parents bring in their kiddie made delights in to the office I chuck my offering straight in the bin. Yeuke!

Today marks the day that I have been paid £63k for a year to work from home. 90% of my time hss been playing pokemon go
I often wonder how far I could kick a toddler with a good run up.
"I worked in a pub where I got treated badly by the owners so I left. I set up a fake tripadvisor account and wrote the most terrible review I could possibly think up. The owner of the pub replied - he was angry, very angry. I was happy, very happy."
To all the worms I deliberately cut in half with a spade when I was small: I am truly sorry.
"Since my Mum voted for Brexit, I can't bring myself to buy Mother's Day and 'Mum' birthday cards with messages like You're the best Mum in the world! because it really doesn't feel like she is any more. I still buy her a card, just one with a bland or blank message instead."
Every week I do the kids maths quiz on the BBC website. I always get full marks and feel really pleased with myself. I'm 35 and work in data science.
"My husband's friend Steve is a total cunt. That is all, I just wanted to get it out there. Steve is a cunt."
"While having an affair, my biggest fear was him dying at my place and having to somehow dump his car and corpse somewhere far away, staging it like an act of autoerotic asphyxiation or something so I wasn't implicated."
As a teen I desperately needed a piss. On way to loo the house phone rang. I answered. It was a girl I liked. Too embarrassed to say I'll call you back I stood in the hallway talking while pissing my pants. It was an enormous piss. Never even got a snog.
I have an obsession with a famous actor. I cant orgasm unless I'm thinking about him. When my husband is rutting away on top of me I think of how much better the actor would do.
When I was doing private tuition I requested access to the WiFi to help teach. If they had Sky and I didn't like them I would record random programmes on their sky box
My son moved to a Greek island but I can't pronounce it so whenever anyone asks I tell them he's moved to Crete instead.
"Booked to see a concert with my girlfriend a couple of years ago and then we broke up, it was delayed due to covid and now it's due to be on later this year we have both got new partners not sure how to address this issue?"
A few years ago when you ordered expensive booze off Amazon you could ask to send it back and they would let you keep the drink and give you a full refund. Ordered about £1500 of drink before they stopped it. Cheers Bezos
"My home schooling 13 year old had to make a model robot and submit a photo of it. Knowing it would be thrown out straight after taking the photo, we trawled the internet looking for a 'Homemade robot' photo.  We screenshotted the photo and submitted it as his. He got top marks."
I pay a small fortune for a private dentist. My old one left and a younger one took over. She did two fillings this week and it was obvious that she was inexperienced and frankly slightly terrifying. I'm not changing though because she pressed her tits into my head the whole time
"Many years ago I helped out in a circus, the snake was pregnant but the generator failed, snakes having to be kept at a certain temperature I wired the snakes heater into a council lamp column and blacked out the street"

"I often forget people's birthdays and only remember when I see people messaging them. I order something for delivery and then ask them if my present has arrived yet. Oh no it hasn't, bloody couriers aye? Not been found out yet."
"Every time I lock my car with the remote key I say 'Love that noise' like Alan Partridge in Alpha Papa, even though my cat locks silently"
I have never lied to my children aside from questions about Santa. Since my teens I have taken copious amounts of class A drugs so now I'm dreading the day when they ask me if I ever took drugs?
I let my kids have a 'yes' day where we have to do everything they say just so I could have sweets for breakfast. Sweets for breakfast was their first request. Result!
"When I was 8, I collected loads of bees in a jam jar, put the lid on, and shook them till they were all dead. I am 49 and have regretted it and thought about it every single day since. I am so ashamed."
I do a lot of design work for undertakers and it always pisses me off when the deceased's children want Together again at last on the Order of Service because I know it means At least now they're both dead and we can get the money
"Someone wrote it in to complain about our company using a mixed race couple in an ad, so now when I pick stock images I use non-white people as much as possible to annoy the racists."
I am done with my live-in boyfriend but we've changed my Virgin Media account into his name in order to get a faster higher broadband speed. Have returned my hub and everything. Can't split up with him until I figure out how to get my internet back when he has left.
"I keep spreadsheets to record all kinds of things; personal finance, alchohol units consumed, 5 a side footy goals per game, etc. This obsession is now way out of control, i now have wife & kids behaviour scores, mood v wank regularity.There's something wrong with me isn't there?"
"On a cold and snowy morning, when I was about 14, I found a sheep with its neck caught in some barbed wire. I tried to help but it kept kicking out at me. I watched it die because it wouldn't let me help. I still have nightmares."
"I regret the mutual split with my husband. He is such a kind, loving man. He still makes sure I'm ok, but I have a new partner. It broke my heart today when he said he thinks a woman likes him. I want him to be happy so I said that was great news."
Every time I use the self checkout in Tesco I change the language to Welsh once I'm done. I can't speak a word of Welsh and live in the middle of Bedfordshire.
"3 years ago, I brought some absolutely top quality sausages to my mate's birthday barbecue. When he put them on the grill, I was appalled to see he pricked them with a fork. We've been lifelong friends, but I can't help think less of him and it still makes me angry."
"I've stated doodling swastikas while I'm on work calls. I have no idea why. Sometimes I don't realise I'm doing it and look down and see a page full of swastikas. They're quite satisfying to draw, but I really should stop."
"If I'm ever feeling down or a bit lonely, I respond to a daily mail article about Megan and Harry in the comments section, doesn't matter if you are mean or not you get loads of likes"
"I ruined Sunday's roast dinner because I had to sneak off to get over 100k points on Tetris before anyone else in the house had a go. Got it in 1 go, take that family!"
"I went on a lockdown park-walk date with a woman and her dog. I tried to make a fuss of the dog so I'd look good but 'hello gorgeous!' came out as 'hello sexy!'. It was a short, quiet walk. The longest of my life"

"I live in a shared flat and keep a secret robot vacuum in my room. I don't let it out to clean the rest of the house because I resent my flatmates for having more money than me. Fuck it, no free rides."
I'm not as busy as I like to make out at work. I just walk around with a pile of files and a hurried look on my face but I mainly play candy crush and sneak off for a tug in the toilets.
I had the crushing realization that I'm old and past it and am now invisible when I was was in a lift earlier today and a young good looking girl got in and proceeded to start popping zits in the lift mirror. Didn't even register I was there.
"We got a small 2nd dog at start of lockdown. No interest. Today, I love the smelly, barky little fucker more than any of my three kids."
"I'm always secretly thrilled when one of my mates bails on our weekly Zoom quiz, because all the funniest moments involve taking the piss out of his hideous fiancée."
"As a freelance tech journalist, I'm required to take my own photos of gadgets. In one photo of a smart watch on a popular site, my wrist is actually my engorged cock. Serves 'em right for always butchering my copy."
I have developed a habit of smilingly saying Excrement! as fake praise and don't know how to stop
"As a keen cyclist, I left a well paid job to be a bicycle mechanic. 10 years on, I have my own successful repair business. But I hate cycling, work too hard for fuck all income, think most of my customers are twats and I haven't ridden a bike in 2 years. I'd rather go for a walk."
"3 years ago at a wedding reception I was sat alone like a misery guts, when my wife's hot blonde friend drunkenly sat on my knee, kissed me on the cheek, and whispered I think you're very attractive in my ear. That was it. I didn't do anything, so why do I still feel guilty??"
In 1989 I stuck some chewing gum on the cement post outside of what was then my dad's house. Whenever I go back to that town I always check and it's still there now. No wonder this country's going to the dogs.
"My wife was a massive cokehead. She swore she stopped when our daughter was born 11yrs ago. She hasn't, I know where her stash is. If she's out, I put some down the toilet and top it up with anything powdery I can find. I put egg powder in last week. I dont think she notices."
"I tell colleagues that I have to be audio only in Zoom meetings because my camera's broken, but actually it's because I attend work meetings stark bollock naked."
I am lucky to be endowed with a large penis. One of my proudest moments was managing to put 78 pence under my foreskin in assorted change whist stood naked on the stage at the football club. Felt sorry for the barman when I paid for a round afterwards.
"I pirated the Oprah interview so I could watch it an hour earlier than broadcast and prep my social media jokes so that people would engage with me. What can I say, lockdown's been tough."
"When pissing, and getting a double stream, I pretend I'm a cobra spitting venom from my dick. Sometimes I even hiss aggressively"
"For a decade almost every Friday I had a chicken & lamb kebab, but since meeting my vegan eco girlfriend that has stopped. To the owners at the Istanbul Kebab House I am so sorry and I miss you more than you know. Why do we always hurt the ones we love most."
"I'm obsessed with reading about how old technology works so that if I'm ever teleported back in time i can invent it and become rich, I've never even built it's furniture but I'm convinced I can build a stream engine in bronze age"

"Ive always wanted to live in London but never did for one reason or another—and I probably never will. Last time I visited I found myself becoming jealous of the pigeons, living their best London lives with their cockney cooing."
"When i was a student living in Chiswick, on drunken nights walking home i used to buy an extra large doner so that when walking along the posh roads, i could put strips of doner meat under the windscreen wipers of posh cars. Porsches were my favourite."
"I leave cancelled meetings in my work calendar so it looks like I'm busier than I am, I watch a lot of YouTube."
"I frequently have to walk past my ex's kitchen window, and find myself lingering in the hope of glimpsing her. I know this strongly suggests I'm still in love with her, but the way she loads the dishwasher still pisses me off."
Everytime the pilot is in the middle of landing a plane I'm on I get scared that a higher power will make me switch bodies with him as a harsh lesson for sometimes wishing I could be someone else for a day
"We keep chickens. One of their favorite foods is whole roast chicken. Pecked clean to the bones in minutes. We get them free from the farmers program at the local supermarket. Yes, we are monsters. But it's better than throwing perfectly good food in the landfill."
I rented a flat on the 17th floor just so I could walk around naked. Now they're building an apartment across from mine and I'm going to move. I'd rather pay an extra $600 a month than give up being in my birthday suit whenever I'm at home.
"I hide money from my husband. He's wonderful but a spender, if I want to have any sort of emergency savings this is how I have to do it. I have $4k hidden in the house, and another 15k in investments. It's not a lot, but it's enough to bring me peace of mind- and it's growing."
When I worked in Pharmacy there was a guy who was a proper arse licker with management. so I decided to annoy him I'd ring the anonymous whistle blowing line and make up some story about him stealing meds. Turns out he actually was. Lost his job and got a suspended sentence.
"When I had just started work, I saw a bloke wearing a T-Shirt saying I came on Eileen. I thought it was so funny that I raised it over dinner with all the bosses and their other halves. Everyone smiled politely. This still haunts me to fuck, 20 years later."
"I've just been down to the tip to throw away an old suitcase so I pretended it was full of body parts. I pulled my hoodie over my head, acted as though the case was really heavy then chucked it into the container before speeding off."
I never let anyone turning into the local fee-paying school turn when waiting and I'm in traffic going the other way. The posh fuckers in their oversized SUVs can fucking wait.
"Sometimes I find my children so exasperating and energy-sapping that I want to die from a violent heart attack or aneurysm - in part for the tranquility of death, and in part to hopefully teach them an unforgettable life lesson about not being such relentless little shits."
"When there's a big news story, I like to rehearse what I would say about it should I be interviewed by a famous journalist. I try to sound sensitive to all the issues involved while expressing a firm opinion. Haven't been asked yet but you never know."
"While tidying up some old photos, I came across pictures of my nan in a bikini. It gave me a boner, so I quickly thrashed one out. I've felt shame ever since."
To remember my car number plate - which ends in MHC - I think of MHC=MY HAIRY COCK. I often have to mutter this under my breath when recalling it to a hotel receptionist etc.
"Every day during working from home, I have taken a photo of the bus that stops outside my house at about 9am. I now have over 350 pictures of a bus. Not sure why I've done this."

"I once installed Grindr on a work trip and was surprised to find my allegedly straight boss on there, less than 5m away. He was in the hotel room next door. An hour later I heard him quietly welcoming someone in. Alright Alan, you go get that conference cock."
"I once worked in a Canary Wharf skyscraper, our company had one floor and nearly all the other floors were a major bank. We weren't allowed to use their heavily subsidised canteen but I did every day. TAKE THAT BANKERS!"
When I'm out walking with my two year old daughter I encourage her to wave when buses go past. I am jubilant whenever the driver waves back. I'm 47.
Just had an acrimonious split from a client who has treated me poorly. I handle loads of their tech and have changed the password on every platform to 'isace' so they'll be forced to type it and remember it for ages. I know it will piss them off royally.
"Family funeral coming up. Person was an odd fucker who treated others poorly. Got no interest in mourning their death, but still gonna try and get few days compassionate off to catch up with Netflix"
"I put my cats out the room when I masturbate. I don't care what they think, I just wonder if we'll invent technology to clone our pets with their memories intact and I don't want a lab technician to see me watching pornography"
"Had a crafty wank after my wife got up, but I accidentally left the tissue on the floor. My dog must have came in and ate it, as before my eyes later that morning he puked it up over my father in laws feet, ruining his suede shoes"
"I shared a flat and one summer the bog broke. We were too tight to fix it so I used to shit in a carrier bag and stuff it in next doors bush on the way to work. When autumn came, the leaves dropped off the bush & left a glorious display of shit filled Tesco bags."
"Sometimes I will message my friends with something like It was wonderful last night, I can't wait to see you again suggesting to them I'm having a secret affair, but text them in error. To date not one of them has acknowledged receiving one of these messages."
When a TV show warns me it contains bad language I always swear it in gratitude. I don't know why. I am 47.
I used to steam open all of my parents' post. It started because I was trying to intercept a detention from school and carried on. If I went back I'd do it again.
"Going through files of my recently-deceased, elderly father-in-law with my wife, I opened a USB stick expecting to find family photos or finance docs. Instead we found an extensive, and surprisingly exotic porn collection. We can never speak of this again.Copied it all though."
A woman I worked with once mentioned in passing that green suited me. Thirty years later and I still wear predominantly green clothes.
"My boyfriend never does the laundry or any chores. Every time I empty his jean pockets before washing I pocket some of his change - okay - notes. Its not stealing, I call it payment towards all he does not do."
I've been a secret Man United fan all my life and no one knows
"Lockdown has made me bored of absolutely everything; music, films, podcasts, games, wanking, reading, and worried this ennui won't disappear when it ends"

Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something sexy to Will Smith?
"My dad thinks I've finally started following football and it means we've had some less awkward phone chats during Lockdown. What's actually happening is my wife's giving me talking points like that website in the IT crowd, but without the accent"
"Wired my Audi's headlights so I can make them alternate like an unmarked police car. If I'm stuck behind a slow car, they get a little taste of the lights and always get out the way."
At uni saw a Le Creuset pot been left by the bins. Went to collect- score! Though it contained yellow cheesy vomit most likely from the DJ who lived above our flat who had late parties. Cleaned it up and have cooked many nice dishes in it for people over the years.
When I was doing my GCSEs I realised that some of my teachers had really weak and easy to guess passwords. I was able to access any students saved documents which saved me a lot of time and effort on my coursework. I made sure I used the clever ones that would be A grade material
"I worked night shift for a big newspaper. We'd get all kinds of misfits ring up at night. If someone gave me the shits earlier in the shift, I'd tell the nutters sounds like a great story. Ring back tomorrow and ask for ."
"Used to bruise easily as a kid which led to my dad becoming 100% convinced I was being bullied / kicked about at school. It was nothing, but nobody believed me. Teachers were convinced too. Had to pick out a perpetrator to shut them all up. Did it at random. Kid was expelled."
My mate had car radio OCD. It was bad luck for the volume to be on an odd number - even when off. To 'prove him wrong' I changed it from 20 to 19 while he paid for petrol. 10 minutes later he scraped the wall in an NCP. I changed it back when he got out and never told him.
I once received a record player as a birthday present. People buy me records as presents. I am way to busy to use it and the speakers are shite. I can't do anything about it and will continue to receive records as presents for years to come.
"Despite being 50, whenever I'm in a shopping centre or big supermarket I will always go and browse the toys - Lego, action figures etc. People might think I'm looking for something for my children, but they have both grown up and left home. I do it purely for myself."
I tried to get the cat to nosh me off by smearing my bell with cat food. Blood feline wasn't interested and my dick just smelt of Whiskas for days
"I work as a cleaner. Whenever I find wifi scales I stand on them with as much heavy equipment as I can hold, in the hope it will register as an unexpected wieght gain in their app and trigger a panic diet."
"Whenever the family has a roast dinner I make a big show of sharpening the carving knife before serving up. I have no idea what I'm doing and probably make it a bit worse every time. I get it done professionally from time to time, on the quiet."
We once conned a restaurant into giving us a free meal by pretending the Asian woman in our group was the violinist Vanessa Mae. They still have the photo up on the wall 20 years later.
After my divorce I started seeing a girl who would send me nudes to cheer me up each time Arsenal lost. She was really really hot so I just kept telling her they lost even when they won or even if they didn't play.
My wife gives me two handed handjobs. I don't know if I'm big enough to justify it but it makes me feels like a god.

My wife and I have been keeping a secret stash of biscuits hidden from our children. What she doesn't know is I have a double secret stash of even better biscuits all for me.
"When I was into criminal activities in the 90s, I burnt all my fingerprints off my fingers. if I knew I would need fingerprint unlock for phones in the future I would of never had bothered."
I wear Christmas socks all year round.
"Circa 2000, if you were suddenly deluged with all manner of postal spam and shite, you had probably phoned our call centre and were spectacularly rude. We did this to dozens of dicks and every one of them deserved it."
I've been happily married for over 20 years but recently my wife has taken to using both hands when she eats anything with her fingers. Like a fucking Hamster. If anything does for us it'll be that.
The guitar I purchased in lockdown with good intent to learn to play didn't cost the £175 I told my wife. It actually cost £499. I've picked it up once.
"I love Nigella and my partner wanted to surprise me and made her muffins. For me, I usually halve the sugar but since he'd never baked before, he followed the recipe to the letter. I still don't have the guts to the him that they were so sickly sweet that I hated them."
"I never wash my hands after using the bathroom. My wife has got wise to this and listens outside the door. So I turn on the tap, wet the soap and rearrange the towel after pooing in order to cover my tracks. This takes longer than washing my hands, but I refuse to let her win."
"I work for myself but I made up names and positions for my several business email accounts and communicate with my clients pretending to be Claire the CS Officer and Jake the Finance guy. I'm not the only sole trader doing this, am I?"
"It is taking every ounce of willpower I have not to contact all my exes out of pure lockdown boredom, I'm even not drinking to avoid caving in"
I sell my worn french knickers and thongs to grotty men online and earn a decent living from it. I'm a 39yo man. Not a 25yo woman called Jessica
"In '95 after high school I moved in with my boyfriend. '09, we married. '17 he passed away unexpectedly. At age 44, I'm just learning who I am as an individual. Sometimes this new person fills me with absolute joy. Usually she terrifies me."
"Given the number of Fesses about people living alone who pretend to talk to others in the house when the pizza delivery arrives in order to appear less greedy, I don't do this anymore because I'm now convinced all delivery drivers know this lamentable deceit."
Just took off my bra. My boobs smell like salt and vinegar crisps. I'm equal parts disgusted and peckish.
I eat an apple every morning..I then put the core on top of the drivers side windscreen wiper and wait for idiots who drive up my arse to overtake me .. as they do I activate the aforementioned wipers in the hope of hitting the prick overtaking me .. I have a success rate of 76%
"If you think the lesbian scene is all joy, harmony and sisterhood versus 'the Man', think again. It's incredibly competitive, bitchy and riddled with deceit. Sex, which is impossible not to find, is absolutely mind-blowing though."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something illegal with a hedgehog?
"I have no idea if it's acceptable to eat a 12 pizza on my own, or if I'm only supposed to have 3 or 4 slices, then the rest the next day. I don't know what other people do and I'm too embarrassed to ask. Is this normal or am I a greedy fuck?"
"Once when I was young and left at home alone with nothing to do, I started looking for silly names in the phone book. I'd like to apologise to Mr Smellie of the Bridport area for any annoyance this may have caused."
"I spent far too much of my youth listening to shit music. Iron maiden, motley crue.....can't help thinking I would have had sex so many more times if I hadn't."
I've been a practising lawyer now for 12 years. I still don't really understand what 'beyond all reasonable doubt' actually means.
Lockdown has resulted in so many meetings I basically power down between them and stare into space. I do my actual work at night. It's fucking shit.
"I write obscure academic articles and publish them in niche scientific journals. Hardly anyone ever reads them, but I often re-read them, just for fun. I think they're fucking brilliant. I'm prouder of them than I am my three children."
My partner has done virtual weigh-ins in lockdown. Lost 2 stone. Except they looks the same and still eats loads of junk. The week they go back to weighing in the church hall will be interesting.
"I've been using the same completed coffee token to get cappuccinos at the McDonalds Drive Thru for the last 6 months. They never ask you for it on the next window, 100% record."
"I love wearing my mask, I hope it never stops. I'm not much of a looker but thanks to my long blonde hair and curvy figure I now get the odd admiring glance. This is what it must feel like to be pretty."
"Just after giving a date a blowjob whilst parked in a quiet lay-by in Rothbury, a random man appeared from the tree line, saw us and ran off. Next day the Raoul Moat manhunt was all over the news and we were told to stay indoors. I'm convinced it was Gazza."
"Summertime when I was 15, tidying a drawer and found a Xmas cracker hat. Put it on, forgot about it. Was out all day running errands, going to the shops, picking stuff up etc. Didn't realise I still had the hat on until I got home and looked in the mirror. Mortified."
"We used to steal crates of beer from the supermarket by carrying them past the checkout as though we were going to pay at the cigarette counter, then buying cigarettes and acting like we had already paid for the beer. Only did it a few times before I ran out of nerve."
"I can't go to sleep until I've checked my kids are safe, no pillows may fall on them etc. They're 12, 14 and 17. University is going to be hell or a lot of driving"
I told my wife I enjoy hearing her singing during the day when we work from home. Now she sings loudly all day and I regret saying anything.
"Guys, hardcore porn will ruin your sex life. I've wanked over everything from feet to trans to cuckolds. Once everthing turned me on, now nothing. My wife is left bored and unsatisfied. Take my advice, stop watching porn."
Sometimes I wish something bad would happen to me to justify why I feel so sad
"When having sex with my beautiful wife I often think of Margaret Thatcher to stop myself jizzing too early. Sometimes it works, but not always. I've lost count of how many times I've spunked whilst thinking of Maggie."
"Stop giving horses those sexy haircuts that makes them look human. You know the ones, with the hair over the eyes. It's confusing."
Our home school parents WhatsApp group has been a revelation as to how stupid some people are. Today someone asked for help finding the UK on a world map.
The worst thing about working from home is having to make small talk with your cleaner
"When I was younger, I told someone I didn't like Deee-Lite's Groove is in the Heart, because the bassist was trying too hard to copy Bootsy Collins. I just read the bassist was Bootsy Collins."
"Whenever I pull over in my car to let an emergency vehicle pass through, I feel like a bloody hero"
"Greg Wallace did a programme on how toilet rolls were made. I never realised there's a smooth side and a rough side. For years I've been wiping my arse with the P80 grit side. I daren't tell my family, let alone my poor arse."
I once met a boy at a bar and to get him to sleep with me I lied and said I had 6 months to live. I felt awful but the pitty sex was incredible.
Guy I slept with had a strange shaped nob. Wider at the base. Like a parsnip. 4 inches. Never got the chance to see it in daylight because he ditched me soon after. Liked him though. I hope he found someone who appreciates the parsnip.
"During my 38th year I found out that sheep & goats are separate species, until then I always thought a goat was a male sheep."
"I've been running my own business for 8 years now, and the whole time I've run it on the principles of the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition from Star Trek."
Someone on the night shift kept eating my food out of the work fridge. After cleaning the hair and congealed gunk out of the shower plughole I put it into a ham and cheese roll and left it in the fridge. Found it half-eaten and stuffed in the bin the next day. Result!
"Sometimes when I'm standing on the bus, I let go of the pole and pretend the bus is a giant skateboard that I'm steering as it turns a corner"
"I had a major heart attack last year at quite a young age, and discovered that I couldn't care less if I lived or died. That knowledge has made my shit life more bearable"
I wonder if the girls I had amazing one night stands with reminisce about our shags as often as me.
"Back in the 90s when house parties were a regular thing, I would always find the fridge, take a bite out their block of cheddar cheese and put it back in the fridge."
"On Facebook, I often snooze people off my timeline for 30 days if they post shit like motivational quotes, excessive baby pictures, brexit style gammon, etc. The minor sense of power in applying these suspensions is wonderful."
I throw an imaginary hand grenade under the bed each morning before I get up to kill off the imaginary monsters under it. I don't put my feet over the edge until after it's gone off. No point in starting the day with shrapnel in your ankle.
Up until very recently I thought a wedding breakfast was just breakfast the morning after a wedding.
"I genuinely believed that all married couples descend into mutual loathing and hate, until I worked with a large group of women and discovered that a lot of them still love their partners, even after many years. I now realise my marriage is wrong and happiness is still possible."
I was talking to the staff at a recording studio where lots of famous people go. Who was the worst most demanding person you've had the misfortune to work with here? I asked. All 5 staff instantly replied in perfect synchronisation: Cilla Black
"I'm in my late 20s, I have a successful marketing career but spend everyday fearing I'm going to be working for the rest of my life always making someone else's dreams come true just to make a living and it puts the fear of life in me. Internally I am screaming daily."
I eat Dolmio's bolognaise sauce cold from the jar. I am a uni student and consider 3-4 tablespoons an adequate dinner
I always thought anal sex wasn't too painful judging by the monstrous dicks & petit ladies in porn. Then my girlfriend pegged me with a very small strap-on dildo. Those pornstars deserve footballers wages.
"When I was 12 I was on a ferry back to Glasgow from Uist in the summer of 2004, I stole a kid's WWE figure by lying that I'd stop by his house and give him £5 for it. He even gave me directions to his home in the highlands. I often wonder when he realised that I wasn't coming"
Whenever I'm feeling down I watch Ed Balls dancing to Gangnam Style on YouTube. It never fails to make me smile.
I recently bought a toilet light from Amazon. When customer services asked me if I left a bad review I used this as an opportunity to reply with a photo of a gloriously illuminated turd. They thanked me for my response.
"I run a lot, up to 50 or 60 miles a week, and take it pretty seriously...but whenever I fart on a run I still pretend it's like a Knight Rider style turbo boost and put on a little sprint. I am 45 this year."
My neighbours have recently sound-proofed their son's bedroom because my TV is too loud in the morning. I told them its loud because I'm partly deaf but its really because the volume is stuck and I can't be arsed buying a new TV
Staying at my friends house who never bought in toilet roll has given me an irrational phobia of sleeping at peoples houses now. I'd rather pay £120 for a hotel room for myself than stay at a friends house just in case there's no bog roll.
I'd love to tell ALL of my LinkedIn connections to get fucked.
"Bought mango iced tea drink some years back. Mango content - 0.1%. Pissed me off. Wrote to company demanding fresh mango as compensation. An email a week for six months, increasingly florid in my prose. "
"Couriered me 1 fresh mango and a t-shirt. Fight the fight, people!"
"My Mrs is a genuine 10/10, looks and personality, and I am at best a 6/7. It's been 3 years and it still amazes me. Cannot figure out if I'm exceptionally funny and interesting or I'm a sensational shag. It's got to be one of them, I'm skint."
"I truly believe my life is scripted and being filmed for a TV show a la Truman Show. Because of this, I make jokes to myself so at least it's a sitcom and not a scandi depressing drama"
"When I was a first year student living in halls, I had no friends and it used to piss me off so much listening to other people having parties that I would frequently call the security guards and report them to get the parties broken up."

I have never been able to come from recieving a blowjob. I want to. I just never have.
"I turn a little imaginary tap on the side of my knob to start pissing then slowly turn it off during the last drops, no idea why but can't stop doing it"
"When I go for a long bike ride, my average-sized dick shrivels up. I'm terrified i'll crash and my clothes will need cutting off, leaving me displaying my button mushroom to the world. I nurture it back to normal flaccid size as soon as I get home."
A few years ago an annoying woman was in the queue behind me in Costa. I deliberately chose the cake that she wanted as it was the last one. Revenge is best served as a cake.
"After a brief frisson of excitement, I've come to the sad realisation that the end of lockdown won't affect me. Now I'm single, I won't be going out to pubs, restaurants or cafes. I'll still be binge watching Netflix on my own and ordering deliveroos."
"Lads, the reason I don't post much to our WhatsApp group is because you are all a bunch of cunts. I wish I realised this 30 years ago."
"When I was a teen and couldn't be arsed to go get some bog roll, I wanked into an empty After Eight wrapper and then fell asleep. Woke up and my step-mum had tidied up all around me. No wrappers in sight."
"I'm sorry, Simon, for pissing on your Vauxhall Chevette. Nothing against you, it was because I used to really hate Vauxhall Chevettes."
Told myself that entering my 40s doesn't mean I'm almost dead. Just gave an extra hard squeeze while taking a dump and popped my back out.
I share the name with a known killer with a court ruling against him that means they go to jail if they ever take a job in that sector again. When I applied for a job in that industry I was surprised to get an interview - they only offered me the interview to check I wasn't them.
"I proposed to my wife whilst very pissed in my early 20s. For reasons I don't understand I never backed out although I knew I should have. In my late 40s now, 2 kids and I hope reincarnation is real so I can have a better go next time."
Why did nobody tell me about baths? Not because I am not clean but I just spent 90 minutes in the bath and my family left me to it. I might start doing it every night for the peace and quiet.
"I got into med school in 2013 so I could get close to a girl I wanted to sleep with. I never slept with her. Anyway, I'm a doctor now."
Coco Pops had a game in 2002 to try and find Coco the Monkey from the clues on the box. I wrote a letter saying he could be found in the Animal House at Huntington Life Sciences. I never heard back if I won.
I always split open multipacks in my local Tesco and take one item from it and hide it in another aisle. Look forward to going back the following day to find the same multipack in the discount section usually at 30% - 50% off which means I can now afford to buy it.
"A few years ago I was at a student house party totally off my tits on JDs and shrooms. Apparently, I announced to a crowded kitchen that I could pee like a man. I unzipped my jeans, pulled out my imaginary penis, and pissed in my pants. I only have vague memories of that night."

My mother was dying of cancer. I sat by her bed every day plucking up the courage to smother her with a pillow. I got so close one morning whilst she slept. It's my biggest regret in life that I didn't do it.
When my husband takes the kids out for an hour I pull together a basket of half sorted laundry. That way when I hear the driveway gravel crunch signalling their return I can promptly look like I'm halfway through sorting the washing rather than having just finished masturbating.
My girlfriend has a heart of gold and very planet conscious. She doesn't like me using foil for my work lunches due to the impact it has on the planet. She bought me re-usable and washable sandwich bags. I hate them and pretend I use them...I still use foil. Lots. Love it.
"Under lockdown I'm never without either wife or kids within 10ft of me. I've resorted to driving to my empty office to check the post twice a week, but really it's so I can crack one out in the toilet cubicle in peace."
"Aged 14, I would let off stink bomb capsules in the family bathroom to disguise wanking sessions as poos. They were putrid. My mum took me to our GP. I ended getting a colonoscopy."
"Used to get the train to work and had irrational hatreds of other passengers. One had a small mouth, another was a spit of a mate but it was the Ian Beale lookalike I despised the most. Used to deliberately sit in his fave seat just to piss him off."
"When I was young my parents wouldn't let me get down from the dining table unless I had eaten all of my dinner as it would make me grow up big and strong.. I am now a 28 stone man who gets out of breath walking to the fridge and back, not sure it's what my parents meant"
"A new neighbour across the road from me looks like Mario, he parks his Yaris high on the curb leaving people to struggle to get passed. We have started leaving banana skins on it and near it and are desperately looking for turtle shells to place next to it.."
"Sometimes I open the Uber app just to see if any are driving along my street. I don't book trips, I just watch them go past on the screen"
A fesshole about the old school bully led me to check out mine hoping for news of something shit. He's just been awarded an MBE for 50 years of frying fish.
"I got a software dev contract with a company, but I'm only an average coder, so I post the work on Freelancer. The daily rate of a developer in Calcutta is much lower than mine, even if I add on a healthy tip. Everyone's a winner."
"I once stood at a urinal, forgot to take my cock out my trousers and pissed down my leg. I then accused a random bloke of spilling a pint down my leg to start a shoving match to ensure I was thrown out of said club as an excuse to go home and get out of my pissy trousers."
"I'm a tough, muscular, straight man who loves UFC, West Ham and drinking Stella, but I wanna be a Karen. It would be wonderful drinking Prosecco, going with my friends to Take That reunion gigs and yelling Live Laugh Love all the time like wailing banshees with stubbed toes."
Whenever the mrs wants to get down and dirty I have to shower with some fruity scented shower gel as my usual bar of Imperial Leather makes my knob smell like her nan.
"My son wanted to use his pocket money for some new headphones. I paid for it on my card and kept the cash as I was buying other stuff. Instead of paying £20 for them they charged me £1. As you can guess, I pocketed the £19! Please forgive 🙏🏻"
"At the weekend I make my dog scrambled eggs for breakfast, she likes them on the soft side with a few shavings of Parmesan . I save the smoked salmon for myself , don't want to spoil her ..."
"I eat jam from the jar, spoonful after spoonful whilst watching TV. No shame at all and yes I live alone"
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something nasty with a tarmac road?
"When I wake up hungover, I can't wait to pick my nose, the fact I'm dehydrated means my bogeys are extra big and crunchy, like sweet green morning treats"
"My neighbour has moved into his mistresses home and turned his house into an Airbnb to for extra income; I am friends with his ex-wife so I write terrible reviews on booking dot com, his home has sat empty for the last 3 months."
"Me and my mates on the way back from a night out discovered a set of cricket gnomes, including stumps, in someone's garden. We set them up on the main road in legitimate fielding positions with other gnomes as the crowd. Massive traffic jam the next morning."
"My boyfriend sends me Fesshole tweets on the daily asking is this you? I barely see him as he's reclused to the spare room through lockdown. So yeah Luke, this one is for you xo"
Since lockdown I've come to regard my mobile phone as just a phone.
"I'm in my late thirties. Years of alcohol, drugs, & bad food in a vicious cycle with depression, has had such an impact on my physical health, that I got offered the covid vaccine long before my parents who are in their 60s. Incredibly ashamed of this."
"I had a work enemy for 13 years. He was vile and I left 2 years ago. I left him a trap that paid off yesterday. He took credit for work I made up before I left in 2019 and he is now short 50,000 units. The company boast about this made up customer on their website!"
Every time someone has a birthday or is leaving in the office when they wheel the cake out I have to hold myself back from lunging forward and smashing my face into it. It's a really strong compulsion
My nerdy D&D friends would be very amused to learn that my cool booze and drugs friends also refer to themselves as The Fellowship
I've been trying to persuade the other half that we need a 4k TV as our HD one was looking a little fuzzy compared to newer models. They finally caved and £1k later we have a new TV. Next day optician told me I need glasses. This may explain a few things....
"I have never watched a programme all the way through on Channel 5, and I never plan to either."
I once ate a whole block of blue cheese in one sitting and shat black tar the next day. Worth it.
"I was learning to drive in an old mini van, so my hubby took me to the private roads around an old mental hospital. It was very poorly lit. The mini went down 6 concrete steps and landed on a lawn. Later, the local paper said the bowling green had been vandalized. Sorry."
"Co-founders are for life, not just starting up. Fucking hate mine, wish I'd been more promiscuous when choosing :/"
"I'm in a WhatsApp group with my old uni mates and some other lads where we brag about the fine wines, cocktails, and fancy beers we all copiously consume. But I'm actually not that big a drinker any more, and most of what I post is lies."
The kitchen tap's been leaking for well over a year. What started as a drip has turned into a pretty constant stream. Somebody should probably do something about that.
"When I take a gherkin from the jar, I tenderly lick and suck it like I am giving a blowjob to a knobbly alien penis. I am 100% straight."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something nasty to Steve Strange?
"I buy fresh veg in tesco so the person on the checkout doesn't think I'm just a fat cunt who only eats junk food. The veg sits in my cupboard and rots, then I bin it"
"I'm a ferry trip as a young teen I threw a message in a bottle overboard, as was the style of the time. A father and daughter showed up at my door months later with it. It was awkward and underwhelming. We never spoke again."
"I don't believe in any kind of god, aliens, ghosts or star-signs, but I do believe that if I don't put the correct socks and football top on, then it's my fault that they lose."
"Last night I flobbed into the bog and it hit my gut on the way down. I can still see my willy though, so it's all good."
"As a family therapist and someone whose mom and dad stayed together for the kids, I implore you not to do this. Living with two utterly miserable parents is far more damaging than shuttling between two happier ones. No need to play the martyr at all."
"Last week I stole a packet of paracetamol in Lidl because the stupid self-checkout weighing scale wouldn't recognise it, there was nobody about to help, so I just chucked it in the bag and left. Take that Lidl."
I'm a mortgage advisor and I don't understand about 50% of mortgage terminology and processes. I often have to google basic stuff.
I once ejaculated my kidney stones and my girlfriend ate it and called it crunchy nut
"I wiggle my fingers in a magical fashion at my computer screen while I'm waiting for a web page to load, as if I'm some sort of hack-sorcerer sticking it to Arthur C Clarke. In truth, I bore easily."
My brother got married 2+ years ago and since then I barely see him. I miss him and all the things we used to do together so much that I frequently cry about it. I never appreciated the relationship we had until it was gone
"When my partner has squirted blue toilet duck or similar products down the toilet bowl, I without fail make it my mission to remove it by pissing it all away as soon as possible......."
"When I'm repairing my sons ripped story books with pritt stick, I pretend I'm a master craftsman restoring something really valuable. It's the little things."
I was once on a flight and the guy sitting in front of me dropped a packet of cigarettes. I felt no guilt in taking them because I heard him use the abbreviation deets in conversation. His look of desperation when he couldn't find them was priceless.
"If I click a link on social media, then decide I want to share the article, I will clean up the URL first by removing everything after the question mark. Gives me a little smile to know the site won't know where the traffic is coming from."
"When lying on my side in bed, I'll often tuck the corner of the duvet in between my boobs so the upper one has more support, like a special little boob pillow. Only works when you're facing the outer edge of the duvet, so only my left boob gets this preferential treatment."
"I've needed a plumber to repair a few things in lockdown. He's a rather sweet, slender older man, with kind eyes. I've been in near complete isolation for 11.5 months and it's taking every ounce of self control I have not to tear his clothes off and ravage him on my bed"
I watch the all the credits after a film or TV programme because I want to acknowledge the hundreds of people who are involved in the production. I've annoyed dates with this and they think I'm being over-sincere. I'm still single.

When I was 18 I read that if you soaked a tampon in vodka and put it in that the alcohol would absorb quickly through your vagina. I kept it up there for ages even though my whole fanny was on bloody fire. Didn't even work
"I sent my name to Mars on Perseverance, but couldn't stand the thought of eternity with my husband up there, so I added the names of the two sexiest men I know, to keep me company."
"Every day during my morning dump I log on to Mail Online, find the article that most readers are losing their shit over, and post a massively inflammatory comment. Within an hour my inbox is filled with angry comments from triggered gammons. Brings joy to my otherwise dull days."
"I'm a 40 yr old dad and respectable Uni Professor. Not a big raver or drug taker but when this pandemic is over, I'm going to get off my fucking tits on a big illegal rave coke/E/acid bender. It's the only thing keeping me going at present."
"I got my mate sectioned and they have no idea it was me. I'm never telling them, because they'll never forgive me for saving them from their terrifying psychotic episode."
"I once had to explain at distressing length to an older female co-worker, in front of the office, that I did not in fact have kids I needed to drop off at the pool."
"This winter a Robin made a nest somewhere inside the large warehouse where I work. My boss gets called out multiple times every weekend because it sets off the buglar alarm. Ever since we found this out, the rest of us have been leaving biscuit crumbs out to encourage it to stay."
"I was scared of getting a real job, but now I've realised you can just do an impression of someone who knows what they're doing and thats kind of good enough to not get you sacked."
"If I lived alone, I would merely eat soup 3x a day and supplement with fruit and vegetables and a little dairy for nutritional purposes. Sadly, other people in this house prefer proper meals with plenty of variety, so my soupy dream is unfulfilled"
I enjoy having cbeebies on as background noise. I don't have any children.
"If people saw my Internet search history they'd be shocked, not because I'm a massive perv case or anything, but because it's nothing but my geeky boring odd obsessions. Last night I read the Cobb Salad wiki and watched a vid of the BBC's 1987 election coverage."
"Since lockdown started, I've been making around £500 per month with an OnlyFans account that is just photos and videos of me taking a shit. I never thought people would pay to see turds easing their way out my bumhole, but they do. Disgusting really."
My next door neighbours moved out three weeks ago and I really miss them. Not the people. They were arseholes. The two cats they had were lovely and came to visit every day since lockdown started.
Since lockdown started and true boredom set in I've been saving all the fluff that finds its way to my belly button in antique jewelery box my grandparents for some reason left me. Plan to give it to my daughter on her wedding day. I'm delighted to finally have found a use for it
I once left a pair of cheap sunglasses on a plane. I realised a few minutes later and went back to see if they had found them. They showed me a pair of expensive looking Ray Bans and asked if they were mine. Of course I accepted.
Once met Noel Edmonds and told him Mr Blobby was the worst thing ever let loose on the world. He told me I was a miserable bastard.

Noisy neighbours recently built an ugly metal shed in their back garden which we have to stare at all day. Have reported it to a council planning officer who reckons they will get a £5000 fine and ordered to dismantle it. Soz guys!
"My partner doesn't know I have an app that allows me to 'pause' our wifi so I regularly use it when he pisses me off, to prevent him staring at his phone all day or playing PS5 games. Ironically our wifi service is usually impeccable."
"At work I'm supposed to upload all my designs to a global archive site, tag them with important copyright info etc. I've never done it in the 5 years I've been an employee so it can't be that important."
"I once claimed £68 back under the Premier Inn 'Good Night Sleep Guarantee' because I didn't get a good night's sleep, largely because I stayed up watching porn and wanking all night."
As a student I spent the summer of 2012 in the 'Wenlock' mascot costume. I'll let you into a secret - there were about 20 costumes and Wenlock could be in multiple locations at any one time.
"Nobody else at works understands our website analytics so I just tell them we get shit loads of new daily visitors to the site since I commissioned a v expensive redesign last year - we don't, we get loads less."
"I work at the call centre for a major airline and will randomly allocate loyalty points to people who are nice to me on the phone. A nice lady who's dad had died recently got enough points for a first class flight to NYC, I just put the reason down as 'customer retention'."
There's been a sheet of about 100 first class stamps in the receptionist's desk at work for years since we got a franking machine. Tomorrow I am going to steal them.
"Worked in a bakery packing & filling donuts in pre-priced packages for M&S, Asda, Co-Op etc. Cheapest donuts were Asda that got three squirts of jam. M&S cost 35p more per pack and got half a squirt at best. Always took pleasure knowing that M&S customers were being cheated!"
"I'm a security guard and I have so much CCTV on my phone in my WhatsApp group chats of customers making an arse of themselves. Tripping, falling, colliding heads, instant karma. The job truly is what you make it and I love mine!"
I work for Tesco and whenever an arsehole customer sends in some anonymous petty complaint about me daring to have a laugh at work I counter it with about 4 good comments and end up getting a reward for my efforts.
"Step mum is my coke dealer's name on my phone. Girlfriend knows we have a difficult relationship which means when she calls I need to step out the room, to talk in private."
"Lockdown has given me a new perspective on working from home and my teenagers. They're bone-idle, crap-eating, shite-talking parasites that stare at their phones all day. I'm desperate to get back to the office to escape the Living Dead."
"In Rollercoaster Tycoon I put water at the exits of my rides and pretend that the guests are landlords, making a sort of Mao Zedong-esque theme park."
"Had a petty argument with my girlfriend and walked out of her house hoping she'd follow, now she's gone, won't talk to me and I'm 44 and now destined for a life of loneliness and darkness. She was fucking amazing and I'm a piece of shit."
Accidentally liked one of Noel Gallagher's hot daughter's saucy posts on Instagram and now I'm worried her dad's going to come and fuck me up.

"Have been on furlough since last March, and got myself a nice side hustle doing Deliveroo. Coming out of lockdown, slimmer, fitter & richer thanks to cycling fags, booze & chocolate to all you fat lazy fucks."
"As a child I used to think the watershed was a really filthy 9pm programme I wasn't allowed to watch. I was disappointed to find out it wasn't real, but was eventully rewarded with Eurotrash."
I have just helped the wife make a pie. While she was on the phone I carved a cock and balls into the top and popped it into the oven.
"Sometimes when I'm in the car alone I like to scream as loudly as I can, sometimes for prolonged periods. It's very cathartic, and not something I can get away with doing at home even though I often feel the urge."
"Mr Eden, I was one of the group who, in 1985, wheeled your sailing boat from your house, along the road and onto the school cricket pitch where we left it for everyone to see on the last day of that year. We became legends overnight. You were a bastard to me. Not sorry."
"As we age, my husband looks like Chris Evans - not the ginger one - and I like Miriam Margolyes so I spend every day wondering if he is going to leave me. But for now, he's still mine so hands off, bitches."
I am a boring person who has manufactured a personality purely on peep show quotes. Mistakenly watched it with my missus who now thinks she doesn't know me at all.

"My boyfriend's pubes get everywhere so when I find them, I've started putting them on his pillow."
"A lot of people smoke weed around where I live. If I take a one hour walk around town I find enough half- smoked joints to harvest a day's smoking. It's disgusting and I hate myself for it. However, I sometimes find whole baggies full. Or ecstasy or cocaine. Or diseases, probably"

"My husband has a low sperm count, we tried to have kids for three years. His brother doesn't have this issue. I now have two beautiful kids and we've been fucking twice a month behind both our spouses backs for the last 4 years. I love my husband but I have no regrets."
At the theatre years ago I ended up going to the toilet just after Jonathan Ross of all people. He hadn't flushed. I took a photo of his leavings and still show it to friends to add veracity to my anecdote but none of them believe me

"Everytime I see Aloe vera, I say 'Hello Vera' in an old woman's voice as if I've just bumped into my friend Vera."
"I never disable my adblocker when I'm on The Independent's website. Instead I just read the story through the tiny, two-line slit above the pop-up."
"At school in the 1980s there was always a group of kids breakdancing on a big sheet of cardboard. When break ended, we went and picked up the money that had fallen out of their pockets. I got £8 one day."
"I write down the details of every turd I lay in an Excel spreadsheet. Approximate size, consistency, effort required to squeeze out, colour, smell, etc. I've been doing this for nearly a decade and am not really sure what to do with all this data."

"I don't use my garden in the winter and often can't be bothered to pick up the dog shit, so I wait until the temperature drops below zero and take my 9 iron and blast it over the neighbours gardens"
I've put on so much weight during lockdown that Face ID no longer recognises my jowly ruin.
"I always make tea at work by filling a mug with hot water, then adding milk, then adding the tea bag and stirring vigorously for 20 seconds.Everyone hates that I do it that way so people make me brews out of sympathy and refuse one when I offer to make them one."
I've spent a significant portion of my life trying to use the force to move common household objects.
I have taken to yawning in front of my dog to see if he copies me. 80% of the time he does. I feel like I am the dog whisperer
"I used my electric toothbrush to clean all around the sink taps and other places, it does a wonderful job."
"I rinse it afterwards to that's fine, right?"
"My wife is a life long vegetarian. I let her raise our daughters the same way because I knew that would mean nobody touches my food. It's been going great so far, for 11 years!"
"On Celebrity Big Brother in 2010, Basshunter used a bowl and whipped cream to show off his oral sex technique. He now pops into my head every time I go down on a girl, but my god does the technique work an absolute treat."
After an operation on my hand I wasn't allowed to wash it for weeks and couldn't be bothered to use wipes. Eventually a thick grey film developed across my whole hand. It was utterly disgusting but I'm sad that I'll likely never get the opportunity to allow it to happen again.
Had a fucking awful landlord who wanted the rent paid in cash every month. We lived there for close to 10 years. When we eventually left he refused to give back our deposits. So I left it a couple of months and then shopped him to the taxman.
When I was a kid I had a fight with an older kid and managed to roll his head through a massive pile of dog shit! I can still clearly remember doing my victory walk past his house and his old man hosing his head down and simultaneously smacking his arse.
"I keep a stash of best butter in the house for my toast while the rest of the family are stuck with a supermarket own brand margarine, the kids don't savour it so why should they get it?"
"Me: I've really got to stop wanking every day, I'm wearing it down to a stub. Also me: Great, she's walking the dog, that gives me at least 30 minutes."
"I once spent my own money to travel from London to Amsterdam to see James Blunt in concert. He was actually really good, and I'm a fan of his music. There, I said it and I'm not clinically insane."
"My old company bought everything - desks, chairs, laptops - secondhand off eBay because they're tight. I linked my Nectar card to their eBay account when I started around 5 years ago. They've paid for roughly 20% of my groceries since. I don't even work there any more."
"I trained as a teacher coz my salary has never been much over min wage. I only wanted the money, thought I'd be shit at it, but survive for a few years before being found out. More fool me, the last 2 years have been the best of my life, love the kids, and I am doing really well."
"I work for a chain restaurant, prior to the first lockdown I could easily scam £60-£100 per day from the company with customers who paid in cash. Made around 12k in 2 years. We are now card payments only. Fucking distraught"

Since the first lockdown my mates and I have enjoyed online get-togethers where we drink cans and play chess. I use a move calculator and trounce them everytime. They now think I'm some sort of freak. I regret not just owning up to the fact I don't even know the rules of chess.
I remember when I was young farting into an empty Quality Street tin and being really disappointed when my sister opened it that it didn't make the sound.
Since I hit 40 I've gone from 'Netflix and chill' to 'Netflix and bowlful of uncooked cake mix'.
"Reluctantly went with the fancy dress theme on a buntlins stag weekender. Put a load off effort in and went as Albert Einstein, unfortunately a small majority of revellers mistook me for Joseph Fritzel. friends, family and some casual associates now address me as Fritz"
I once found a porn DVD in my Dad's work bag. I did what any teenager would do: said nothing and copied it to a blank DVD when he was out. Hope he showed the same discretion when he found my stash after I moved out.
"My boyfriend has an abnormal phobia of sweetcorn, and every time I have a chicken Pot Noodle I put a little piece of sweetcorn underneath his pillow when he's not looking."
"As a teenager, I used to put on condoms when I fucked the hole between the legs of an oversized stuffed panda teddy bear. I only did that, as the first time I did, I got the panda's stuffing all over my cock"
"I am a relatively large youtuber and twitch streamer, and I make all of my video thumbnails using a free photoshop alternative I found online"
"If I ever piss on the seat at anyone's house, I wipe it off with my foot and tread it around their house"
"To all the people I said we must get together for a beer / coffee / meal when this is all over to, I lied"
I bought a Kindle Fire in lockdown. Thought I'd read all the classic novels I'd failed to during the previous 40 years of my life. Instead I spend all of my time watching porn and playing Candy Crush.
"Our local notice board has become obsessed with the 'dickhead cyclist' who doesn't ring his bell when passing from behind on the prominade. It's me, fuck them and fuck the bell."
I really enjoy extracting hair from plug holes with a pair of tweezers. It's so satisfying when you grab hold of just 1 hair and eventually a massive congealed clump of matted hair and gunk appears. Hoover bags too. But not if they're too dusty.
Thank you Paul McCarthy. You were always our favourite Beathle. https://t.co/z5BUxYxvnL
Should this pandemic ever blow over I will continue wearing face coverings. I'm having way too much fun with my inner ninja to stop now. 🥷
"My brother thinks I call his son Ray because he is a little ray of sunshine but actually it's because when he was born, he looked like Ray Reardon. He is 4 now and still has a look of him."
Slightly jealous of my single childless friends that get to spend lockdown drinking cans and playing ps4
I'm fat and worried I was pre-diabetic so bought a glucose monitor. Turns out I'm far from it so currently spooning chocolate spread onto Ritz crackers.

I am currently pissed and have just ordered a load of 'fun and quirky' things for our flat. Can't wait until delivery and having to explain some stuff to my husband.
Since lockdown we've had to buy a can crusher to hide the sheer volume of cans we drink every single day. I fear our neighbours would think we were throwing parties
"When I worked in the greetings card shop Birthdays one Christmas, I used to sit in the stock room, listen to Leonard Cohen on my discman, hug the giant teddy bear, and cry."
"At 17 got extremely pissed on a night out with a mate and decided to visit a brothel. When we go there we didn't have any money and would need to go find a cash machine, at which point a dinner lady from school walked by. We left and never returned."
"I used to do night shift security. Once I was alone for the night I'd lock the gates, lock the door and go for an 8 hour kip. Easiest money I ever made and meant I was awake during the day!"
I've only ever slept with my wife but was too embarrassed to admit it so I've been living a lie that I lost my virginity as a teenager. I get nervous as fuck when she asks about my past sexual experiences.
"I work for Tesco and have a list of customers I despise. I regularly plant security tags in their bags, on their clothes and even leave them on the ground beside them so they stand on it and it sticks to their shoes. Some victims still beep months later."
I'm such a shit friend. There are loads of people I wish that I could still regularly speak to but worried it'd be awkward after a few years. Scared to make contact after so long in case the lack of contact was deliberate and they hate me.
"I did years of prison time for bad deeds. I've been an upstanding citizen for years, and even work in the law enforcement field. People who have never done time generally cannot imagine the shame and guilt people like me endure daily. Only my wife knows. Her family has no idea."
"I never know which way to turn taps. Guessing is fine, the odds are good enough. An incorrect guess is the easiest thing in the world to correct."
"I had no idea what a long life meant, I only knew I wanted one. Now, in my dotage all I do is try to remember to dry my balls of the piss dribbled down them after sitting on the toilet... And I wonder, is this it? Itchy sudocrem'd bollocks?"
What's the fucking point?
"When I was a kid, I had a toy Batmobile, the 1966 version. The exhuast tubes on the top were actually missle launchers. I shoved one up my nose, to the great panic of my parents. The doctors couldn't get it out. Years later it fell out of my ear."
"I'm a relatively successful working mother, living with crippling functioning depression. I put bedding on today for the first time in five months and i want to celebrate this depressive episode being over but I can't tell anyone because nobody knows that I wasn't ok..."
"When I'm unpacking the weekly shopping, once I've put away one bag's load I mentally shout Clear!, in the manner of armed police sweeping a building for assailants, as they declare each room safe, before chucking the bag out of the kitchen.I honestly just wish it would stop."
"My wife and I have an open relationship, had a few fun dates but now I just use the time every other week to play dungeons and dragons with some friends"
"I grew up in Merseyside, but I didn't understand the stickers everywhere that say 'don't buy the sun' until quite recently. I always thought it was against a Mr Burns style power hungry solar company"
"I stole an I am 6 badge from Woolworths. I couldn't even wear it, because everyone knew I was 5."

A new Lidl has opened nearby and I felt a genuine frisson of excitement at my first visit this afternoon. Lockdown life.
"We did some e-commerce websites for our local pub chain during lockdown, they were a nightmare to deal with, they didn't pay their full bill and have decided to 'give it a go' themselves. Their effort is terrible. Moral of the story, leave it to the professionals."
"I drank too much when i was 18 and spent the night vomiting, my mother asked in the morning if I had eaten mushrooms the night before as your aunt is allergic to them"
She has removed mushrooms from every meal since thenI confessed to her when I was 45
My wife + I bought a house in 2019. I hate it. My wife has a list of things she wants to do to it and all I see is money vanishing. Should have kept renting at least I had holidays then
Had an interview for a job via Teams last week. 
"Shirt, tie, pyjama bottoms."
"I'm a postman, and I hate delivering all of your non essential shit. Do you really need all those clothes? All those shitty ornaments? Trainers? To go where exactly? The front room? You thick fucks. Stop it. Potentially risking our lives to deliver you crap. I hate you all."
"Sometimes, in moments of boredom, I pick a random Twitter follower and find out what open source intelligence I can find on them. Most of you are reassuringly dull,, but every now and then, I land on a wrong 'un and spend ages reading the court reports."
"As a child, I'd rake in my parents bedroom drawers looking coins. Found this thing that looked like a rubber cactus and thought it was an ornament. Being skint, I took it, wrapped it up and gave it to my granny as an Xmas present. Xmas dinner was quieter than usual that year."
"I love having a piss in the sink, perfect height and the soapy water from my hand washing hides the beautiful crime"
"I eat and drink anything I want except for 5 days a month when I go on a soup and cocaine cleanse. Sorts me right out. I'm 49 and my waist is 30, the same as when I was 18."
When I go to get DIY supplies I change into my painting gear so people think I'm in the middle of a major project.
"A kid I used to teach was sentenced to life, for murder, today. He's the third murderer I've taught. I'm averaging one every five years."
I keep the Rightmove app on my phone because I like to look at the multi million pound properties in London and incorporate them into my fantasy life where I'm sleeping with Chris Evans and we split our time began the UK and US. I'm in my 40s and happily married.
"I tell people that when I work out or clean, I'm listening to podcasts about true crime or politics. Really I'm listening to Vicky Pattinson from Geordie Shore interviewing her mates. It's really entertaining."
"NOTE FROM ADMIN: I (@robmanuel) run this account largely because it makes me laugh & sometimes boggle, but it also takes up a fair bit of my time. Do buy me a sausage if you can, as a small reward, for bothering to try and entertain you. Thx. https://t.co/iErSot9q1I"
"I have a favourite child, it's whichever one happens to be quietest at any given moment"
I am a middle aged Scottish man and I despise both whisky and golf.
In addition to not preheating the oven. I microwave the shit out of everything. I like when bits of ready meals go hard and chewy.

"Since dad died, mum's had more money than a frugal elderly lady can spend, so apropos of nothing she recently gave me £100 cash. As a wealthy professional male in my mid-40s I didn't really need it. I could have given it to a food bank but I bought some weed instead."
Got a first in my Masters Degree Dissertation and primarily cited the original sources from Wikipedia articles. Was praised for my research depth and knowledge.
"Today is my birthday, and I'm sat here completely alone. "
"It's not the lockdown, this is how my life was before and how it will be after. "
Happy birthday me!
"At the beginning of lockdown my wife and I drew up a chart to see how soon we could have sex in each of the 24hrs. After a keen, strong start she got bored of the project. I however remain committed - but almost a year later 4am is still unticked."
"I'm more proud of my cat learning to use a cat flap today, than anything any of my children have ever done"
"My first two valentines days with my girlfriend were fun but now I'm over the whole idea of it, now it's just an extra day on top of Christmas, her birthday and our anniversary where I'm stressing out hoping my presents are good enough compared to hers."
"To relieve stress I record my amazing array of fart styles then play it back, crying with laughter. I've named them: Sidewinder, Baby Elephant, Machine Gun, Ducks Fucking, Thérèse Coffey Sits Down, Howler and Screaming Monkey. I'm the highest ranking woman in my NHS dept."
"I set up a business because I thought that clients I saw were overcharged and given poor quality, and I could improve both aspects. It has worked well, but I have realised that a lot of customers are just cunts"
I used to edit the reader competition page in the tech mag I worked for. Not that many readers ever won it. Me and my friends bagged most of the good gadgets. Made up for the shit pay.
I still haven't paid my fine to Blockbuster and i hope they never find me
I worked with a girl who grassed me up to management for spending my entire working day online shopping. I lost my promotion and was placed on disciplinary. I saw her fiancé on his stag do a month later and pursued him and gave him the blow job of his life behind the club. Karma
I once travelled two hours across London to what turned out to be the wrong funeral. I only realised when I peered into the open casket and realised I didn't recognise the old man in it.
I was a call centre team leader. I heard a young woman making an unauthorised call to her boyfriend to arrange a lift. He promised to give her 'a damn good licking-out' when they got home. Should have sacked her but didn't as I was glad they were happy.
I learned the hard way that it is crucial to keep one's mouth closed while using the toilet brush.
"I'm worried I'm marrying a Karen. She's turned into a nightmare, raging at kids playing noisily outside our house, or drivers turning using our drive. It's so mean spirited, so Tory. I just can't stand it."
"I cited the work of Dr. Michael Hfuhruhurr in a serious work discussion about cybernetics, robotics and AI and no one pulled me up on it. He is Steve Martin's character in The Man With Two Brains."
I've been with my partner for over twenty years. I still have no idea what she likes in bed or what turns her on and I'm too embarrassed to ask. 
Our sex life is shit.

"Tasks at work are quoted about 2x as long as they actually take, so I'm always finished my day's work by lunch and then just play video games all afternoon.Can't tell if everyone else is doing the same thing, or if it genuinely takes them that long, and I'm scared to ask."
Me and my brother used to write rude words with a pointed object - not a pen - on a banana skins in the supermarket when dragged shopping by mum. The words would come up visible as the banana browns.
"Best of @fesshole for Feb 2021. Some great public confessions - funny, interesting, awful - all humanity is here. Do follow and share - plenty more coming. https://t.co/wityhb3mMs"
"Doing a summer shift in an overpriced yuppie cocktail hangout patronised by intolerable twats, I began storing my hangover guffs in the upturned glasses, thus inventing the Fartini."
"I'm a 41 year old man and I'm addicted to buying hot wheels cars. I pretend to the wife I'm doing it for our son but really he couldn't give a shit, I think they're great fun."
Currently having our garden done by a landscape company. Desperately hoping they avoid digging up my wife's teddy bear which I got sick of sharing a bed with and buried two years ago.
"People ask if my long fingernail on my little finger is for snorting coke. Of course I say yeah, 'cos that's far cooler than saying the truth - I use it to scoop out those really hard-to-reach bogeys."
"I was enraged when the Great British Bake Off switched to Channel 4, and swore I'd never watch it again. Now I miss it, I get sad when people talk about it, but I'm too proud to concede so the boycott goes on."
"When I'm in the bath, and I need to fart, I squeeze my legs together so the fart bubbles travel under my legs, tickle my balls and appear magically at my knees. Give it a try. You won't go back!"
"From admin: need to know the time? What it delivered in an unpleasant, sweary way? Follow @swearclock NOW."
I work as a security guard at a department store. This same guy steals baby milk & food every single day. I'll never stop him about it. Hope he reads this. Keep on thieving brother
"I have loud, fake 'conversations' on the phone when I'm on trains etc. Firing people, arranging liaisons, booking jets to NYC, demanding explanations. It makes me sound really important."
"I met my wife when we were both in the audience for Jim'll Fix It as kids. We invited Jimmy to our wedding but he politely refused. We were definitely glad he said no, years later when it all came out."
I only found out in 3rd year of uni that it's not normal to get completely naked to clean your bathroom.I stand by my family's weird choice though. Just makes sense to do it that way and then jump right in the shower.
"I keep my MS Teams status as busy, even when I'm not busy."
My boyfriend wants us to move in together when lockdown ends. But he's gluten intolerant and won't have bread at home. Pretty sure I love toast more.
"I pulled a girl in a nightclub years ago. We went out the back by the bins to get down to business. As I was going at it from behind, I thought I'd give her hair a solid tug. Turned out it was a wig & she was mortified. Needless to say we didn't finish and I never saw her again."
"At university halls of residence, I overheard a Christian guy handing in a fiver he'd found in the launderette. Later, I claimed the money and used it to buy a porn mag with a bird dressed up as a nun on the front cover."
"When I listen to my 16-year-old daughter talking, I hear my own voice echoed back at me. God I am really annoying."

"When we were house-hunting, my wife found her dream house. I managed to talk her out of moving there because of structural issues affecting properties of that era. It was actually because I didn't like the look of the local pub and it had some shitty reviews on Tripadvisor."
"I recently found an old lingerie catalogue of the wife's in a drawer. It's under my bed with the others that I've ordered in her name since, as my wanking material. Going analogue for an old school type wank has been amazing, porn stifles the imagination."
"I like to peel off the little stickers you get on bananas, and stick them on random things."
"When I'm in the shower and there's a sizable soap bubble on my chest, I've taken to moving it over until it covers my nipple like its got a little astronaut helmet."
I'm registered with the Times for their two free articles a week. My password is MURDOCHISACUNT.
"When the first lockdown was announced last year, I was secretly excited because it was a new experience. It was a thrill to see all those dystopian movies come to life. I'm sick of lockdowns now though."
"Our neighbour out the back has a telly so huge that we can watch it, including reading the credits, from inside our house. It's become a source of family commentary - we shout to each other what he's got on. Pete's watching Countryfile. Humphrey Bogart movie. Footie scores."
I've got an app for monitoring sleep. The best bit is listening back to the epic farts in the morning.
"When my husband pisses me off I turn all his clean washing inside out when sorting it out, even the socks. Drives him crazy."
Every morning my children argue over who gets to press the button on the traffic light. 8 out of 10 times I get cross and press it myself. I love pressing the button.
"I eat Red and Yellow Peppers like you would eat an Apple.Not green though, I'm not a monster."
My boss is a high-ranking government minister. Several times I have observed him picking his nose and wiping it on the curtains in his office. Fair fucks to him tbh.
When Zoom and Teams meetings for work became a thing I said I'd dropped my laptop and the camera was broken. It's actually got a piece of electrical tape over the lens - don't have to shave or shower if I can't be arsed.
"I was an 'altar boy' as a kid, and one day I took £1.50 from the collection. The guilt ate away at me and I told a friend. My 'friend' blackmailed me and I had to give him the money. I learned my lesson, though: Never tell anyone about your crimes."
"I just broke one of my husbands brand new chess pieces, but managed to glue it back together in the hope he doesn't notice"
"My entire CV is a fabrication. I had shit jobs for over twenty five years so one day I just wrote a completely fictitious CV and sent it off to some agencies, did some basic reading and am now a senior manager with a local Council with a staff of 40 people."
"As a kid I bought a Spectrum game, played it and then decided to return it as faulty by putting the tape in my stereo and recording a few seconds silence on the tape. Took it back to the shop a got a refund. The shame still haunts me in my forties."

"Work at Aldi. When a middle-class twat insists on packing everything into Waitrose bags at checkout, I double scan a couple of items to teach them a lesson. Lol."
"When I wake up at night and my arm is dangling over the side of the mattress, I jerk my arm up in a panic because I fear monsters are hiding under the bed, as I did when I was a kid. I am 63"
"During the first lockdown, when the Supermarkets ran out of bog roll, I started wiping my arse with Dettol Anti-Bacterial floor wipes and haven't used regulation toilet paper ever since."
"After I've removed them, I regularly feed my disposable contact lenses to the dog when I can't be bothered to put them in the bin."
"My wife is super picky with what she eats. Buying her a box of Roses chocolates is a great double win for me. I get the brownie points for getting her a treat, and most of the chocolates she leaves behind."
"Not long ago I left my bone-idle useless partner, my shit job, bullying boss and 'banter ladz' colleagues and went to live in a seaside village. I am blissfully happy. But I regret wasting my best years on people who don't give a shit."
In early 2019 I had a cancer diagnosis. I still haven't told anyone. I don't want people's well-meaning but relentless questions and overbearing sympathy. When I need to attend treatment I spin a yarn about 'going for physio for my dodgy back'. I prefer it this way.
I'm a prison officer and I love it when I can smell weed on the landings. It chills the aggressive little nobheads out and the smell takes me right back to the great times I had getting stoned in the 90s
"Aged 13, I thought there was a chance that I could be gay. I wanted to test it so decided to put a pencil in my arse to see if it did anything for me. It did nothing, I put the pencil back in my pencil case and 20 years later I'm now married with two kids. Never washed the pencil"
"When I see a Twitter poll with not many votes, I like to help out with my 12 accounts and skew the result against what the twitee was hoping to see."
I once went on a night out with Ralf Little. I had a great chat with him but couldn't understand why we went straight into the VIP section of the local club. I had literally no idea who he was until about 5 years later.
"Son asked why mum doesn't have a willy, so I jokingly said she trapped it in her zipper.I feel partially responsible for why he's now a nightmare to get changed in a morning."
"I keep adding the shite out of my neighbour's front garden to the local free-cycle group. He was kicking off today because gypos nicked his firewood, but it was actually a lovely old lady called Sue."
"My wife has started drinking those really expensive fruit teas. In a bid to stem the tide of pointless purchases, I have been the one making her cuppas. Not only has this been earning me brownie points, she still hasn't realised I've been serving her hot blackcurrant squash."
The final straw which made me divorce my husband was his shit beard
I always thought it was dolphin-wah potatoes until I realised how stupid that was and looked it up in a dictionary.
14th February I sent flowers to the chap across the road and a card saying Thanks Big Boy.
This morning I have spent happy hour watching his wife battering him in the garden.

I got contact lenses purely so I could browse the internet during work Zoom meetings without the moving reflection in my glasses betraying me. I'm writing this during a Zoom meeting. Best purchase ever.
"When I was 19 my boss tried to sexually assault me in the store room. Ever since I've put his name to emails and letters I've sent to radio shows and newspapers, all stating totally asshole opinions. Many have been published and broadcast."
"Not wanting to wake everyone up one night, I shat into an empty metal biscuit tin. It's been 3 weeks and I don't know how to dispose of it. My big fear is putting it in the general waste wheelie bin and the council prosecute me and I end up in the local papers. I'm 48."
I periodically tighten all the jars in the cupboard so I don't feel totally useless to my wife
When I was discovering sex I used to practice with my hair bush handle. One day it came off and got stuck in me. I managed to get my fingers in and get it out eventually. Never sweated so much in my whole life worried I'd have to tell my parents.
The first exercise I had after covid was a wank. My nut milk was a bit yellower than normal
"When I was in my early 20s I had a horrible destructive streak in me when I was drunk. If you lived in Sunderland and found someone had randomly smashed your car mirror off or bricked your windscreen on a Saturday night, it might have been me. Sorry for the inconvenience."
"Got dressed in a hurry recently & couldn't find any pants, so I pinched a pair of the wife's. Made me horny all day, when I got home I banged her in to the middle of next week. Now she thinks I'm having an affair because of increased energy & refusal to undress in front of her"
I sometimes test out the mouldy food on my husband to save throwing it away
As a kid I stole my two-faced friend's Royal Rumble 2006 DVD. That it was missing bugged him for years. I kept it quiet until he was mean to me in 2018. Sent him a selfie holding the DVD and blocked him.
"I studied film and media production and I always said I'd watched The Godfather trilogy and all Star Wars movies. To this day, I've never made it through one due to generally thinking they're crap every time I try. Twenty-plus years later and I'm still living that lie."
"When I was at school I had a mate who used to say he loved a danger wank which involved having a wank and calling his mum to come upstairs, the objective being to cum before she arrived, I thought it was wrong at the time and my stance has not changed"
"When I heat things in the microwave I won't be bothered to enter exact times, I just hit the same number twice. 1:00 gets :66, 2:30 gets 2:22, etc. Microwave food is sad and doesn't deserve precision."
I worked as a maid in a house in Belgravia in the 80s. The address was similar to a cheapo brothel nearby. Twice I answered the door in my maid's outfit and went with a 'client'. Better money than serving breakfast to braying inbred cretins who are their own cousins.
"I order ahead at Starbucks so that when I get there I can walk past the Queue & pick up my coffee & feel superior to everyone else, I literally do it every time & make a point to make eye contact with the people whilst grinning, if they look annoyed its all the sweeter"
If I'm left alone in people living rooms I sometimes check the Sky recordings to see how full the memory is. Anything over 65% makes me nervous

Because I am nosey I found two Valentine's cards in my wife's top draw. Yet on Valentine's Day I only got one of them. The shit one as well.
I post fake sightings of rare birds on twitcher forums to make the sad fuckers drive across the country for no reason.
"I am desperate for normality to return so I can go to a gig. The last gig I went to was Boyzone with my wife, who I've now split up with. I don't want the last gig of my life to be that, thank you very much."
English teacher gave me detention. A month later I shit in his desk drawer. Whole school was in uproar. Still live in fear to this day 30 yrs later if a sample/DNA was taken.
"8 y/o had to make a model of a London monument for his homework last week & I did the whole thing myself. Built a great model of Big Ben using whisky packaging, and didn't let him do anything. He won headmasters commendation for it & it's the best thing that's happened all year."
I have super fast fibre but my family aren't tech savvy so don't really understand. If anyone annoys me I throttle the speed on their devices until they're nicer to me and then I 'look' at their devices and fix it for them
The highlight of my week has been peeling a potato in one go to get one continuous spiral of peel. I can't tell my friends because they'll be all ' You okay mate? Lockdown's hard. Here if you need someone'
"When chopping up cauliflower for a Sunday roast, I like to pretend that I'm a pathologist performing an autopsy on a human brain."
"When I was at university the landlord wanted to let out one of the rooms in the house. We were quite happy as we were, so I pissed on some sponges and stuffed them behind the radiator. The funny smell put off prospective housemates, and the landlord even bought a new carpet."
"I have made a mask of Greg Wallace, I often wear this and shout at myself in the mirror and pretend like I am him, a person who can't talk at a sensible volume level"
"After trimming my beard, I've started using the hoover directly on my face to clear up stray bits of hair. It's oddly satisfying and I don't shed all over my jumper any more."
"I've owned a very successful Italian restaurant for 9 years. On TripAdvisor, we're ranked as the best Italian restaurant & 4th best overall restaurant in our area, out of hundreds. Neither myself or my staff have ever been to Italy, & none of us are even of Italian descent."
My ex and I broke up years ago but when she drops the kids off in her running gear she looks so hot my heart breaks all over again.
I'm in Information Security but use the same 4 passwords for almost everything.
"Due to having a small kitchen, we keep our tumble drier in the bathroom. On a cold day I will pop my pants and socks in for a quick 5 minute tumble before putting them on. "
Warm pants are a great way to start the day.
The missus got me to watch drag race with her and now I really want to fuck two of the queens. I thought I was straight. This is on her.

"I guessed the password to an ex boyfriends fb acc and read his DMs. Found out he'd cheated so rather than confront him I told him I thought I had an STI but didnt know how because I'd only been with him. He confessed, freaked out, went for a check up and got dumped"
"When I'm putting a dirty mug in the dishwasher that still has the dregs of cold tea in, I pretend I'm Kat Slater off Eastenders swilling a drink into some punter's face in the Queen Vic."
"During lockdown my hubby and I have been encouraging the kids to sleep downstairs at least once per week. When we suggest it we get a sideways glance from the 16yr old. She's right though, we do have really loud and amazing sex sessions using our sex toys."
"When a child my mother always told me 'never go up the stairs empty handed'. It has stuck with me ever since, to this day I am the sole household courier. I get to everything first, eager to transport. I often make it a challenge of how much I can fit onto one trip."
"About to become a parent and I'm terrified. Not sure I really wanted this, but no turning back now. In part don't want responsibility, but mostly think this is a shit world for a tiny person"
"My husband left me for another woman and whilst they were waiting for their new flat to become ready he stored her stuff in our house. I got a UV pen and secretly wrote on her Apple computer Roses are red, sometimes they're black, you stole my husband so I wrote on your Mac."
A couple of years ago I grew an enormous moustache. I only did it so my wife wouldn't realise I was trying to find out how long my eyebrows would grow.
"I gave my dad 1.2 bitcoin in 2018, told him to keep onto it for 4 years minium and I resent him for selling it at £10,000."
When a friend losses a loved one I buy them an in sympathy card. I never know what to write and then leave it too long to send. 
I have a draw with 8 cards in. I always buy a new one each time.
"At the local Spar this week I bought more than usual. The lady at the till commented You've a full basket today. I got embarassed and for some reason, I lied. I'm stocking up for a fortnight. Which means I've barred myself from the shop for two weeks."
"During lockdown I have given up smoking, drinking and cocaine, however now I can't stop eating custard creams, I eat them till I feel sick but at 45p a packet I think it's a good deal"
Came out to my parents as gay as I wanted to rebel against their stultifying Telegraph-reading conservatism. To my surprise they were really supportive. Too awkward now to tell them I was lying. I've a long-term gf they know nothing about.
When I'm cooking if I need to tap the wooden spoon on the saucepan or something I will without fail think of the start of the BBC cricket theme. I don't even like cricket.
"A vile woman I used to work with called Susan once did a really smelly poo in one of the cubicles at work, I told everyone and she earned the nickname Poosan. Not sorry."
"In the early days of t9 predictive text and mobile internet, my sister - intending to send me a message with three kisses - inadvertently sent me a link to xxx dot com. It's how I found out I'm gay."
Many years ago I once pulled the calf muscles in both my legs whilst wanking. It was so bad that I could barely walk the next day. Had to tell people I'd injured myself playing football.
"Worked in a offy years ago, keep a bottle by the til and scanned it on every sale, whoops my mistake, thought it was yours sometimes, most times thanks for the beer you bought me unknowingly."

"The Facebook marketplace algorithm has really pinned my interests like never before. My suggested items are now an unadulterated stream of large breasted young women, with prominent pokies, selling tight tops."
I honestly feel that technology is finally working in my favour.
"I regularly fantasise about being famous and making a point of treating everybody I meet very nicely, almost as if they were as important as me."
When I walk through a posh area of London or see someone parked with my dog I let him piss against the cars. He gets bonus treats the more expensive the car.
"I bought some Subbuteo goals at an Aldershot sports shop. I accidentally underpaid by 10p, my brain misinterpreted the sales assistant's that's another 10p please as that's all right thanks and walked out with my purchase. It's preyed on my mind for 38 years."
"While fixing something with superglue it dripped onto my trousers & glued them to my leg. I made my husband phone his dad to ask how to dissolve it but made him say that HE was the one who had glued his trews to his leg. 18yrs later, his dad still teases him about it & I join in"
"My mum thought the collection of pencil cases I started when I was 14 was really cute. She didn't know I'd nicked them all from WH Smiths and Woolies, spending my pocket money on packets of 10 Embassy Red cigarettes instead."
I use the back of a very high kitchen cupboard shelf to store treats for myself. The kids and wife are too short and think its empty.
I work in a factory where pepper mills are made. It's never made sense to me that the pepper comes out of the bottom and then falls all over table when it's not in use. Surely an upside down one would make more sense.
A man DM'd on Instagram me asking if he could shit on me for £50k. I didn't decline but also it turned out he was very constipated and we just had sex instead. I'm now mortgage free with no regrets.
I review motorcycle clothing for a living. The number of dirty emails I get from women with strange requests is astonishing.
I only realised last week that it's 'acorn' and not 'eggcorn'. I'm a teacher in a £30k a year private school.
"Me and my mate both needed a dump at a motorway services. He shat in the cubicle next to mine, Saying look at this mate, I chucked some dirty paper into his cubicle. Didn't know my mate had left and a stranger was on the receiving end. He went mental."
"I like drinking like a cat. Straight from the tap with my mouth underneath, it tastes so much more refreshing than using a glass."
"I have a bag with 500 quid in my sock drawer, just incase I need to run away. Worried during covid fewer places are accepting notes."
While attempting to tidy up the bomb site that is my daughters bedroom I found a huge 10 inch dildo under the bed. She really is going to be disappointed later in life.
My ex-wife stalks my Linkedin. Presumably she checks my FB too. I haven't blocked her on either because I want her to know how well I'm doing and regret the break-up. Revenge is living well.
"My wife used to say to me that friends of hers only have sex with their husbands out of a sense of duty. I get the very strong feeling that's the case with us now. I still really fancy her, but she's rarely interested. Guess that's what happens when you get old."

As a randy teen in 1980s was in Lake District staying in a small B&B. Needed some wank material but no internet filth then nor mags. Used a tourist info leaflet showing middle aged women rambling in brown chords & boots. Still get a semi every time I pass a Millets to this day.
My cat enjoys diving under the bedclothes at night for a special feast when I'm on my period. The first time I was grossed out but now I look forward to it and encourage him. It's actually the best sex I've had for a decade. It takes him a while to clean his whiskers after though
My boyfriend only eats cereal if its been microwaved and I need to know if this is normal or if I'm within my right to be disgusted/horrified by the whole procedure.
"My landlord was kicking me out of my apartment, so he could move in, he gave me 2 weeks notice. I purchased a small quantities of different drugs and left them there for around 6 months and called the police."
I have my own private office with frosted windows. The sofa I got installed as lockdown started has a pull out bed which nobody knows about. Hardly anyone in the office these days so I get a solid 2 hour nap most days. I'm going to order a projector and a mini fridge next.
I work in a large petrol station shop. When reducing near out of date food I usually print a couple of extra cheap barcodes and use them to scan in-date items for myself every few days. Been doing it for about 8 years now. Never been caught. Reckon I've saved about £12k on food
"My wife and I are both middle-aged and working at home under lockdown. Never had so much sex, even compared to when we first got together. It's fucking awesome."
"Now that most people are working remotely, I've managed to narrow it down to either the tall IT guy or Dave from Finance who's doing monster shits and not flushing."
I set 3am reminders saying remind me to have anal recurring annually on every Alexa I see. I do wonder if these subliminal nocturnal messages have an effect but will never know
"I'm supposed to be working, but all I've done all day is argue with randos on twitter. I don't know why I do it, it's entirely unfulfilling and a waste of time, but I can't help myself."
I cheated in my finals at university by having answers written in between my fingers on both hands. I often dream worriedly that one day someone from the uni will come and take my degree off me because they found out.
"Despite decades of viewing hard-core pornography, I still get a thrill when I catch a glimpse of a boob on the telly."
"I hate people driving fast on country lanes so flash my headlights at oncoming traffic so they think there's a speed trap ahead. They always thank me, I feel no guilt"
"My kids have been home for so long, and their company has become so incredibly tedious and irritating, that I don't care if their class is taught by a rabid wolverine that emits coronavirus - they are going back as soon as they open the fucking school gates."
"Ever since self checkout has been introduced I steal at least one major item with every shop. Bottle of wine, piece of meat etc. Only got caught twice and both times blamed the system, they apologised."
I once bought a horrible pair of earrings because the shop assistant reminded me of grace jones and terrified me. I wouldn't mind but I had gone in to return a watch.
"When bored, working from home, I go out in the car and follow random drivers, pretending I'm MI5. Always 1 car back ideally. I call it the Spying Game and you never know where it will take you. Motorways are off limits as I can only sneak off for an hour max."

"Although I'm thoroughly middle-class, I find myself eating my evening meal earlier and earlier as the years go by. The other day I set a new record: 4.25 pm."
I've been telling off my 8 year old for missing the pan when peeing. But I've just realised it's me pissing through the gap between the pan and the seat after I've just knocked one out and am still slightly erect. I wish this was a Didn't happen.
"When aged 6 I really did think 'fun size' Mars bars, Milky Ways and Marathons were so-called because people stuck them up the arse. On 27th December 1984 my dad took me to A&E after a week of constipation. I can't look at a Celebrations Xmas Stocking without thinking of it"
"After trying anal sex with a guy I just met at uni while extremely drunk I accidentally shit the bed. I rolled him into it, woke him up and shouted at him. He changed my sheets while I showered and left. Never saw him again."
Me and my brothers used to drops our pants and fart into the microphone of an old style cassette recorder. We used to be in hysterics listening back to the 60 minutes of bottom melodies. We stopped doing it after my youngest brother squeezed too hard and shat on the tape player.
"Back in October 1990, when I was only 18, I knocked an elderly man down and killed him. I was arrested and charged. However when it went to court I was found not guilty of all 8 charges. Every night when I close my eyes I think could I have avoided him? Did I try hard enough?"
"Work in a sex shop. Straight stuff downstairs, gay upstairs. If the straights r nice I point out they get more for their money if they buy gay lube, & it's also better. If they're not nice I let them buy their tiny tubes of over-priced swarfega that'll dry out & chafe their bits."
"Got a round robin group message from my boss on covid contacting, one of the contacts I recognised as my, and obviously his coke dealer."
"My husbands dying wish was to make people think he led a double life, we had 3 blacked out land rovers follow the courtage and actors in suits and trench coats 'observe' the funeral from a distance- he was a bank manager for TSB and to this day haven't told anyone the truth"
"Got a runny nose while shopping. Didn't want to take my mask off and get death stares, so let the snot run down my lip, like that weird kid in school."
Sometimes when I buy a new household cleaning product I don't test it on an inconspicuous area first.
My husband is such a moody prick that I sometimes wish he would die in work and I would get the insurance payout and live happily ever after
We've had three cleaners in the past six years and all three have used our Wi-Fi scales to weigh themselves. What they don't realise is that their weight pops up on the App.
I told my wife that I don't ever feel like making a big deal of Valentine's Day because my grandfather died on February 14th. I've never had to buy a card or book a restaurant. I have no idea what date my grandfather died.
I get overwhelmed by small things. Sometimes when I write I'm amazed that I can convey my thoughts to someone else with some scribbles. When I go for a shit I think about the incredible plumbing infrastructure that takes it away and cleans it.
"Sometimes when I shower I like to pretend I am Terry Waite after being released from hostage in Lebanon and this is my first shower in 4 years, before a TV news appearance. I gasp gratefully as the water hits my face and revel in the fluffy towels. I'm a 30 year old woman."
"I'm a train driver, and like nothing better than watching someone run for my train, then closing the doors and driving off just as they reach it. It's even more fun when they have heavy luggage. After 15 years, I have never become bored with this."
OK. This is as rough as balls impromptu podcast where @robmanuel phoned 5 or 6 people who've confessed here and had a nice chat. Yes he is VERY BORED.

"I've not seen or spoke to my mother since December, she's 76 and I drive past her house daily on the way to work. It's always 'I'll do it tomorrow'"
"Guess not a confession of laughs,but reading one of my coke confessions and what I thought was funny, reading back and the replies realised it wasn't,was a problem and I've stopped as a result. Won't get laughs but thanks Fesshole"
"FROM ADMIN: I want to speak to a couple of people on the phone who've confessed stuff and record it, to see how it sounds as a one-off experimental podcast. DM me your number and the URL of the tweet you've confessed. (Your identity wouldn't be revealed if this audio is shared.)"
I'm a secondary school teacher. I often keep tabs on the naughty lads on social media in case I need to score drugs once they've left school. My current weed and coke dealers are both ex-pupils.
Growing up there was always some brush on the side of the bath I washed my balls with. Continued until I was about 18 when I realised it was my Dad's shaving brush.
"Back at a guys flat after a night out we ended up doing the naughty on the sofa out of nowhere I dropped a massive wet fart/half a poop. Asked him to get me a glass of water, I flipped over the cushion, he finished the deed, I got dressed and left, gave him wrong phone number."
I absolutely have a favourite child and it is the one that's less annoying.
I like to pause videos of good looking people on my screen so they looked repugnant or mutated. It improves my self esteem.
"I've got long, prehensile toes. I learned the other day that I can peel a banana with my feet, but I'm not sure if this particular skill is going to get me any further in life."
"I made my Dad solder in extra RAM into my Atari ST when I was at school, under the pretext that I needed it to 'make music'. It was really because a mate had lent me a 3 second porn clip on a floppy disc that needed a full megabyte to play."
My company offers click and collect within a few days. 99% are ready in a few hours. If you're a dick to me or my staff you wait 3 days and we love doing this no matter how much you scream and shout.. Please don't be a dick to people who are trying to help you.
"Every few months I nearly buy a GoPro before remembering it's not the lack of a good camera but being unfit, overweight and clumsy that'll stop me ever getting great action footage."
"Got a puppy during lockdown. So far it's shit in every room in the house, eaten the kids toys, pissed on my pillows, dug up my false grass and now decided it wants to chase cars. Taking it a walk three times a day is the only thing that's keeping going through COVID"
"My 15yo son took LSD and had a bad trip. I spent 3 hours holding him and telling him he was safe, scared out if my mind. The next day I was furious at him and he was mortified.Secretly I'm jealous. I'm 51 and have never had the nerve to try anything stronger than weed."
"It pains me to say this, but over time I've come to realise that I quite like Simply Red."
I'm 43 years old and I still have no idea what the hell is going on
I'm 39 this year and I just found my first grey pube. I guess it's all downhill from here on.
I stole about £50 worth of toys from a theme park when I was a kid with my best friend at the time. We never got caught. To this day I don't regret it and would do it again

Years ago I went to a test screening of that awful Madonna film Swept Away. I wrote a damning review that got published on Ain't It Cool. Next thing I knew it was straight to DVD and I like to think I played a big part in that.
I've spent literally thousands of pounds on home recording equipment and software and I haven't recorded a single song. It's just too fucking difficult.
"I have an irrational fear that I see colours wrong. Maybe the sky blue I see is actually what you see as red. Maybe the green grass I see is your purple.I think about it a lot, and it genuinely terrifies me."
"In 2004, while tripping on mushrooms, I threw my parka jacket into a tree in Hyde Park. It was a decent parka and I still regret my actions."
I had violent diarrhoea at a girlfriend's caravan. It sounded like a bucket of snails being tipped down a well. The stench was eye-watering. I came out & her parents were sitting in the next room with the doors and windows open. There was a storm outside so no-one could leave.
My husband is really enjoying how much more adventurous I've been in the bedroom doesn't know it's out of guilt after I accidently knocked over his mother's ashes and the dog ate some.
"My husband keeps buying shoes that clip clop over the wooden floor, it drives me mad. I make them 'disappear' mysteriously to save my sanity. I've thrown three pairs out in the past year. He's never thought to blame me."
About 20 years ago I once told my in-laws I was off upstairs to watch a James Bond film when really I just wanted to get away from them. And so followed two decades of shit 007-related presents every fucking birthday and Christmas. My own fault.
"Twitter idiot was having a go about the company I work for on Twitter. Went on for days over something minor and she was lying, so I entered her account, changed her settings so she never gets discount codes or free delivery. I'm not sorry Kevin, you twat."
"When I was a student I used to go to the supermarket, weigh empty cartons at the salad bar & put the barcode sticker on. Then I'd fill up with the dearest prawn salad cos I knew that as long as the cashier heard the beep they'd not check it. Was months before I got pinged."
Told my family I wanted a book about nature for my 8th birthday and all I got was books about nature and nothing else. I only wanted one. I still hate them for it and I am 46 now.
"I once went to a Eurovision party where everyone had to represent a country. I went as an Albanian gangster. Suit, scar, gun, the lot. It turned out I was supposed to take food, not dress up."
"Exiting Morrison's last night, I was accosted by a homeless woman who begged me for spare change. Fearing her to be an Angel in disguise come to test me, I took her to the nearby ATM and gave her £20. Likely spent on booze, but you can't be too careful."
"After 9 years together my wife has developed her BJ technique to perfection. Clamp on and wank me off into her mouth. It's stunning. There is no confession here, I just want to tell the world."
"Three weeks after she died, I literally saw my mum's ghost while I was clearing the house. Large as life in the kitchen, there one minute, gone the next. But I haven't told anyone because I've always said I don't believe in ghosts."
"Back in the days of peer to peer sharing I used to let people get to 99% upload from me then cut them off. Robbing twunts, should buy their own stuff."
Met a guy on Tinder. Chatted for a bit. Went to his work and pretended to the people there I wanted to buy solar panels for my house.He shagged me on his desk. Only offered me a 5% discount on the solar.
"Steven, you always said you were fitted up for vandalising the school war memorial, and you were. I accidentally broke it when I kicked a ball against it. But you were always a twat to me in primary school so I wasn't going to own up."
I've been an IT consultant for nearly 30 years. The past 10 years or so I've been regarded as an industry expert in blockchain technology and advised many startups on using it. I haven't a clue what it is.

I go the opposite way in that I knock a few inches off my height on tinder and POF. That way the girls who's filters still match to me expect worse and get a nice surprise.
When I was 6 I hid from my parents in a shop by pretending to be a mannequin. I remember standing still while they frantically talked in front of me about where could I be. I was so pleased with myself! It dawned on me when I was in my 30s that they were pretending. Bastards.
Porn has completely ruined my life.. I can't get turned on anymore by anything. It's destroyed my life. My sex drive has been annihilated. I'm in my early 30's but I don't see myself finding anyone or even being truly happy ever. I don't see any out.
"I've never smoked in my life, but every morning when I cut carrot sticks for my"
son's packed lunch I hang one on my lip and take imaginary drags like I'm Jean-Paul Belmondo.
I work with hundreds of other middle-aged white males and I find it impossible to remember their names. They've merged into a collective Simon / Joe / Steve / Dave.
"As a kid, I broke one of the clocks in Stuart Hall's clock museum. Didn't tell anyone and felt guilty about it for years. That is until he was revealed as a sex offending cunt. Wish I'd fucked more of them up now."
"My family think I've turned vegetarian for environmental reasons, but it was actually because I had a really vivid dream involving a crying chicken.I can't even think about eating meat without remembering how distraught she was."
"I like potentially viral tweets early on and then go back to see if they indeed did go viral! Don't know why I do it, but always feel like a winner when they do!"
"As a child at Boarding school, we would fashion 'lost teeth' from Murray mints & leave them under our pillows to get extra money to buy Murray mints, at the tuck shop."
My wife gives terrible handjobs and no matter what I it always seems like she's trying to pull the end off. I spend the next few days trying to to protect the raw bits and staying downstairs until she's asleep so I can recover before the next assault.
"In lockdown I've watched the Marvel films with my 15yo son. We've just finished the last one and it was fantastic, I laughed, cried, and was on the edge of my seat. I'm hooked, on to the TV shows next. I can't talk to the other mums about it because they think it's childish."
I used to think a kingfisher was the same size as an eagle as they were the same size in my kids picture bird book. Saw one recently - they're mid size at best.
"About 15 years ago I took my dog out, he did a huge shit and I had nowhere to dispose of it so I bagged it up in a bin bag and put it in my boot - when I came back my car window had been smashed and they had taken the only item in my boot. Karma."
"I'm a multi-millionaire but a couple of times a week I log into my Amazon orders and speak to the customer service bot and get refunded instantly by them by simply saying something didn't arrive. Fuck Bezos, he owns a hollowed out mountain."
I'm a primary school teacher and the Covid face mask is my very favourite thing. For every piece of illegible scribble that is shown to me I can actually mouth 'for fucks sake' instead of just thinking it.

"I can't visit my elderly mother because of Covid, when we call each other on speaker phone she always forgets to hang up. I like listening to her making a cup of tea & singing and walking round the house for a while."
After a month of constipation and diarrhoea I had a normal shit today. Who cares about sex when you get relief like that.
My girlfriend's ex was horrible and toxic to her and as a result she's latched onto me now because I'm a decent person. The problem is I want to break up after a few years now but feel too guilty for how it would hurt her - it's ruining my mental health.
"I drive to Tesco car park for a 1.5 hour nap after I finish work to avoid going home to my wife, toddler and baby. My wife believes my work finish time is later than it actually is. It's been this way for three years."
"My dog spends all day lounging on my bed. I give her a specific command when I want her to go nap on the sofa, so I can masturbate. She looks at me every time, as she's leaving my bedroom as if to say Again?! Seriously??!?!"
While at work one Saturday morning my wife sent me a picture of herself and the cat in bed. I could see a bit of her nipple in the picture so replied telling her so. She then sent me a picture of her tits. I immediately went to the bogs and had a wank. It was class.
I'm falling deeply in love with a man who seemingly does not wash his hands after he takes a shit. Don't know how to approach this issue.
"I regularly feed my 18 month old kids food they've dropped on the floor, even though I'd never do the same thing myself. I think it's helping them build a strong immune system."
"My first boyfriend died last year, aged just 49. I still wank off regularly thinking about his amazing cock. I genuinely know this is how he would want to be remembered."
Husband complains that I'm too lazy and/or forgetful to replace the spare loo roll in the bathroom cupboard. I do it on purpose in the hope that he'll panic when there's nothing to wipe his condescending arse on.
Sometimes at night I'm too tired for the full two-minute electric toothbrush routine so I'll use a manual toothbrush rather than disappoint my electric toothbrush with a short clean that leaves it unfulfilled.
I'm writing this while trying to push out a rather stubborn poo.. then I'm reminded of how Elvis died so I think I'll come back and try again later
"Was seeing this lass, I ghosted her, we got back in touch, I explained my situation. Then after a few years we were on the verge of starting something proper then she ghosted me. Not a day goes by that I don't regret my initial action."
"Whenever I'm driving friends around at night, I'll tell them I've got night blindness in the middle of the drive. I don't, but hearing everyone scream and cry for a minute before they realize it's bullshit is fun"
If he wants sex my husband has to wear the knickers and bra I'm wearing. Not for a fetish but they're too small for him and it makes me laugh. Makes me happy
"I'm at the stage in a relationship where my partner can talk to me about something I've no interest in and I don't even bother to pretend to show any interest, in the hope that the conversation will stop. It's so liberating."
When I was 17 I wanked the family dog off to amuse my friends. I'm deeply ashamed - Dusty really enjoyed it - but it ruined our innocent bond.

"I'm 46, have worked in the same place since I was 19 & I'm pretty high up. I have probably made more money selling drugs in work over the years than in salary. It started with a bit of hash amongst my mates & just escalated from there. I even give overtime to help them pay."
I don't wash the baking tray after every use. I just put it back in the oven and leave it until next use. Probably only wash it once a month. Hasn't killed me yet.
"I think romantic comedies have a lot to answer for. Always assumed I'd end up with 'the one', but instead she moved to Australia and got married to another guy, whereas I stayed here in the UK and married the wrong woman. Nearly 20 years later still wonder about it."

"Over the last 12 months I've reverted to teenage me. I masturbate all the time. I've started having challenge wanks, Anne Widdecombe took a really long time, I exploded and now my dick is throbbing, it really hurts. Meh, reload in a few hours."
Every time I play Strangeways Here I Come I pause it straight after the second line of Stop Me and laugh at my own joke like I'm a comic genius.
"Despite never being in a car crash, I'm jealous of people who have and received large payouts."
Sometimes I can't be bothered to use loo roll and I just wash my arse in the sink.
With the pubs shut I've saved enough money to build a pub in my garage and go from 4 days work a week to one. I love covid
I prefer reading about video games to playing them. Even Animal Crossing is stressful. Too much responsibility. I dare not switch it back on and see the consequences of my neglect.
"Went home with a girl I'd been seeing and when I used her bathroom, I noticed she had signs up all over like bath and get naked and I knew there and then it wasn't going to work so I pretended I had the shits, left and blocked her number"
I despise The Sun and all of the lies and sensationalised crap they print.. but I bloody love the Dear Deidre section.
"Every Friday night for the last 4 years I've secretly thrown an egg on top of my neighbour's roof. He went up to replace a tile yesterday and said the mess up their was unbelievable. There's no reason for this, I think I need help."
I've written to Unilever to complain that the sachet of soy sauce in a king sized pot noodle is the same size as the sachet in a regular pot noodle.
"I'm on the verge of divorcing my husband because every time he burps - i.e. frequently - he chuckles to himself and says 'ooh, windy pops'. He is nearing 50. It's fucking embarrassing."
I went to primary school with who is now a beautiful celebrity. At the end of school disco I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes! I never saw her again. Whenever I see her on telly I always shout She's technically still my girlfriend I'm 42 and married with 3 kids.

My husband's hair parting has moved from one side to the other during the pandemic. When I raised this with him he said it was always that way. I don't have the heart to tell him he has gone mad.
We tell our kids if they behave we'll let them stay in bed until after 10am on the weekend.
"I have written an anonymous column in a mainstream national newspaper for almost two years, read by hundreds of thousands of people. I have told nobody except my partner and it's driving me batshit."
"If I'm driving on my own on an empty road, I will scream and swear as loud as I can for about 5 minutes - I feel very calm afterwards."
"I'm re-watching Cheers for the first time since I was 10. I now see Sam is alcoholic, everyone is sexist and treat women poorly, every joke is something I've said at school and ever since. I modelled my persona on awful people"
Im a married man with a family but I get this reoccurring sexual dream where Den Watts off EastEnders is sucking me off. Im surely not gay if it's just a dream?
I tell every disgusting greasy guy that messages me on Grindr they're hot and out of my league before instantly blocking them. There's no need to be cruel.
"Once when trying to get into a club with a smart shoes policy, at the back of the queue I slipped off the black socks I was wearing and pulled them over the outside of my trainers, making them look a bit like slip on brogues. Bouncer let me in. Club was shit #abit"
"My mum died 4 years ago, but my dad won't delete her voice on the answerphone. He says it's a reminder of her, but the reality is it freaks the shit out of callers who think she's talking to them from the grave."
"Whenever I get up in the night, I always look out of the bedroom window just to make sure my bedroom is not a replica and that I've not been transferred to the Village from The Prisoner."
"I have a senior marketing role in a global chocolate brand. I know very little about marketing, but have managed to build a successful career on periodically suggesting we use two for one offers. Keep moving countries to avoid being found out."
I have a first name that's very similar to another name. Once went a whole 18 months in a job where everyone called me by the wrong name. If you don't correct people straight away you actually can't after a few weeks. Left in the end.
"I listen to 90s boybands on YouTube because I know if I listen to them on Spotify my friends will judge me. And I'll say it here, Westlife were great"
I used to report ads I didn't like the look of on Facebook and Instagram until I found out that they cost the company per click. Now I take great delight in clicking on every single one. It's the modern day equivalent of sending back junk mail in the prepaid envelope supplied.
"When I was younger I used to drift off to sleep recalling previous shags and fantasising about dirty rendezvous with loose women, now I drift off to sleep imagining being single and doing up a little flat, camper van or old car all by myself. Fuck me I'm old."
Since working from home I've masturbated to Harry Styles music videos on most of my lunch breaks. Can't hear Watermelon Sugar without my clit throbbing now.
"There's a perfume my wife sometimes wears which she knows really turns me on. What she doesn't know is that it reminds me of my ex, with whom I spent a summer romping around European sex clubs."

"Every day, I try to find a racist or a homophobe on Twitter, simply so that I can report them for hateful conduct. It feels like taking out the trash."
My 3yr relationship ended about four months ago and I moved out of her flat. I wonder if the ex has found the chopstick I kept in a bathroom plant for chopping up monster otters that wouldn't flush?
"For unknown reasons I get a fair bit of unsolicited email from American religious organisations. If I can find a named email address to use, I start to sign them up to PornHub in the hope it leads to lots of spam in their inboxes too."
"My nine year old is suddenly a hugely entitled, cheeky, miserable pain in the arse. I'm sure it's linked to puberty and lockdown and whatnot, but honestly right now they're just an utter twat. I feel better for saying that."
"I often listen to podcasts and audiobooks on headphones, but I even more frequently wear headphones which aren't connected to anything just so my kids and husband will give me five minutes of fucking peace."
"Mine was a good mother as I was growing up but she's now in her 70s and has become a moaning, bitter, self absorbed old cow who can't find anything good to say about anyone. I struggle to be in a room with her & I know this probably makes me a bad person."
I found a bag of coke on the way home from work. I went to my girlfriend's house and she racked up a huge line whilst I was in the shower. Whoops! It was ketamine. That was a long night.
"I watched sci-fi endlessly when I was a kid. Now I carry an iPad around with me all the time. I may look like I'm answering emails or checking social media, but in my mind I'm on the Starship Enterprise, reading a disciplinary report about an ensign who didn't follow orders."
Offered someone a job today just because I liked their eyebrows
"I bought a pre-built PC with one of the low-stock RTX cards. It was about £200 more than it would have cost to build it myself, so I was mocked for not doing so.I got my PC next day delivery. A few months later, they're still waiting for their cards. I am so smug it hurts."
"My neighbour hasn't secured their smart TV, so every now and then I'll cast some spectacularly hardcore porn onto it - sometimes I hear a scream from them. No regrets, they have a bloody yappy dog."
"I keep peanut M&Ms, peanut butter, and jelly out in my car. My wife thinks I go out to the garage to smoke weed, and I do, but I'm eating candy too and don't want to get caught."
"The first time I set eyes on my now wife, she was having sex with two other men. It's a long story, we always struggle with how did you two get together? though."
"I put tinted film on all my windows, so I could walk care-free around the house naked. I only realised how ineffective it was when I got an angry note from a very unimpressed neighbour, threatening to involve the Police. I now have to walk around with pants on."
"If I'm ever awake in the night I think about every potential sexual opportunity I turned down and replay them in my head with different outcomes. The one I think of most is when Fiona asked me back to her place to see her horses. It wasn't really to see the horses, was it Fi?"
Sometimes I reckon the massive hemorrhoids and anal fissures are the only things keeping me from being single again and slutting it up. But I'd better stick to the only person who'd be willing to have sex with someone whose bumhole looks like mine.
During this pandemic one of my survival needs has been smoking a lot of quality weed. When I score I give my cats catnip so I'm not alone to party.

"I discovered tubs of crispy onions in the supermarket and now get through one a week, eaten by the handful. Less calorific than crisps, possibly one of my five a day. Still, I can't imagine getting away with this if I didn't live alone."
"Whenever someone annoys me at work, instead of arguing back now I just say Let's park that for later. But I pronounce for later as in fellator, like I'm calling them a cocksucker, but I'm the only one who knows"
"I found one of my school bullies on Facebook and delighted to find he spends his days posting Covid, Trump and Brexit conspiracy theories, and I really really needed that laugh."
I'm seriously considering asking my husband if he'd be comfortable with me doing solo porn on a paid platform. I can't deal with my job anymore and the only skill I have is being able to have like 30 orgasms in a day.
I always secretly ensure that my girlfriend has the auto steer function on Mario Kart so she never falls off when she's playing. I dread the day she realises she's not good when she plays with other people who notice
"Early 90's, 19 years old, posted to Germany. In the hypermarket sex shop in Dortmund, ended up buying a cheapo rubber sex doll. Got back to camp and that doll got passed round the troop quicker than a joint. The blokes still carried on fucking it when it's head popped."
Every one of my significant ex-girlfriends has either ended up divorced or unmarried. I feel I was the canary in the coalmine for their poor romantic decision making.
"I just watched a porno of an older lady teacher jacking off a young, nervous male student. It turned me on so much I think I need to quit my teaching job."
"When I left my job at DPD I kept a load of 'Sorry We Missed You' cards, I occasionally post them through my arsehole neighbours letterbox to drive him mad thinking he's missed a delivery or forgotten he's ordered something"
"I hope they find the culprit of keying the bosses Tesla, such a shame he parked it in the blind spot for the cctv cameras"
I discovered a written erotica site in my wife's internet history and started writing stories for it that I know she would like. I get a secret thrill whenever I see she has read one.
I'm a manager at work earning £50k+. I always make the tea for the team. Not because I like them but because I can easily waste an hour over the course of a day by doing this.
"Best of @fesshole for Jan 2021. All public confessions - some funny, some fascinating. Do make sure you follow - plenty more stuff coming. (Our fav? Probably the one about Keith Harris and Orville) https://t.co/2sy3G6O6Is"
"I ate a trifle for 4 all by myself, in one sitting. It was delicious and I will do it again."
"I'll race my dog about the house at any opportunity, I'll look at him and then run, he always plays along and always wins, its the turn on the stairs he's got me beaten on"
"My wife loves the occult, calls herself a witch and practices harmless rituals. I can't bring myself to tell her Astrology and tarot cards are bollocks. I HATE the smell of incense. Our flat reeks of it."
Sometimes I throw away stuff that is in perfectly good working order just because I enjoy the camaraderie with the men at the tip.
I've been working from home since April 2020 and my daily wank is now paid for so technically I am now a sex worker.

When I was 12 I saved the neighbor's toddler from getting crushed by a bulldozer. Even though nobody had seen it I felt very proud. 3 years later the kid got cancer and rotted away before our eyes. Not saving him would have prevented so much suffering. Still gutted. Fuck God.
I snitched on my neighbour for breaking lockdown rules just so that my 4 year old son could get to see a police car. He loves the police.
"I'm extremely liberal, left wing. I cried when Trump was elected, and when he lost, shed tears of pure joy and hope for a better future. But, and I do hate to say this, I kind of miss him. Twitter is significantly more boring without him."
I picked two random names from the phone book. I wrote to each from the other saying I remembered them from school and suggesting we meet for a pint. Obviously never found out if they did.
"Whilst waiting outside a local school for a photography evening class I accidentally set my flash gun off. A car going by braked hard thinking it was the nearby speed camera. I am so sorry for the many, many evenings I ruined for people after that."
"I've written over 1000 answers on questions on Yahoo Answers, I have had zero knowledge of any of the subjects involved, several of which have zero chance of being true . With over 200 being chosen as the top answer."
"Whenever I give a blowjob to a new guy, I always say 'you've got a big dick' but most of the time they don't. I hate giving head. It's like sucking on a salty firework. Stop pushing our heads down too. Get off!"
"i once left a message on the Rover website for a callback. Left my mates number and the name Mr Pee Niss. 10 minutes later a lady called, asked his name - he gave his name - she started laughing and hung up. He looked confused. She called back later, still laughing."
I find being a parent mostly very boring and think that anyone who has more than 1 kid on purpose is insane.
"A few years back, whilst out on a pub crawl, I was behind a lady at a cash point. She left without her card, still logged in to her account so I withdrew £50."
I had an immediate change of conscience and returned her £50 and told her the machine threw it out.
"Went to a posh wedding shop in '96 to hire suits for my wedding,staff looked down their noses at us as we walked to the men's department.We waited ages & nobody attended to us. So I told my brother to go and keep watch, I took a shit in a top hat and wiped my arse with a cravat."
"I shaved my knob for the first time last week. I had no idea they got hairy as you got older and was shocked how much of a mess it had become. Better sex and wanking already, but mainly I can't stop stroking it when flaccid because it's so soft and smooth, like a baby vole."
I much prefer my ex-girlfriend's parents to my current girlfriend's parents.
"As a teen I went on a beach holiday with my parents. My mum caught me stuffing a hanky down my Speedos. 'I don't have any pockets,' I said. She gave me a look as though to say, 'Really?'"
I'm 22 and haven't learnt how to drive yet. I've always gave the excuse that it's too expensive or I don't have the time - in truth I'm just terrified of being put in control of a two ton steerable missile.
"I'm of a certain age where every time I have a wank it's terrifying to think that, if there's a heart attack, everyone's going to see 30 tabs of porn and judge my corpse."
When I was 8 I had to get circumcised for medical reasons. After I could urinate so high it would hit the ceiling. Googling now it would appear I had meatal stenosis & should have got it looked at. Unbeaten at the urinal pissing competition though.
"I'm 54 and have been a journalist for 30 years. I know what nouns and verbs are, but have no clue what any other grammatical term means: clause, adverb, subjunctive, gerund, conjunction et al. I write very well and have no desire to understand the parts of sentences I construct."

I am a tantric sensual masseuse and massage and wank off men daily. Most men have small cocks and are poor at grooming. They cum very quickly and always seem to make a sound bite or quip just after it like I shot for the stars there.
"In the early 2000s I was having a sexy chat with a man who asked for a tit pic. Not having a digital camera, I decided to slap 'em on the scanner instead. Amazingly, he blocked me, not being into flat tits."
I always use a Euro coin in trolleys instead of a pound. It's a small rebellion for us missing joining the euro. Sometimes I'll swap trolleys when I'm done and take the pound coin from the next customer if they look particularly gammony
I manage Facebook pages for a fair sized company. People leave arsey comments on ads and posts all the time. Did you know that page admins can hide comments so only the people who post them see them? I hide EVERYTHING.
I sometimes have trouble peeing at a urinal when I know someone is waiting to use it. I found that if I close my eyes and imagine I'm sucking a cock my pee starts right up. I'm not gay.
"When I meet anyone as I leave the toilet after a poo I feel an overwhelming sense of shame. They KNOW I was in there, crouched over squeezing shit out of my arse. Shudder."
"After a delicious roast dinner, me and my wife let our dogs lick all the plates clean. They love it. Everything then goes into the dishwasher and is cleaned well. What's wrong with that?"
One of my best friends died from covid on my birthday my last year and it haunts me that I'll never be able to chew him out for forever ruining my birthday with his shite timing. I still tear up thinking about him.
A read of my save to drafts would reveal everything about me and make me completely vulnerable.
Lockdown has taught me that Comando is the only way to go and haven't worn underwear since April. My wife hates the thought so I take a fresh pair from the draw every morning and put them straight in the wash basket. She hasn't sussed me yet
"2002, lads holiday in Minorca. Stripped our runt of the litter mate naked and tied him to a sun lounger on the beach one night. This pretty hot girl came and fucked him. He was the only one who got laid the whole two weeks."
"My mates and I ran a sweet tuck-shop as a project at school. We ate most of the stock, gave some away for influence, and sold very little. In the end we had to cook the books to hide our embezzlement. We passed the project."
Paid a random hot girl online to get nude photos of my best mate. Was going to put them on t-shirts for all of us on his stag do. Wish I'd not bothered. It's huge.
"I feel horrible saying so, but when my parents die the worst part is going to be dealing with the mountains of bullshit in their hoarder house, not grief over them passing."
I've started leaving bad online reviews for my work. If head office won't listen to us maybe they'll listen to customers
"Until I was about 15 years old, I thought the Ministry of Sound was a branch of the UK Government"
I regularly have dreams where I'm sucking myself off. I'm always disappointed when I wake up because I'm not really that flexible

Every day when I'm out I perform a random act of kindness towards a stranger. Buying the person behind me in the drive thru their coffee etc. My wife wonders why I spend so much and why we don't have as much money as we should but I can't tell cause she'd go spare if she knew
"I've put on two stone in the last year. I'm still exchanging flirty messages with female friends like we could meet up and shag tomorrow, but if we did they'd be disgusted by me."
My gf is veggie and thinks I am too. But I order chicken wings on deliveroo when she's not about then hide evidence. I had to get second phone so she wouldn't see orders when we get takeaway. Now she's worried I'm dealing drugs.
"I'm a care assistant, currently at work, and I just bit into a digestive biscuit. Two pointy bits of the biscuit broke off at each side of my mouth and I imagined I was a vampire for a bit."
"Dear Class 5C at St George's. it was me who added an 'F' to all the signs in the library with 'Art' on them. Sorry about the detention we all got for my childish behaviour. Although, I still giggle about it 50yrs later."
I have been making music since 2002. I have never had any commercial success. I always blamed it on not getting noticed. In December a proper label got in touch about releasing some of my stuff. Now I just sit around playing video games and drinking. I'm scared of fucking up.
I once pulled a chair out from behind one of my dad's friends as he went to sit down. He broke his back. I pretended to have an asthma attack just so I wouldn't get a bollocking. He continued to have issues for the next 20 years. I was fine.
"One of our three dogs died, and while I buried the body in the garden the other two watched and gave their pal a final sniff. Those dogs now seem scared of me."
I have been stealing my neighbours garden wind chimes and I will continue to do it until they stop buying more. No one needs clanging and tinkling at 3am
I can't read maps and hate if people want to show me directions on a map. They make no visual sense to me. 
I have gotten everywhere I needed to by asking do I turn left or right at the next turn.
"I have come to the inescapable conclusion that on an intellectual, financial, emotional, physical, and aspirational level, I am the settler' within my relationship. I am unsure if this is a good thing or not, as I'm now doubting the relationship."
When I take a leak I can't stop my head saying the Tetley Tea advert phrase let all the flavour flood out complete with strong Yorkshire accent
People have always accused me of being miserable because I never smile but the truth is I'm too embarrassed about my teeth and don't like showing them. I confect faux outrage and always complain about things so I don't have to smile.
"When my vegan boyfriend is pissing me off, I put beef stock cubes in his Quorn spag bol. He never, ever cooks, so it's just what he deserves."
My husband told me he was going through customs once and they asked if he had anything to declare and him thinking he was funny said  only the crack in my arse. They took him to a room so they could check with the rubber gloves on. 
He tells everyone like he's proud of it
"When I poo I like to turn all the lights off. I believe it helps to relax my sphincter. If it's not possible to turn the light off, I'll cover my eyes with my hands. I've scared my fiance a few times when she's walked in on me in the pitch black."
"Started a sexual relationship with a man that I met on twitter ; we just meet up occasionally for a cheeky bang, and I'll be honest I'm having the best sex of my life. "
Just hope my husband doesn't find out and ruin it for me.

If I'm given a compass direction I have to start at north in my head and work round the compass. Every single time. 
My job is a cargo pilot with thousands of flying hours.
I let the kids have a fight after dinner so I could put them to bed early - 8.30pm - and play computer games. Sitting here with a glass of wine and feeling great!
"I used to be so fearful of getting on the wrong side of my ex wife. That once, rather than disturb her having a shower so I could go for a shit, I went to my garage and shat in a Morrisons bag for life."
"There is a family of rats living under my shed and no one knows. They come out even during the day to eat the food I put out for the birds. I actually like seeing the cute little buggers stuffing their tiny faces, they're like my secret garden pets."
"I never wash salad or vegetables when it's my turn to cook. If asked, I say I have washed them. No one in the family has died or grown extra limbs."
"I'm a night owl, and my wife has made snide remarks about what I watch after she's gone to bed, assuming I'm fapping myself dry to Babestation. I'm watching Talking Pictures. Usually Rumpole."
The surgeon who did my vasectomy complemented me on my ball shaving. As a result it's a look I have maintained ever since.
I haven't brushed my teeth in 8 days. Tonight I'm going to brush them before bed as a treat. The film they're covered in at the minute is going to be so satisfying to remove
"Despite ample evidence to the contrary, I find my opinions are still often coloured by what went without saying among my school classmates over 40 years ago: eg, only thickos like football; all people with shaven heads are thugs; coats with hoods are worn only by nerds, etc."
I wish a terrorist or accident would destroy Facebook and Instagram's data centres so that my partner would be forced to do something other than endlessly scroll through their phone
"Had to shit outside at dawn, camping. Friend of friend had a huge dog. Half way through I realized it was gobbling down my shit underneath me. It got impatient and started taking it straight out of my bum while I retched. Later you could smell my shit on the dog's breath."
My wife and I took MDMA in first lockdown in April. Very rogue decision but certainly will be a story to tell our kids in a few years
I have collected crumbs of drugs from strangers carpets and taken them after running out of my own on many occasions and I'd do it again
Many years ago FHM did a piece about pleasing a lady and how nail cutting was so important. To this day I think about not scratching labia every time I cut my nails.
I frequently forget whether or not I've unplugged a dangerous appliance before I leave the house. I've started videoing myself unplugging stuff as a reminder.
"I'm in my 40's, my beautiful girlfriend is 30 and she's so insecure she's convinced whenever I pick up my phone I'm setting up gay hookups. She claims to have evidence. It's 100% not true. It's like QAnon in one house."

I work for on debt recovery affordability checks- in other words if people can afford to pay back their payday loans- I often 'forget' to adequately check the system and grant them extensions with repayments frozen for the duration and think of myself as a modern day Robin Hood
My Shower gel and deodorant ran out at the same time and I've been on a giddy high all day about it.
"I'm a lesbian in my 40s. My subscription to the WTA tennis tour is my no.1 source of erotica material. I have jacked off to this even more than the Cate Blanchett film Carol, and that's saying something."
"I was home alone one night, so ordered a massive takeaway. I over-ate so much, when I lay on my side hours later, the chilli sauce oozed back up & I almost choked to death. I didn't tell my family, but I do wonder what they would've made of finding me dead in that fashion."
At the start of lockdown 1.0 a colleague sent me a WhatsApp of her tits to cheer me up. They are fantastic and have kept me happy at my desk at home into lockdown 3. No law of diminishing returns on these bangers
"I had 6 Bitcoin and sold them for $73 each because I wanted to buy Golf clubs, The 6 coins are now worth £160,000. The golf clubs are in the garage with dust on them"
"Since one of my confessions got published here, my boyfriend reads them all, feeling a bit paranoid to see if any others crop up. If you're reading this Stef, I LOVE the pants off of you. Thank you for putting up with me over the years x"
"I didn't get married for love, I got married for boobs."
"Thinning hair was one of the best things to happen to me. I shaved it all off, looked great and never looked back. All those teenage years worrying about what my hair looked like. What a waste of energy."
"We play a game called Guess The Deaths at work at around 3.30pm every day, where we try and Guess how many people have snuffed it Covid that day. We've got prizes and everything."
Switched to pay as you go at the start of lockdown. Spent less than a tenner on my mobile since.
"Back in 1975 as an 8-year-old Cub Scout during Bob-A-Job week, I arranged to wash the dog for a family living several blocks away. They asked me to come back on the weekend to do it but stupidly paid me right then and there in advance. I never went back to wash the mutt."
Just had the best parents evening ever. Was smoking a spliff throughout the entire 'online' event.
When entering a toilet cubicle at work I imagine myself as an FBI agent going into an unknown house and shout 'CLEAR' in my head once I know the facility is clean and fit for use.
"Since wearing masks in shops became mandatory, I've a habit of covertly talking like Mr Bean whilst shopping, expressing disapproval and annoyance towards other shoppers and making cheerful noises when my favourite items are available."

"About a year ago my 43 year old wife admitted to a having a few one night stands behind my back. Hen nights, work trips away etc. I admitted I'd done the same. We've never been closer and the sex is hornier now than ever. The truth is out there and it's hot to share it"
When I was a teenager I used to put my nob through my now ex-girlfriend's front door as a joke when her parents went out and she'd give it a little lick. We never got caught and she went on to be a postie.
Around 8% of our companies revenue comes from Superman 3-esque accounting that our clients aren't aware of
"Whilst home schooling my children during lockdown I try my hardest with the important subjects. On a Tuesday when it's the RE lesson, the effort slackens right off. Bollocks to that nonsense."
I know we're in a lockdown but I haven't seen hide nor hair of my neighbours kids for months.
We're convinced that he's murdered them.
"I always say sausages in the manner of the talking dog from That's Life. Now my kids do too, but they've never asked where it comes from and I've never told them."
The flat opposite had two beautiful cats i liked to watch. I wasn't emotionally ready when they suddenly moved away and I miss them sorely. I made up names and backstories for them and everything
"When I was a student and couldn't be bothered to wash up, I'd sometimes eat my meal off a pad of lined A4 paper, rip off and throw away the top few sheets when finished. I'd still do it occasionally today if I lived on my own."
"Had a text from my cleaner to say she had finished and would be off the following week, Suddenly remembered I had left my Fleshlight suction cupped to the tiles in the shower the night before. Came home that evening and she had hung my flannel over it"
"Once, during a random sexual encounter, I shot a load with such force that it landed on the carpet. Moments after, the guy's Scottie dog scampered into the room and licked it up. I'm still worried I committed an inadvertent act of mild bestiality."
My wife is a hoarder. Our garage is stuffed with random tat. I've made a tidy profit over three lockdowns selling some of this crap on eBay without her knowing. Probably to other hoarders.
I work for Tesco and give the homeless people who sit outside hot drinks from the Costa machine without paying for them. I need my money more than Tesco do.
During lockdown I've ended up with friction burns on my foreskin from all the wanking. I could leave it a couple days and let it heal but instead I've been powering through the pain nightly. Worth it
One time at a gig the music was too loud so I put some tissue in my ears to deaden the sound. Afterwards I couldn't find the one in my right ear so assumed it had fallen out. It finally fell out about 3 years later while I was washing my hair.
"Someone reversed into my car and drove off. No damage, but there was already an existing dent... Managed to track him down and got him to pay £700 to get the old dent sorted believing he'd caused it. I don't feel even slightly guilty, it'll teach him for not stopping to check."
"I shit the bed one night after necking 2 bottles of red wine, I smeared the shit round my then partner's arse, woke them up and shouted at them for shitting themselves."
"When in Uni we lived close to the local Lazertag, and went all the time. One Saturday the two other teams were an 8-year old's birthday party. Of course, we completely blew them to pieces. The birthday boy ended up crying."

"I have a side gig as a freelance proofreader which now makes me more money than my day job. I just accept academic theses to proofread, process them through a machine proofreader and send them back. Last month I made £2400 for 10 minutes' work."
"When my wife goes out for her daily walk I quickly apply garish makeup, strip to my y-fronts and dance around the house in an eighties/robot style to ME by Gary Numan very loud. By the time she gets home I'm back to normal watching the snooker or whatever with tea and biscuits."
I consider myself a foodie but I never know if I can eat the skin on the dry cured sausage. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I don't.
"My wife has a black dress that she wears around the house. I've always hated it, it makes her look like Biffa Bacon's Mutha."
"Once had a 3some with my mate & a girl we met in a club. Was going for it & felt like I was going to chuck my muck, so being the good bloke I am I pulled out & went to throw it over her back. I overshot & my mate had my man fat all over his neck. Still can't look me in the eye."
"Sometimes I get on a train in the back carriage and walk through the length of the train to the front so I can imagine I am an assassin or a spy, looking for a target who is also somewhere on the train."
Used to work in a small shop back in the 90's. A customer gave me a fake pound coin which I refused to accept. He told me to throw it away and paid with a note. I pocketed the £1 and bought my lunch with it.
"Sometimes I go for a poo just three minutes before an important Zoom meeting, with the theme from Mission Impossible playing on my phone"
"When lockdown happened I started counting how many biscuits in a packet so that we could share them out in even quantities. It didn't work, apparently my partner eats biscuits when I am not looking. I think her tiny biscuit heists are adorable, but I would never tell her I know."
"I was fucking gorgeous in my early 30s and had loads of money to spend on clothes etc. I'm 45 now and it's faded but I did use my peak level of attraction to get the loveliest husband going and that hasn't changed at all. Don't waste that time, it is fleeting."
"When I exit the toilet and close the door behind me, I feel like Lord Sugar entering the boardroom."
"The only exercise I have done during lockdown is kegals. I now have a vagina like a fucking snap dragon, capable of breaking any fingers inserted up there. It's an improvement on my physique I can't show off."
I'm always proud when I have a crap so big it blocks the toilet.
"Worked at McDonalds when at college, we used to get boxes and boxes of the Monopoly game cards. We opened around 50% of them ourselves, and got loads of free big mac winners etc, sold them for £1 each at college, made over a grand easily."
I once glued a load of glitter on the underside of my boss's desk and now he keeps muttering about why there's always glitter on this trousers.
"I left a single Mr Kipling lemon slice in the drawer of my desk at work, which I haven't been to since 15th March 2020. I often daydream about what state it's in."
My friend had an ugly baby. I physically couldn't bring myself to purchase the 'Beautiful Baby Boy' card in the shop and had to select another design.

I bite my finger nails off and poke them down the cracks in my living room's wooden floor. I like to think future archaeologists will find them and extract my DNA and clone me.
I once made over a grand on the Bulb referral system by posting my link in multiple Facebook groups. Haven't paid for energy for nearly 18months. I understand this confession is dull as shit.
I once wolf-whistled Anneka Rice and she told me to fuck off. It really made me think.
"Small child in flat above is understandably frustrated about being locked down but gets up at 6am and charges around, approx as loud as a rhino. A courier brought a space hopper to the front door for her so I told him the flat was empty."
"Work offered us the chance to get a monitor, desk, keyboard etc delivered for WFH purposes. I didn't need them but requested them and flogged on local FB group for £300. Hope they don't ask for them back post-pandemic."
"During pretty much every Zoom meeting I am playing a game called Chain Reaction on my laptop. You can download it as an add-on in Chrome, it's simple and silent, I fully recommend it."
My team at work has shrunk so we all have to do our own admin. I have no idea how to raise a PO and no intention of finding out. I've been telling IT there's a problem with my login for months so someone else has to do them.
I administer the WhatsApp group for our estate. The stuck up knob next door is not a member but I created a fake account for him where he's sarcastic and moans about other members. It's all subtle stuff but I'm slowly turning more neighbours against him.
"In middle school I managed to convince everyone that a kid I didn't like had a very small knob. He had a nickname and everything. Sadly, my knob stopped growing that exact day and now I'm 48, I realize I deserved it to turn out this way."
I have a couple of Master's degrees from two world class universities. I've been offered a funded PhD in a competitive field. I've never once in my whole life read an academic article or book all the way through. Not once. Got by on abstracts and summaries. I'm not the only one.
At the start of lockdown my wife started collecting wine bottle corks in a large jar as a silent commentary on my addiction. I only buy screwtop bottles now to try to game the system.
I know I've smoked too much weed when I watch the commercials on my DVR.
"Next door got robbed and the daft sod looked directly at my CCTV twice. I could give them the footage but they kicked off about privacy when I installed it, so can get fucked."
I take one unnecessary journey every day during lockdown.I drive my 3 kids around the block as we listen to Lo Boob Oscillator by Stereolab.They do the ba ba ba boops while I bullshit my way through the French bit.Then they go to bed still doing the ba ba ba boop bit. Sorry cops.
"I accidentally dropped my wife's brand new reed diffuser in the toilet, panicked and fished it out without telling her. What was the smell of zesty grapefruit is now about 80% toilet water."
"Someone gave me a very expensive bottle of claret, which I don't really like, so I added some sugar and now it's drinkable. Just."
"When I was younger, I worked for a popular British retailer who later went bankrupt. I nicked thousands of pounds worth of CDs and computer games and fear I may have contributed to their demise."

Since lockdown #2 my girlfriends 23 year old sister has been staying with us. She has featured in all of my sex dreams to the point now where I can't look her in the eye.
Ridiculous numbers of friends have got a puppy during the last year. I despise the way they signed their Christmas cards with the stupid mutt's name. I can't stand dogs.
One day I took a shit that was so big it ruptured my Sphincter. I'm waiting for an operation so I'm wearing adult nappies. Luckily I'm working from home so not an issue. I'm dreading going back.
I've tried several sorts of whisky at wildly differing price points but I don't like it. It fucking stinks.
"When the husband and I have sex, we have to make sure the bedroom door is closed, otherwise the cat walks in and looks at us, it's off putting and weird."
"I was having a vigorous wank to some VR porn, the scene was in doggy style so I was standing over the spare bed, when I came I failed to catch my ejaculation and spunked over the cat"
"I'm a woman in my mid 30's and while I've always been very sexual, I've been basically unable to think about anything else for the last couple of years. Suspect I'm wasting my sexual peak being married."
I once caused a riot at a football game by calling a man holding his son's hand a paedo
Nine months ago I confessed on here that I hoped the puppy my wife and kids convinced me to get would somehow be taken by an owl whilst having a 3am shit. I now confess I love the little twat with all my heart.
I tell everyone my favourite food is venison. In reality it's jacket potato.
"Working in an airport bar, I once went in to the back to get stock, & I put my penis in to a very famous uefa officials drink because of some ridiculous & offensive things he'd been saying. He's someone that often comes with the tagline disgraced & 15 years on I regret nothing"
"The best thing about working from 🏠 is bringing a ☕️ with me to the 🚽 when going for a 💩. Or sometimes bringing a 🍺, if I'm honest."
My fella thinks that showing me his cock constitutes foreplay. Like I'm supposed to be driven wild by the mere sight of it. Sorry sunshine. Going to have to work harder than that.
"Once used a tube of fart putty as a flashlight, realistic queef sounds happened"
"Love it when it snows heavily; kids out all day building snowmen, and me out all evening walking around the estate knocking them all down, win win"
I always get my husband to ring up stores or restaurants or hotels if we have a question. I wait till he's really in the flow of the conversation before shouting show us your cock at the top of my voice. Every time.
I put my flatmate's frozen sausages up my arse because they take the piss out of me being vegetarian
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something horrible to Adolf Hitler?
I bought a Fitbit but to be honest the only time it's been useful was when I used the magnet to check which of my pans would work on my new induction hob.
I stuck googly eyes either side of my todger to see If I could train my phone to use my cock and balls for face recognition. It didn't work. Lockdown science: I do these things so you don't have to.
"I love buying Pokémon cards, but my fiancée hates that I do. Because I am the one going to the supermarket these days, I buy loads there, open them in the car and bin the packaging in the bin outside ASDA. It feels like an addiction. I have loads upstairs."
"Despite the global pandemic and the roads are snowed in, I phoned Co-op deliveries customer service to complain that I got charged for asparagus I didn't get, and they replaced my Dijon mustard with Hollandaise sauce. I feel like a proper priveledged twat."
"My neighbour asked me to look after her cats while on holiday. I had to give daily injections to the one that had diabetes. I injected the wrong cat. Can't bear to write how this ended, I think you all know. I'm sorry."
When I had kids I didn't foresee the amount of time I'd spend removing a congealed mass of long hair and semen from the shower drain. Teenagers are disgusting creatures and I can't wait until they move out.
I am a Catholic priest. I do not even have the slightest sexual attraction to children. I feel like such a fraud.
"Have literally been to every porn category and back a million times now: lesbian, scat, transgender, gay, back to milfs and anything in between. Really struggle to get off to anything anymore. Think I've completed it."
"I knew deep down that Morrissey was a wrong 'un going back to the latter days of the Smiths, but for 25 years I justified his bullshit by telling myself he was just a bit nostalgic and misunderstood, until I couldn't defend the fucker any longer. I'm ashamed of myself."
"Got v high on a night out, went for a walk to calm down and found myself outside Boris Johnson's old house in Islington. I urinated all over the front door and then went back to the pub."
Sometimes I like to sit sideways on the toilet just to feel a hint of danger.
When I buy eggs I always open the carton to check for broken ones. I've never found one. Always feel slightly let down. One day all my work will pay off. I can't wait
"I'm always depressed. Once a year the doctor asks if I'm depressed and I say, No. because I don't want them to put in some sort of psychiatric hospital."
"After two weeks I broke it off with a girl using the it's not you, it's me approach; told her she was great and should never change but the truth is she'd asked me twice if I'd help her break into her ex's house because he owed her money and I was petrified of her."
"Thanks to Lockdown, I have not worn deodorant since Monday 23rd March 2020. Although I stink, I have saved £12.90"
I sometimes can't be bothered to unload and put away all the bits from the dishwasher. So I put away some stuff and then leave the rest in so it goes through again and then my missus has to put it away when she unloads it
I read every name backwards to the point of driving myself insane. For example Windows XP is PX Swodniw.

I used to work in first class for British Airways. A customer poured wine down my leg so I put bogies in their food
I never pre heat my fucking oven. I just cook things a bit longer if needed.
"I'm secretly loving these lockdowns, means I don't have to do shit like going to farms with the Mrs and kids at the weekends. I can't just sit on my arse and drink beer it's great"
Honestly just have myself a paper cut wiping my arse. Fuck you Andrex
I'm taking a bit longer in the bathroom right now as I can hear my wife has decided to change the bed. No chance am I getting dragged in to helping her with that
When I stay in nice hotels I like to play knock-down-ginger in the early hours of the morning.
"Whenever I am asked to take a picture of a stranger at tourist landmark, I point the phone at them and take a selfie instead. I then press the home button, hand them back the phone and scuttle off before they realise."
"I borrowed a C15 cassette with a game on it from someone at school. By mistake I taped the chart rundown from TOTP over it. So I made a basic picture and saved a basic load/run routine, except that it now said Horace goes wanking and then R Tape Loading Error. He never noticed"
I get scared when the vegetables in my kitchen start to sprout. Onions and potatoes particularly terrify me. It's like there are living things in my house and they're coming to get me. I'm a scientist in my early 40s.
"Whenever I get my kids dressed in their pyjamas I pull their trousers up so the waist is up by their chest. They look like little old men, they don't understand why I find it so funny. Nor to I, tbh."
I am a HGV driver. My steering wheel has 17 buttons. I know what two of them do!!
"To impress trendy twats, I used to tell people that I thought Midge Ure ruined Ultravox and that John Foxx was a much better front man. Really though I thought that John Foxx era Ultravox was a load of pretentious wank and they improved vastly after Midge joined. Sorry Midge!"
"NOTE FROM ADMIN: We've just rejigged @swearclock to work more like @fesshole so that you can add sweary things and the moderated ones will tweet out as a time-check. If you want user-generated sweary time, FOLLOW @swearclock NOW!"
"Obsessed with fossils as a child, my cousin and I found some fossilised turtle dung in a museum shop. Determined to make our own, we shat in a bucket and put it in the airing cupboard-after all, it dried out wet clothes. After a couple of hours the smell of warm shit was choking"
"I was at a supermarket, and was about to enter my car reg into the Parking Eye machine when an obnoxious old man barged past me and got there first. He left before confirming his car details. It asked Is this your car? I duly replied with No. He'll have got a ticket. Good."
"Aged 9, Me and a friend were rolling down a hill for fun. I rolled through a patch of stinging nettles. My friend followed after me and rather than tell him to stop, I shouted keep going so I wasn't the only one in pain. He only had shorts on, I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt."
"One of the best things about having teenage kids is that they can put you in touch with the local weed dealers - so you can start smoking again, after quitting when you first had kids."
It's the circle of life.
I was recently in a virtual audience at the recording of a radio comedy show. I was chuffed because I seemed to be getting the jokes way before the rest of the audience. Then I realised that there is a zoom delay. Chump.

"Fed up of photos taken on people's walks, like they have just invented both nature and walking. Fuck off, you boring twats"
I get so much pleasure from farting on the stairs then walking back down through the fart cloud. I anonymously recommend it to everyone
For nearly six years I had two consulting contracts running simultaneously with the same company. I was paid twice for the one eight hour day.
"I'm married, late-30s but I live a secret life in my head where I'm actually Lady Gaga's husband. She's Stephanie to me, obvs. I keep a low profile but am supportive and affirming, gently helping her shape her career. She's tactile, witty, bright and amazing in bed."
My cousin recently died of heart complications. I was looking through my texts today and realized the last thing I ever said to him before he died was you look like a fucking muppet
I think I might have worms. I am not going to see my doctor as it seems like a handy way to lose the lockdown pounds.
"Since living on my own and working from home in the pandemic, I've become almost a full-time nudist. I only wear clothes when I need to go to the shops. It's very satisfying, and I hate the thought of going back to my previous, regularly-clothed existence."
Whenever I see a girl called 'Alexa' on a dating app I swipe left without thinking. If it went well and she moved in I'd have to rename all my Echos and that's too much work.
"I agreed with my wife to get rid of the TV to 'free us from the tyranny of the box' knowing full well that she'd give in within a month and let me buy an even bigger better one. I worship you, oh mighty box."
"When someone puts up a picture of their legs in the bath I absolutley always screen shot it. Taps are chrome like a mirror and if you zoom in and play around with the light levels, more oftern than not you can see everything."
"When my neighbor treated their dog badly, beating, left outside, no food. I stole it and gave it to my brother and his family where it has lived a perfect life."
Guy at work who had the locker next to me was really cocky and annoying. He never locked his locker as he only kept his overalls in it. When he pissed me off I'd swap them for the next size down.
I hate housework so much I drop an e once a week and absolutely blitz it. Often get compliments on how clean it looks.
I once found nearly a thousand bucks I. A ziplock bag stuffed between the seats on the train. Bought a new PC with it. No regrets but every now and then I get nervous that whoever that money was meant for might one day come for me.
When I go for a piss I like to make an 'ok' sign with my fingers around the piss stream. I hold it there as long as I can. If I get piss on my fingers I lose.
"When I get bored and feel like an argument online, I write Stolen under bikes for sale listings locally."
As a kid I used to share an advent calendar with my little brother each year. I always used to let him go first and open door number 1. My parents thought I was being kind but everyone knows if you go second you end up with the big chocolate on Christmas Eve

"I find that I need to be at least three joints in before homeschooling my five yr old twins. Fuck knows what the teacher needs with 25+ plus of them for five hours a day, the poor bastards. They deserve fucking medals. And free weed."
If an eBay purchase comes wrapped in The Daily Mail I always report it as broken on arrival or if untracked-lost. Less money for the seller to give to UKIP
"After a bout of diarrhea I developed what felt like massive piles. I wanted to see, but mirrors were too difficult to organise. So, I set the timer on my phone camera & bent over. I don't know what I was expecting tbh...but it was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life."
I have oily skin and love the smell of my face grease. After a long day I'll wipe my face with my hands and just inhale the aroma. Its especially nice the day after a kebab -gives it a nice oniony/garlicky taint
When we were younger and on a coke bender me and my wife when fucking would lick the inside of each others nostrils for every last bit of marching powder. We are old and boring now. Miss those times.
I once coughed up a golf ball sized mass of thick green phlegm. It hit my hand like a tennis ball and looked like a brain. I was walking to a pub with a guy I fancied so I discreetly ditched it...still regret not keeping it.
In 2005 a week before Christmas I stuck my hand through a letterbox attached to the local church and found a Christmas card with £20 inside. I went straight into town and spent it on wrestling figures.
I am secretly pleased when a pack of bacon goes unnoticed in our fridge and goes out of date. No one else will eat it so I get the full pack to myself. Had one yesterday which was 3 weeks over. I had multiple bacon & mushroom rolls and the dog got a piece too
Since I quit smoking and my sense of smell has improved I have noticed my farts are more pungent. I'm worried that when my wife quits she'll notice and leave me
"When I go on my turbo trainer, I empty some of my water bottle onto the floor to make it look like I've sweated just a little bit more. I live alone."
"I hate washing socks, so I just put them in the bin and buy news ones, don't really care what anyone thinks about this"
"I'm a reasonably calm middle aged bloke, but nothing makes me want to smash the whole fucking world up more than trying to remember and enter a password."
"I am using a 2011 Mac Mini for work because I feel sorry for it. It has been shelved for years, never got to fulfil its destiny. It's fine for what I do. A newer model now sits on the shelf."
"I frequently turn my 2yo daughter upside down to dry her hair with the hairdryer. She can't run off, it dries more quickly, and she ends up with the same hairstyle as Faye from Steps."
"When my 17yo stepson is engrossed in an 'important' game of WoW, I like to remotely reboot the router."
"My car recently passed 50,000 miles on the clock, so I filled it up with premium diesel as a special treat"
"Worked at an ISP in the late 90's - found a sex-chat log of a tech-support bod. Messaged him a new login for the woman. He turns up and connects - spends nearly an hour chatting filth with 5 of us instead. Finishing, we say turn & wave, Alex!. He left shortly after."

"When my kids were about 3 I would pretend to be a sleeping monster and they had to climb on me without waking the monster. Meant I could rest on the floor, eyes closed, and still always know where they were, that they were safe, and all I had to do was growl every few minutes"
"My ex doesn't know I still have a Nectar card for their account. I love it when Sainsburys have a sale and I can buy something decent using their points. So far I've had a new iron, a beard trimmer and a nutri bullet for free."
I got my debit card replaced recently and the CCV number on the back of the new one is 666. This amuses me no end. Every time I use it to buy something over the phone I mutter Hail Satan! afterwards and have a chuckle.
As I've gotten older I've realised I don't love my parents. I've not seen them for a year because of lockdown and I don't miss them in my life one bit.
"Anal building site foreman used a dial-lock on the old-style pulse telephone. We knew you could lift the handset and dial any number by tapping the contacts. We took turns tapping 144, replacing the handset and watching the foreman trudge across the site to 'answer' the phone."
At last years Christmas party a co worker spent the evening chatting with me and literally holding my crotch. She then came back to my hotel room and it took every ounce of will power for me to kick her out because I'm in a relationship. I still use it as wank material.
Sometimes when washing my hands I like to turn on the hot water only and see how long I can leave my hands in the water before the pain becomes too much. I don't know why I do this.
I told people I didn't attend my friend's online funeral because it felt uncomfortably voyeuristic. I'd just forgotten about it.
"I found a semen stained tea towel in a colleague's car. I gleefully told all our workmates that the guy loved to knock one out in lay bys. 2 yrs later, all was revealed at a drive thru maccies when he used the towel to stop spills. Sorry, 'Wanker-John' as he had become known."
"I am married with three teenage kids. I often fantasise about living in a flat, just me and my favourite cat. I think about decor and furniture and the quiet. It would be bliss."
I use the World at War to help me get to sleep there's something just so soporific about Larry Olivier describing genocide
"As a child I wrote to Jim'll Fix It, asking if he could fix it for me to be shot in the hand. No reply."
"If someone asks me the time, I always say Chico Time. Always. No one ever laughs, but I still do it."
I bought a fingerprint kit off Amazon during a crime documentary binge. I started collecting the prints of any friends or family who came over as a bit of fun but it's become a compulsion. Got the gas mans the other day
"Whenever I'm finished in the shower and call my wife to tell her the bathroom's free, I always continue in my head: ...unlike the country under the Thatcherite junta in the style of Rick from the Young Ones"
When websites ask for age verification I always put my date of birth as September 11th 2001. It's memorable.
"I had a wank with Fairy Liquid once, was probably the best wank of my life, until I woke up the next morning with the skin on my shaft and balls peeling and as sore as a baboons ass."

I regularly stalk a girl on Instagram just to see how fat she is. My ex cheated with her - I walked in on her giving him a tit wank at a party - she was slim with great boobs and now she's just a unit.
I couldn't bring myself to dump my girlfriend and feel like the bad guy so I took up blowing a referee whistle constantly around the flat until she left of her own accord

"My wife insists that the perfect 'stewing' time for a cup of tea is 3 minutes and will set this amount of time on the cooker, then take out the teabag when it beeps. I always set it for 1 minute then give it extra squeezes. Never notices the difference."
"Mum, please stop using those toilet bowl cleaners. It froths up the water and means I can't inspect my poop creations."
A senior boss had a habit of continuing high level phone conferences in the toilet. If I was in one of the cubicles I'd simulate farts and make pained straining noises loud enough to be heard over the phone.
"My other half a little bit Tory. This bothers me, so I sign every single petition that does good in his name. No idea if he knows, but always makes me smile."
"When I empty the coffee filter, I like to bang it against the sides of the bin to the rhythm of the intro to Blue Monday by New Order."
"I've just had a flashback to when I was a very young kid I used to scrape chewing gum off the floor and eat it. I think, quite rightly, I repressed it. The thought of it is making want to vomit."
"Been married 4 years now. My life is so empty - work, walk the dog, have dinner, watch telly, go to bed and repeat. Occasionally we go to Homebase. God I miss cocaine and shagging randomers on nights out."
"When I turn my tv off at night, I make sure it's on BBC1 so when it's next turned on, you won't know I was watching ITV2 or 5 USA. I live alone."
I was in my early 20s before I realised crack whores had a drug habit and weren't the best at doing their job.
"While sat here working from home with my music on I imagine I am playing piano or keyboards in front of thousands. Quite often I will turn, hold out my mic - pen - and let 'them' sing the chorus before carrying on playing."
"I used to poo so many times behind a garden hedge I used to leave toilet roll in a plastic bag there. One night, after about four months of shitting there, I was lit up by a security light they had fitted & the bloke chased me up the road."
"I sold my house to a Birmingham City supporter. I lined the loft floor with old Aston Villa programmes so every time he is in bed, they are staring down at him, gloating. He is totally unaware."
My BF keeps his t-shirt on when we have sex. I love him so much and fancy the arse off him and would love him to feel comfortable with his own body. The 'Donald Duck' look doesn't especially do it for me but I don't want to raise the subject and make him more self conscious.
"After 12 years married and 2 kids together our sex life had hit the rocks. I bought the wife a womaniser toy to try spice things up. now our sex life is better than ever. This is not a confession, just advice for those in a similar situation"

If I get a swearword in Scrabble I have to play it even if I could get a better score.
I love my wife with all my heart but her wilful disregard for what is and isn't dishwasher safe is tearing us apart.
"Once when I was tripping my tits off on ecstasy, I realised I didn't have my wallet on me so I gave a taxi driver a blowjob for driving me home."
Being stuck in isolation has just highlighted the fact I really really dislike my husband.
"In primary school I convinced one of the younger kids to eat dozens of berries off one of the trees. I never saw him again after that day, and still wonder if I poisoned him to death."
My mum regularly texts me the crossword clues she can't get in the express on Sunday... I always google them and reply quickly pretending I knew... she thinks I'm a genius.
"If the dog knew that I trick him by feeding him quorn nuggets instead of chicken nuggets he'd probably tear my throat out. Luckily he has dementia, so that'll never happen."
"There's a cavity in the back of one of my teeth, I use it to store bogeys that I might want to chew on later"
"Due to the roads being very quiet during lockdown, it's enabled me to get some very good lap times in on the local ring road after i drop my wife off at work. It's the closest i get to a bit of excitement these days."
"Around 2010, I had a one night stand after a coke fuelled binge. We tried anal. Nobody tells you how much lube is needed but it's a LOT. In my passed out and gaping sleep I must have shat the bed. Mortified, I snuck out at 6am. I live in constant fear of bumping into him."
"Every time I listen to music that I like, I imagine that I'm introducing it to a resurrected Mozart or Beethoven. Trying to sell Napalm Death to Mozart really makes you think about why you like it."
"I can't be bothered to go upstairs just for a wee, but my kitchen sink is too high to reach. Then it hit me. The dishwasher has a drain so now I just piss in there."
"I made loadsamoney in the late 80s by putting tin foil around 10p pieces, putting them in London Underground ticket machines, pressing cancel and getting 50p coins back. Sorry to anyone who got a 10p+the foil from a club biscuit instead of 50p as change & for wiping poo onto them"
"Back in the 80's Me & me mate used to record ourselves swearing our fuckin heads off on a cassette tape but we'd leave about a minute silence at the start. Then we'd go to Boots or Woolies where they had the hi-fi stuff, put the tape in, turn it up to full, press play and leggit."
"I'll retire from the police in a couple of years, once the money is in the bank I'm going to try my hand at some minor shoplifting."
"My wife says jacket potatoes are a main course, I say a side dish. I will literally cook one chicken nugget each to win the right to call a jacket potato a side dish."
When I found out my wife was having an affair I had to pretend I cared more than I did. The truth is I wasn't that bothered.

Been saying vica versa all my life but predictive text tells me that this is wrong. Sounds better than vice-versa tho to be fair
"My daughter spent all her pocket money on buying my husband a really special mug for Christmas. When I make the tea I always give myself that mug, not him. No one's even noticed. I know I should stop but I just can't."
I inserted a vibrating egg in my ass but was unable to retrieve it. I had to wait 3 hours for the battery to die before going to A&E.
"We live in a first floor flat. Sometimes I throw my daughter's poo-filled nappies out the window and into the communal bin below, rather than go all the way to the bathroom to use our nappy bin!"
"I work in an adult store. After close I use the toys, clean them and put them back on the shelf."
"20 years ago I walked-in on my big brother and his girlfriend whilst they were mid 69. He lifted his head from his station and looked me right in the eye. They're married with kids now and I eye avoid eye contact. We've never discussed it, but I can just tell it haunts them too."
"Last year in preparation for Brexit our EU orders, which made up 80% of our business, dried up. Luckily Covid came along and we were able to put many staff on furlough instead of making them redundant."
"Since we got a dog, I've become aware that my own poo varies in quite a similar way to the dog's. Sometimes it's extra smelly, sometimes paler, sometimes sludgier."
I just got a positive covid test and don't know whether to include my dealer in my contact tracing
"I enjoy following my old university's alumni group on Facebook, but only so that I can see how badly some of my peers have aged. Particularly those who were considered great beauties as students but to whom time has not been kind. I'm doing okay by comparison!"
"My wife thinks I'm highly virtuous, doing my 10k steps a day. What she doesn't know is that my pedometer mistakes wanking for walking."
When I'm alone in the house and need some relief I stream a recent Nigella episode close my eyes and pretend that Margaret Thatcher is seducing me with her cooking skills
When I was a teenager I loved the Manics. To help them sell more singles I made a small flyer of a single to be released and put it in with my leaflets and newspapers when I did my paper round hoping to get people to buy it. The song was ' Let Robeson Sing' and it charted top 20.
When I was in a band at school I recorded an Deep Purple song and told my mum it was me. She still thinks it was me. I'm 46 this year.
"I cheated in my Physics O Level. Sat to the left of a lad who was a total swot and copied everyone of his multiple choice answers from start to finish. Got a C, not sorry."
As a teenager I made up that a girl at a local school was into scat for no reason. I didn't know her and I certainly didn't know anything about her sex life. The lie spread and she is still well known in the area for it. The guilt will never leave me.
"Living at home in the 90s, before I'd have a wank I'd do a quick check for hidden cameras. Didn't want Noel Edmunds' crew on Noels House Party getting footage of me wacking off."

People think my wife is sweetly bringing me tea while on work calls. Really she's dropping silent but violent farts.
Some months ago someone came of here and claimed to have done a 2.2kg shit. I recently tried to beat that by only eating porridge for a week and holding it in. Just got back from hospital after an excruciating irrigation and only 1.8 kg lighter. Gutted.
Soon into the first lockdown I made the decision not to trim my pubes as an experiment. I now have an enormous bush and spend more time brushing it than I do my hair. I love it. Dreading when I get laid again and inevitably have to trim beforehand.
"I can't think of the title of the new Disney+ show, WandaVision, without singing it in my head to the ChuckleVision theme"
"Today, I was home schooling my son; I learned how to use a semicolon. I'm 44."
"Grandad brought back insane amount of Nazi stuff from the war. Sold most of it now. 9/10 items go to America and around 80% get seized by US customs. We keep the money regardless. It's paying for Grandad's remaining years in comfort. Stay racist USA, it's good for grandad."
"Hate going to to the supermarket because of covid, seemingly don't have a problem with my Albanian coke dealer and whereever he's been in his car for the rest of the day."
"On the 8th of August 1995 I failed my driving test. There were many reasons, but one was that I though you had to do a complete lap of a roundabout before exiting."
I always use the butter that's got all the crumbs in it when I'm making the kids sandwiches
Just paid the bank an extra $600 so my outstanding mortgage balance is now $123456.78
I've lived in this house for three years and have yet to use my hands to open the bottom kitchen drawer. I'm far too adept at using my feet like monkey claws
"I bought a doer-upper house, my partner moved in bring a set of horrible shaped mugs with her. I now only give workmen tea in those mugs in hope they will accidentally break them."
"In primary school, I was asked to look after a visiting non English speaking pupil for an hour. I taught him how to say 'fuck', 'wank' and 'shit'. I thought it would not be appropriate to teach him 'cunt'. My mate Simon did that."
My first name is Alex but one of the funny lads in the group christened me Alan and now it's stuck. They refuse to use my legal name and is causing me a lot of upset. I hate him.
"My wife gets annoyed if you leave the kitchen light on, but always leaves the bathroom light on. I get annoyed by the bathroom light but always leave the kitchen light on.I'm 90% certain we're both doing it to annoy the other. Keeps the marriage fresh."
I circle Wally in any Where's Wally book I find in public areas
"I'm a graphic designer for a company you've probably shopped with. Recently, I've been splicing single frames of giant cocks into our online videos and animations, Tyler Durden-style. AFAIK, no one's noticed yet."

"I'm a professional baker. I spend my days baking Sourdoughs and Wholegrain loaves, but then get back home and smash through half a loaf of Warburtons Toastie. Best bread ever."
Did a naked photoshoot as a work favour to a crush in some fields 10 years ago. Basically me rolling haystacks and smelling flowers with my knob out. I only agreed as I thought we'd hook up but all that happened is those photos are on the internet forever and we no longer talk.
"Every day between my morning poo and my shower I do an impression of an 80's / 90's wrestler in the mirror, maybe a Hulk Hogan ear cup, a randy savage twirl or if I feel I really need it a silent Ric Flair woooooo!"
During lockdown and with my bf stuck in Japan I gave in and fucked my flat mate. I did the dropping of the towel accidentally walking out of the bathroom routine. He undid his jeans and came in me in about 15 seconds. Still haven't seen the bf yet. Still fucking my flat mate.
"Somehow my 15 year old daughters Spotify is linked to my new phone. She can be extremely rude at times, which makes pausing and muting her music at night all the more satisfying, she has no idea why its happening."
Failure to tidy up properly after a self pleasuring session led to my mother trying to sanitise her hands with lube.
"Jeremy Beadle's house was on my walk to school. He nearly ran me over once, so I took revenge by stealing the orange juice from his milk delivery every week for a year."
"Bloke opposite had a go at me for putting my recycling overflow in the normal bin after Christmas. Mate, you've got 7 kids so wind your fucking neck in when it comes to the environment."
"When de-scaling the kettle I accidentally got a little of the liquid on my thumb and, by instinct, licked it clean. Immediately my mouth knew this was wrong. The packaging said to phone poison control straight away, but I was worried they'd think I was an idiot. I survived."
"Once a month, I feed my houseplants with my collected menstrual blood. The trick is to use 1 part blood to 10 parts water and mix it together so it looks like cranberry juice. That way it soaks all the way into the soil."
My wife has changed the position of her computer and people on zoom calls can no longer see our living room. I celebrate this by doing a willy helicopters whilst she's in meetings with her boss.
"At least once a month I wake up convinced I've killed someone or helped cover up a killing and the police have found out. More worried about the police than the killing bit, which makes me worried it might be a real, repressed memory."
When I put one of the capsules into my Nespresso machine I pretend that I'm loading an artillery shell into the breach of a gun. If no one is around I say FIRING and then make a BOOM sound when I press the brew button.
When i was a much younger man i pulled a girl i'd fancied for ages. We had a few dates and things eventually got steamy. I desperately wanted to please her so used a delay spray. She gave me a BJ and then freaked out as half her face went numb. Probably never given a BJ since.
I'm dating several men. None of them know about the others. They all think they are the only one. They don't seem to suspect and I respect them less for thinking women don't just use men for sex. Fuck them all.
"During lockdown I've taken up doing yoga via YouTube videos. A side benefit is getting fitter, but mostly it's so I can stare at the instructor's bum for 20 minutes straight without the wife getting suspicious."
"10 years or so ago I acquired 10 Bitcoin. I have no idea where it is. I think it is lost on an old computer I no longer have. It would currently be worth £250,000. I stay awake at night feeling sick."

I don't live in the UK so we don't get Nigel Farage on TV. I don't know how his name is pronounced so I assume it rhymes with cabbage.
"As a kid, I climbed on the school roof and smashed a load of roof tiles for no particular reason. I confessed it to my mum when I was drunk int 20s. The look of disappointment still lives with me now."
Occasionally i'll drop a couple of cat treats in my husband's smoothie. Cat vitamins.
"As far as my boss is aware, my father in law has been in and out of hospital for the last 6 months and I've had to take a lot of paid time off work to take him - he died 5 years ago"
Like most average looking people I've always been slightly irritated at fit girls/lads not even bothering to message back on Tinder/Grindr. Curiously created fakes fit profiles during lockdown to see what it's like and can safely say I've got newfound respect and understand now.
"I once called someone a cunt for slightly outbidding me on ebay. You can no longer contact other bidders, I'd like to think I contributed to that."
"My wife thinks I do the washing up out of the goodness of my heart. Truth is she's shit at washing up and leaves crap caked on 'clean' plates, pans and cutlery so I'd rather do it than risk some sort of food poisoning"
"Years ago, after a night out me and a mate ripped down an N, U, L and A from the sign of the local curry house called The Peninsula. Still got the A."
"Every time I do a click and collect at Asda I request a refund for damaged goods. Sometimes it's just a bit of veg, sometimes expensive cheese, occasionally meat. They agree the refund almost instantly. It's the easiest shoplifting ever."
"When I'm doing some coke I tend to use a plate I got from my grandparents they had on their best table before they died, really brings me closer to them and their memory"
"Having spent the 90s wanking over Carol Vorderman but not owning a video recorder, I still get a bit of a twitch if I see a picture of Richard Whiteley."
If I'm enjoying a podcast I like to rate it 1 star on the app as I don't want them to get cocky.
"The more I think about it, I don't think my parents taught me any life skills at all. Not washing, ironing, cooking, DIY or anything. Thank fuck for YouTube."
It was with a heavy heart today that I relegated my tin opener to the third drawer down. He's had a good innings but he's simply not pulling his weight any more. I hope the rolling pin and ice cream scoop will be his friends.
"A hot girl stopped me in the supermarket and asked if I was wearing new jeans. 'Hey, still got it,' I thought. Turned out I'd left the transparent tape with M M M M M M down the leg. She found it highly amusing."
"I used to buy only organic food for my baby until it turned out she eats like a horse and refuses almost everything except salmon, avocado and passion fruits. Now she gets the pesticide-ridden stuff until she starts paying her own way"
During lockdown I've started a project to see how long I can grow my toenails. I want to finish up as Mr Toe-Claw Man. May have to stop wearing shoes at some point but who cares?

"Instead of clapping for our NHS workers, me and my housemates crank up the volume on our speakers and blast Steve Reich's 'Clapping Music' out into the street."
"I don't like alcohol, never have. My friends and family praise me for not being a drinker. I'm actually a high-functioning heroin addict. Feel that would be a bit of a conversation stopper though so I've never brought it up."
"When I'm selling something on facebook, I'll always give first dibs to someone if they're fit. Sometimes I'll accept a lower offer"
I don't care what you say. Affairs are the best sex.
"I like to pretend I've met celebrities and say they're remarkably different to their public personas. Eg. 'That Farage is actually a quiet, humble person'."
I'm in my 30s. I have to tuck my pajama pants into my socks at night so the ghosts don't get in.
What will ghosts do to my legs if they get in? I don't know and I don't want to find out.
"I once went on a drink and coke bender the night before I had to take my kids to the theatre to see Alice in Wonderland. We were in the front row and I fell asleep at the start of the second act, and got a telling off from the Queen of Hearts from the stage, mid performance."
"I've taught my disabled son to key every car we pass which is parked blocking the pavement or at a dropped kerb. He's an adult, but not legally liable and neither am I for him. He can do every panel in one go as we wheel past. Serves them right, selfish pricks."
"One of the lads from work lives in the flats next door to me, he doesn't know I secretly race him home after work. If he beats me, I make him do the work no wants to do the next day. I'm the senior manager for the department."
"I'm sick and tired of my kids putting their movies, telly shows and music on the TV. Children are rubbish and they like shit things."
"Last week in the supermarket, I needed 2 large baking potatoes. In the container, there were 3 left: 2 big ones and a very tiny one. I bought all 3 because I didn't want the tiny one to be lonely."
"I've ruined countless wedding day guest books by either drawing a cock with machine gun spunk that runs on for several pages, or a stick man throwing up with the message thanks for the food."
My phone is quite old. I got a little bit excited the other day when I thought I would be able to justify a replacement when I saw a crack in the screen. My disappointment was real when I realised it was just a huge hair sticking out of my finger.
"I love doing Lego with my six year old, but I feel guilty as I have to take charge of the best bit, which is the application of stickers. His technique is appalling and I can't let wonky stickers slide."
"I'm tall. Whenever I see a guy shorter than me who's been working out and showing off his muscles, I focus my gaze over his head so he feels short."
"You can get big, but you'll always be short."
I knew someone was pinching my fags from my desk so I put 2 or 3 match ends in each of the cigs and waited to watch one explode when the stolen item was lit. No injury but they did almost soil themselves.
"Every 2 months I present jars of my homemade preserves to coworkers. Chutney, jam, marmalade etc, with my own labels. Now have reputation as master preserver. They don't know my friend constantly gives me huge jars of the stuff. I repot into smaller jars, pretend I made them."

At a sleepover at a friend's house in 2008 I ordered porn using the default pin code '1234' on the sky box totalling £37.99. My friend's dad had to move out at the end of the month and they never got back together. I had a fabulous wank though so it was worth it.
The Queen was quite a looker in her day as old 50p coins are testament to. Who knew the holiday fund coin jar was such a source of wank material.
People that make fake whiplash claims are fucking trash.Then I was in the teeniest bump two years ago. Got £1600. My husband got £1500. We had a lovely holiday. I wish I felt guilty. I don't.
"Whenever my wife is taking a shit, I like to sing I hear your poop fall down' to the tune of Informer by Snow."
"Lockdown has made me realise how boring I must be. Not seeing people and closing pubs, restaurants, gyms, cinemas, theatres etc as made no impact on my life whatsoever."
"When in a meeting with a lot of people I often look around the room and decide which order I would choose if I had to have sex with everyone, women and men. It's less appealing now we're all on Zoom calls as I can just play games phone if I'm bored."
"I once had a semi-serious agreement with a friend that if we were both single when I turned 50 we'd get married. I'm turning 50 soon and neither of us are single, but good God I wish we were."
"Since marrying my husband 10 yrs ago, he has put on weight. He's plump now. I am not. I love him, but his fat is unattractive. Married men who complain about lack of sex - check your weight."
I just had to use anti-fungal cream. Under my tits.
I haven't had my hair cut since before the first lockdown. In that time I've incrementally moved my parting from right to left. Today my wife of 5 years noticed. I told her it's always been this way and she dropped it
A long term friend of mine swore me to secrecy when he told me he and his wife had started swinging and how amazing it was. Didn't have the heart to tell him I'd been doing it for the last 6 years and dreading bumping into them at some point.
"I was angry that my ex mother-in-law was my late partners next of kin, but now, with all the debt collectors coming after my late partner, it's nice to send them in her direction."
"I once tried the popcorn trick at the cinema, didn't really work out, I just ended up getting salt stinging my japs eye"
"I keep a litre milk container in the spare room, so I don't have to go through the agony of holding a massive piss in whilst the other half is merrily singing in the bath for an hour. I can't be the only one..."
"I am a lecturer at a top 5 university. When I write references for my often very rich students and I see their addresses, I look up where they live on GoogleEarth and get jealous of their lovely houses."
"I regularly blow my nose on dirty tshirts if I can't be bothered to get a tissue. It cleans out in the wash, it's just mucuus from my own body and I don't find it completely disgusting or dirty."
"It was my 1st week at university halls and I was too scared to go to the communal loo because people could hear, so I thought I'd use my sink. Didn't realise my diarrhoea would block it up and I'd have to use my toothbrush to force it down the hole"

"Since COVID I stopped bothering to cut my previously very short hair. I've just realised my hair makes me look like Perry Grayson. I like Perry, but you've got to admit he's got a shit haircut."
"I love the smell of my own stinky armpits, Lefty and Righty have different smell profiles"
I had a skype interview with a company for a job that I didn't want so I put on a fake irish accent. I've just passed my three months probation and the accent hasn't slipped yet.
"I've been in a relationship for five years and we're now engaged, but I can't stop thinking about a girl who ghosted me about seven years ago. She just vanished completely, no social media or anything and it really bothers me."
I teach secondary English. I silently scream in the stationery cupboard when the children won't shut up.
"I used to go to the deli counter of a local supermarket for lunch, and used to get a spicy chicken wrap. One lady serving on the counter always used 2 fillets instead of 1. I would hang back and observe, then insert myself into the queue so that I would almost always get her."
"I have never opened a voice mail. I know how, I just can't be arsed."
"When an online form asks for my email, and then for me to confirm my email in a second box, I just copy and paste from the first box, thus replicating any original typing error and negating the whole purpose of having the second box in the first place."
I've taken to filling a bottle of beer with water or tea for Zoom Drinks because I've found it tons easier than having the unavoidable why aren't you drinking? conversation. I hate that socialising in Britain is so linked to drinking.
"When I was 18 I worked part time for McVitie in their PR department in Admin, when we were bored we used to send emails to customer mailing lists telling them Jaffa cakes were in fact a Cake or Biscuit and to ignore all previous guidance... I got let go after 8 months."
"As a tradesman, especially in winter, I hate it when you hear a customers kettle boil & they don't ask you if you want a hot drink. I don't actually want one, but it would be nice to ask. Arseholes."
I'm ugly. I hate it. Beautiful people try to make me feel better with empty platitudes like You have a good face. Oh yeah? Really? COME AND SIT ON IT THEN.
"I'm very fortunate to have a 'girl next door' look going. Whenever I get into a relationship, I really lean on seeming coy and inexperienced to get my man excited in the sack. Little do they know I've slept with maybe 70-80 guys and am a raging sexaholic."
I write an agony aunt's column and at this stage I'm just making them up to fit with funny stock photos. I still get real submissions that are sad but also very boring.
This guy ghosted me and now I don't really feel that guilty that I gave him syphilis
"After finishing a bottle of red, I secretly move onto port. It looks the same in the glass, and the wife doesn't notice."
"On Christmas Day the dog jumped up and stole the ham from the worktop, I found him eating it on the kitchen floor. There was still about half left and I just served it up to everyone without mentioning it."

"If at the end of a TV show, the continuity announcer says Stay with us, I make a habit of flipping the channel and yelling No!. I have free will, dammit."
"My wife's got new glasses, she loves them but they make her look like Deirdre Barlow. I pretend to like them but one day it'll slip out."
"Until very recently I thought that if I kept my mouth closed whilst burping, the sound would be absorbed and nobody would hear. I'd been working in a fairly serious job for about 10 years, thinking I was getting away with it, before someone called me out for burping. Mortified."
Got pissed and thought it would be hilarious to shave my eyebrows off. Woke up and couldn't believe what I'd done. To make things worse my phones Face ID stopped working so I'm reminded of my stupidity multiple times a day.
"I am not a HGV driver - nor do I have a HGV licence - but, I occasionally google a 'journey', drive to a local depot, make a cargo scenario, and follow the cross country route of what a HGV driver would and then return home...in my mini."
"I blame working from home for my lack of sex drive to the wife, and it affecting my mental health; but the reality of it is, I masturbate a minimum of 3 times a day and I can't muster up a hard on until the weekend when she is at home all day"
I was once caught short so had a shit in a Kwiksave bag I'd found. I threw it over a hedge but it landed on the roof of a hearse leading a funeral cortege. The shame haunts me
I recently built a new top of the range gaming pc with parts that are sold out everywhere - 3080 FE & 5800X for those that are curious. I've spent almost all my time with it playing 2D factory building games - the fans don't even ramp up.
Any excess dust from the flavouring sachet of a packet of instant noodles gets rubbed into my gums like I'm a Wall Street stockbroker from the 80s on a night out.
"I mentioned a fact about a country on the news and my gf asked how I knew that, I said I'd seen a documentary about it. Really when I didn't have a job I used to get high and watch Go Jetters on CBBC. The theme tune is a banger and I learned about other countries"
"Sometimes when I'm on work calls, I just hold one headphone over 1 ear, because I like looking to see what I would like if I was a DJ. I don't even have any decks."
When they announce death numbers I always calculate that 2% are bound to be covid deniers and take solace in their ultimate surprise.
"I submit photos of non vegan meals to vegan social media pages, pretending they are made with vegan substitutes. They always get extremely high numbers of likes. I don't know why I do this."
"When my kids are asleep I pick bogeys out of their noses with a pair of tweezers, like a real life version of 'Operation'."
"Since the pandemic started and I'm working from home, I'm getting excited about the most mundane things. I've just ordered a riser for my monitor and now can't wait for it to arrive. Last week I assembled a desk, and it was better than sex."
"17 years old, I once used Head & Shoulders as a moisturiser for wanking. 3 days later hooked up with a girl and was going to lose my virginity until she saw my dick, skin flaking off it, agony as she tried to get me hard. Now I know what an astringent is."
I have been making sourdough bread during lockdown. I cheated making the starter though - I added a spoonful of bread yeast to the starter mixture. Worked a treat.

The wife once made a casserole that looked like absolute shit so I 'accidentally' dropped the whole thing on the floor and made it up by buying the whole family pizza.
"If I ever bend down to pick up something I've dropped in the kitchen I always imagine there's a sniper about a kilometer away who says Damn, target lost, into his radio."
I work with a bloke called Nicholas. When I say his name I pronounce it knickerless. He has no idea.
"My daughters boyfriend of 3 months left her because of her constantly making TikTok videos. Part of me thinks if he really liked her he'd see past that, but a larger part of me is jealous he's escaped the annoying TikTok videos that I have to put up with everyday."
I'm a dentist and I watch at least 20 people get on my dental chair every day. Most people do it in such a stupid fashion that I have no doubt the majority of the population are incredibly thick. You wouldn't believe how some people attempt it.
"I recently took delivery of one of the sex toys Lily Allen has been promoting, chosen on the basis of aesthetics only. Turns out it's brilliant, I'm up to using three times a day, and it's definitely her best work to date, although I did quite like her first album."
I have just eaten a 24 multi pack bag of Wotsits.
My girlfriend sounds like Michael Jackson when she orgasms and I'm scared to tell her.
I have never heard my wife fart. We were courting - that was a thing once upon time - for seven years and we've been married 26 years. She's either an angel or the hindenburg and about to blow.
"Every time I take my wask off l imagine I'm Donald Trump on the white house balcony. I don't know why, I despise him."
"At a previous job, somebody would eat my snacks left in the staff kitchen."
One day I coated the underside of a large chocolate chip cookie in black pepper and left it as a trap.
"The culprit was soonidentified, as a 60 odd year old woman dropped to the floor, gasping for air"
"We're in lockdown and the barbers are shut again, so my husband asked me to cut his hair with the clippers. He's really pleased with the result, but thats because he can't see the back of his head. He's got a baldy patch that he didn't have before."
I write mucky stories and post them on Literotica. They're all highly rated. It's the proudest thing I've ever done that no one knows about. If you've gone hand-to-gland reading one of my stories: you're welcome.
"Amateur porn has helped me understand my own body a lot more. Uneven tits and flaps and fine and stretchmarks, skintags and moles are all perfectly normal things. Thank you, pornography."
"Years ago there was a murder in the town, it ended up on Crimewatch. Me and 4 of my mates called up and said it was our class bully. He was taken from his house and all his clothes were ceased. He changed schools soon after but to this day most people in the town think it was him"
"When I talk to the cat, I give him the voice of a sulky teenager for when he replies."
"I'm a 23 year old woman. I've chatted up and shagged more women from Instagram than I ever have on dating apps. Straight, 40-something gym types are the best."

My wife pretends to be TV celebrities when we shag. The other day she revealed she actually practises the voices. My favourite is Zippy from Rainbow - it's intensely erotic.
"Me and my mates were teenage shits. We'd call random numbers from the phonebook, put on an accent - and tell women that we were cheating on their husbands. Most laughed it off. Until someone turned around once, cried saying their husband was dead. We stopped that trick."
I used to write film reviews for a magazine and was paid pretty well for it. I never saw the films and just made the reviews up based on the synopsis. My boss was amazed that I had access to films so early.
Sometimes my poo is so substantial it leaves me with a sense of euphoria for hours after the event and I want to let others know but never do. Fesshole feels a very appropriate name.
My flat is next to two speed cameras. I can spend up to half an hour at a time just watching and trying to predict who is going to get a ticket. I love the pointless flash of the brakelights just after the flash of the camera.
When I was 18 I worked in a newsagent. A customer lost a £20 pound note in the shop and went to the cash point. Whilst he was gone I found the £20 he dropped and spent it on scratch cards. I won £100. No regrets.
In 2008 I was made redundant but was too ashamed to tell my partner so instead I got dressed every morning into my office outfit and drove off. I spent every day at the seaside sitting in my car crying. Kept this up for 3 months until I got a new job.
"I am calling the new COVID variant, the Boris Variant, as I know how he likes to have things named after him: bikes, buses and bridges etc."
I can't be bothered waiting for the green man when I cross the road with my young daughters. When there's a big enough gap I just go for it.
Laying on my back having a wank. Got caught up in the moment and came over my face. I thought that was the worst of it until I woke up the next day with a crusty ear. Going back to socks from now on.
"I work for Shell doing technical work supporting oil & gas exploration. Like most people with a science background I know that catastrophic climate change is all but inevitable, and I'm part of the system that's causing it. I feel bad but they pay me too well to quit."
"Haven't had much 'me' time in lockdown so I've perfect a 6-minute wank, the exact time it takes for my partner to pop to the postbox and back. I've been sending a lot of birthday cards."
"I cook for my husband every night. I'm a good cook, but extremely clumsy. About once a week he eats stuff that's been on the kitchen floor and he doesn't know, but I figure, so far so good."
I'm the manager of a team of 18 people.
I hate every single one of them.
In the bedroom of the house where I grew up there's a surprise for whoever removes the wallpaper in the form of all the lyrics to the Sex Pistols Friggin' in the Riggin' written on the plasterboard. There's also a giant cock and balls. I do have standards.
Whilst pooing I sometimes worry that I've completely lost my mind and in reality I'm crouched pooing in the office in front of my coworkers.
"When I was 13 I had an argument with my mum in Primark because she tried to buy me size S underwear. I insisted she buy size L because I was convinced that it correlated with dick size, and I didn't want the cashier to think I had a small penis."

During lockdown I often walk the deserted streets at night pretending I'm in a post apocalyptic dystopia. I get annoyed if anyone else is around to spoil it for me. I'm 42.
My uncle is a conspiracy theorist. He thinks Covid isn't real and has been showing my 90 year old Grandma videos of David Fucking Icke. She doesn't want the vaccine because of the poisonous bullshit he's fed her. I hope he gets Covid and dies a horrible death ALONE. NO FUNERAL!
"I often fantasise that I'm showbiz pals with Caitlin Moran and Kathy Burke, and the tabloids - who have dubbed us the Gag Hags - haunt us as we take London's club scene by storm, being all fabulous and talking about fannies and whatnot."
"We go out and have a McDonald's breakfast most weekends when our daughter can't be arsed to get up before 11am. We come back home and then not have any lunch, forcing her to make her own. Snooze - you lose."
"I always believed that fat blokes not being able to see their penis when they looked down was a myth. After working from home, lockdown and excessive eating I can now sadly confirm this is true."
"I am a fairly successful ex footballer who is constantly asked to do TV/radio punditry. However I always turn it down as the truth is, I can't stand football. I only did it as a career as the money I earned allows me to do whatever I want for the rest of my life."
"I once ended up in bed with a naked girl, spent the entire night wondering if she was interested and I should make a move."
"My children ask me to sell their stuff on Facebook marketplace to make money for them to piss away on gaming. I always lie about what the items sell for, keeping about 20%, better spent on me than on a new gun for a made up character in a made up world on a made up game."
"I like my friends' tweets because I don't want them to feel bad about having so few likes, not because their tweets are any good"
"We think my Dad may have dementia but it's unclear because he's drinking heavily & depressed. I work in mental health so feel like I should have all the answers but in truth I feel completely helpless, desperately scared and so alone with the worry of what could happen to him."
"I enjoy following my old university's alumni group on Facebook, but only so that I can see how badly some of my peers have aged. Particularly those who were considered great beauties as students but to whom time has not been kind. I'm doing okay by comparison!"
"Everyone thinks I'm an intelligent person. And yet I usually don't understand movies. I enjoy them if they're visually stimulating, I just rarely understand what's going on unless I watch them several times."
"For a very long time I thought the lyrics to White Riot by The Clash were 'White rat, I wanna rat, white rat, a rat of my own'. Nobody corrected me when I sang along."

"Being middle aged, there's occasionally a sensation of a little more pee desperate to leave the tank, but can't. I find a quick tickle of my hairy arse cheeks is 100% effective in the instigation. Young folk may mock, but one day you'll be wistfully tickling your own arse."
"Whenever I have a really good bottle of wine open I also have a cheaper wine on the go, as my husband has no fucking taste and can't tell them apart, so i'm not wasting it"
My husband and I had a threesome with a dolphin trainer. After we all finished he gave us free tickets to the park he worked at. Really was a win win situation. 10/10 recommend.
"Three years ago, I was driving my car headfirst into a lorry to kill myself, about 10 seconds before I did it a text came though off a friend saying 'oi you fat fuck, fancy a bev?' I then realised I wasn't totally alone and honestly that text saved my life."

Before I knew the name of the song I used to think the chorus of Eton Rifles by The Jam was actually Eat a Trifle.
I bite my nails and spit them out over the living room floor. My girlfriend thinks it's the kids. It's me Sarah and I enjoy the kids blaming each other for their 'vile habit'
I pretend to be concerned about climate change but I never use the eco setting on my dishwasher.
Whenever my boyfriend comes round I steal all the change he puts next to his wallet. If he's being an asshole that day I'll take the 20s out his wallet too.
"Whenever one of my children piss me off by not doing as they're fucking told or moaning about something totally fucking pointless, I eat one of their treats from the treat cupboard in front of them. It's directly responsible for my weight gain but it really gets to them so I win."
"I had a drunken shag in a graveyard, against a headstone, with a random girl from the pub. Partway through, a stray dog wandered up and started sniffing my arsehole. I was about to swat it away when I realised it actually felt quite good, so I let the dog carry on."
"I've already sorted out five Christmas presents for friends next year. Three shit books, a hideous jumper, and a gift set of bath stuff. They are all gifts that were given to me this year. I've been doing this for nearly 20 years. No one has sussed yet."
"My wife and I drop our vitamin D supplements together, pretending they are E's. Neither of us have ever taken actual ecstasy before. I am 43."
"I filmed my wife and I having sex, something to save away in the wank bank. Unfortunately, while she's georgous, the fat lug ineffectively humping away at her is just gross. I don't know what she sees in me."
"When in Phuket, Thailand with my fiance on the last night of our South East Asia tour I orchestrated a drunken argument so I could go and have sex with a hooker. It worked. Turned out the women hooker was a man and I did it anyway. We split up 2 years later."
As a single bloke who lives alone the highlight of my week in lockdown is getting a few cans from the off license and sitting in the park drinking. It's like being 16 again only with added loneliness
"I always fake a limp across a pedestrian crossing, hoping the people in stopped vehicles feel sorry for me."
"My boss is an avid chess player whilst I am novice. I've been playing him online for months using a separate chess computer and have been kicking his arse, much to his delicious frustration"
"I never shower more than twice a week. My wife, who would not hesitate to mention it if I stank, has never twigged. Unless you get really sweaty or mucky, there's no reason to shower more often. It's far better for your skin. Saves money on shampoo, soap, power and water too."
"I live on a large estate and every now and then I put my wheelie bin out early just to watch all the other houses put theirs out, sometimes the whole estate does it. It's like a domino effect."
At an early 90's scout camp I tripped over the guide rope from the toilet tent and ripped the door clean off. Camp was cancelled that weekend and everyone went home. Never did tell anyone that was me
I've got absolutely no idea what to do with my arms when I go to sleep.

"After I've flushed away a number 2 I have a little internal celebration as I wash my hands, relieved that I've managed once more to avoid dying on the toilet. Every time."
"I've been mail ordering Donald Trump toilet roll and sending it to the White House FAO Mr Trump, weekly for the last year. Now that he's left I'm not sure what to do to keep me mildly entertained."
When working in a CD factory in the mid 90s I signed a load of Wonderwall inlays 
have a supersonic Xmas - love Noel
My husband decided he wanted us to have an open marriage. I agreed as no longer satisfied in bedroom. I began going on 'dates' - fuck dates. He still thinks I was only meeting them for drinks! He has had no dates of any kind!
"When people ask me for directions I always tell them carry on straight ahead as far as you can, then turn left. Always! Sorry. Not Sorry."
I drunkenly binned a take away pizza in its box in our recycle bin. This morning. Hungover. Bin pizza was the tastiest breakfast
"I'm single, and use online word games like scrabble to evaluate women I meet on dating apps. If I can get high AF and still kick their ass, it probably isn't going to work."
"Kid on the street spun me a yarn about leaving his wallet on the train. Ended up giving him £100, he gave me his number to arrange for his mum to pay me back. Didn't reply to my 'are you ok' text & I realised his story didn't stack up. Feel a right nob now."
I didn't order minute steak for years and often wondered which dickheads were ordering a tiny steak anyway
"My wife and I have a thing where if either of us spots the other one wearing underwear with holes in, said underwear may be summarily ripped to shreds while the owner is still wearing them. Not sure where it started but it keeps you on your toes."
"At the start of an affair with someone I was convinced was the love of my life I started writing a novel for them. When it was finished, we split up. I can't help feeling the two things are connected. I wish I'd made the novel considerably longer."
"My pin number is 4732 and I have around £4,500 in my current account at the time of writing"
"I've got 3 kids. The eldest two are almost adults now, yet they can't be trusted to do even the most basic facets of life properly. Closing doors. Turning off lights. Even flushing the toilet seems to be consistently beyond them. Does my head in"
"My son's friends arranged a house party for New Year's Eve. I grassed them up to the police, who closed the party down and fined them. Not sorry - little shits."
Before a big poo I'll build my self up by imagining Greg Wallace is doing an introduction like on the opening titles on masterchef. Pooing doesn't get tougher than this
"I am so glad that COVID has stopped parent evenings at school. Not a guilty confession, just saying what I cant say at home."
When opening Netflix via my voice activated remote control I have to say 'Netflix-aaaah' in a Mark E Smith style. I did it once and now it no longer recognises my normal voice.

"I am a heterosexual male. In 1999 I went out with a girl who looked a bit like Francesco Totti, especially when her mouth was closed. Always had a bit of a thing for Tottigol ever since."
"I'm 45 year old dad of two and I don't actually know what shoe size I am. What's more worrying, I don't really know what I'm supposed to be feeling for when I'm in a shoe shop and pushing the front of the shoe down next to my kids toes. I just do it."
"I lead a marketing campaign for a luxury clothing brand, I can tell you now... if you see someone wearing Supreme, Gucci, LV etc they aren't actually that wealthy we target the wannabe rich, actual wealthy people wouldn't be seen dead in our clothing we all know it as well"
"I've been with my wife over 20 years. Yesterday for the first time she sent me a pic of her tits. You would not believe how much time I've spent looking at it. Not as good as seeing them in person, obvs, but it makes me so happy to be able to have a little peek whenever I want."
"The only thing I want to know, in the whole world, is whether or not my beautiful colleague really was deliberately touching my foot with their's, on multiple occasions, under the tearoom table. The idea that something could have happened consumes me to this day."
Back in the day I used to graffiti around my town. Now I write my 'tag' in the condensation on the back of the shower door
Wife thinks I drink too much beer. As a treat though she bought me a random case of craft beers for xmas. I have been adding random shop bought cans to this box from my secret stash in the garage. So far I have had 37 beers from the original 12. She hasnt noticed yet.
"Whenever I peel a hard boiled egg, I always enjoy squeezing it and imagining it's a small, firm boob"
"Since lockdown, I've stopped wiping my arse. I like to compare skid marks with those of my children's - 4 and 6 - at the end of the day. Cleanest gusset wins."
"When using the toilet brush, to stop it dripping when putting it back, I hit it side to side in the bowl quickly and pretend I'm Bob Ross cleaning his brushes."
"When the pandemic started, I was convinced the white side of the mask faced out and convinced my family. Then one day sat outside a coffee shop I realised I was wrong as everyone else had the blue outside. I changed mine and then convinced my family I'd always had it like that."
"My job is to stop terrorists. But when the weather is icy, I pretend my icy breath is steam coming from a train as I make choo choo noises."
My Twitter and Facebook profile pictures are topless photos of me but with my tits cropped out
"Our kids are hypnotised by Minecraft in lockdown. We ban it for a day once a week ish, and the day we give it back, our sex sessions are gratifyingly elaborate. #ish"
Whenever I get shade thrown at me on Twitter I look at the Tweets & Replies of @Ocado to remind myself that it could be so much worse
"When I'm putting the washing out, I always leave the 'big guys' jumpers, towels and jeans etc, aside whilst attending to the smalls and more petit garments. I tell the big guys to stay patient, you'll be given a luxury hanger after I've finished with the pants."
"Wife enabled Google photo sharing on her phone a few years ago to send me a lot of photos at once, forgot to turn it off. I can see any photo she takes and I check occasionally for nudes. Instead, just a lot of mundane pictures that she is sending to her mum."
Add your confession to the form: Maybe you did something weird with a carpet?
"Whilst I love my wife unconditionally, I'm not convinced that our decision not to have children is the right one. I've had to mute most of my friends on social media as they are always banging on about their kids which in turn makes me question our choices even more"
I've been in a gang all my life. Never been caught. Last year I decided I wanted to live a clean life and started working as a salesman for a big company. I hate all my colleagues. They're all whiny. Never wanted to rob people as much as I do now.
"In 1999 a furious Cockney pensioner phoned our Sky call centre about a no-show engineer. He kept shouting, 'I'M SITTIN HERE LIKE A PRIZE CUNT, I AM'. The tech lads ran me a copy and it's been on all my phones for 20 years. Thanks for the laughs, prize cunt!"
My birthday is on the 25th January so I always buy a second advent calendar that I start on New Year's Day.
"When I put clean cutlery from the dishwasher into the drawer it has to go in the specific order knives-forks-spoons-teaspoons. If I put, say, a spoon in before a fork I lose points. All this is accompanied by an internal sport-style commentary.My pet name for my wife is dippy egg but when she annoys me I change it to dickhead and say it quickly. She's so used to the former she doesn't notice but I feel a sense of jubilation every time I get away with it."
I reversed into a car in a car park. No one saw. But did the right thing and left a note. £900 for a new bumper! Paid it to the garage. Not even a word of thanks from the owner for being honest. First and last time.
"I've taken to shaving my pubic hair off, not for aesthetic reasons, but because I like the noise that patting the smooth area makes."
I once got a condom stuck inside me without realising. It fell out in the toilets at work 4 days later. I had sex with someone else in between those two events. It was a wake up call.
Whenever I spot one of my own confessions on @fesshole I always make sure I reply with a this never happened or something gammony just to annoy the anonymous version of me that wrote the confession.
"When I was at senior school I would buy a plastic cup of soup from the canteen, take it to an empty classroom and balance it on top of the door. The first person to open the door - usually a teacher - got covered in soup. Not sorry. Still managed to get 11 O Levels."
"Potty training my toddler is so stressful that I've taken to raiding her Christmas selection box every time she has a screaming fit in order to get something out of the experience. She's down a Double Decker, some Mini Buttons and a Freddo so far."
"I've recently started smoking weed again at the ripe old age of 40. It's miles better than drinking, everyone should do it."
"My ex was still using my netflix as I'm far too nice. As soon as I became sick of it, I waited until there was one episode of Mad Men left and changed the password."
Every time I wank I take off my wedding ring first. Just seems more respectful that way.
I do all the laundry in our house. 
My wife sometimes wears clothes that I think are awful. I always leave these at the bottom of the wash bin so she can't wear them very often. 
Sometimes the odd really bad thing gets damaged by the washing machine & can't be worn again...
Whenever I put my bra on I need to arrange my nipples so they point straight ahead. I call this manoeuvre repointing.

Whenever I sit on the toilet I look between my legs and lower my testis into the pan and pretend I'm a Boeing 737 making a landing.
I don't masturbate and never have really because I think my dead relatives see me and it feels silly.
Was getting fat scoffing salt and vinegar crisps. Now instead I down a shot of vinegar with a sprinkling of sea salt several times a day. Intense but delicious
When I was a student we used to ring up a pirate radio station and get them to give an open invite to a house party at the house next door.
"I have quite an expensive divers watch. Never been deeper than the big end at my local pool, but excellent for timing when I've dropped a E and waiting for it to come up. So simple to use."
"In the mid 80's, 4 of us driving down London Rd in Brighton one evening, stopped near a young man outside the Co-op. We beckoned him over and as he approached we threw a bag of flour at him. No only was he covered, the cloud stopped traffic. "
"If that was you, I really am sorry."
"Early 90s - My dad forced me to do a paper round when I was 14. The local paper had a competition to win £500 using a scratchcard given away in each copy. I kept all the scratchcards, won £500 & quit. Really pissed my dad off. Bought a gameboy & 10 games."
"My brother is ex-police, he retired and kept his dog, a snifferdog for drugs. Whenever I dog-sit, I sit and smoke joint after joint with the dog going apeshit next to me."
My dog is gross. He literally ate the entire crotch out of my super-expensive and super-tight Spanx. The bonus is that they still hold everything in while sparing me the agony of taking them down to go for a pee. Thanks Snoopy.
"15 years ago I held my best mate and crushes' handbag and shielded her whilst she got fucked behind some speakers in a terrible club by some random lad. Worst part is, I still get off thinking about the brief glance of boob and arse I saw."
"During rag week a water fight culminated with me accidentally blasting an elderly lady full in the face with a water-bomb, she was clearly fresh from the hairdressers. 25+ years later and I still feel rotten"
Worked in a well known British supermarket chain years ago. 
The bakery always changed the date on the fresh bread stickers. You're always eating older bread than you think. Sorry.
"When I'm finishing muesli I pretend to be a cowboy gold prospector, and swill the last of the milk round to catch the valuable bits."
A few years ago our department did the draw of a staff Christmas raffle that stood to win you a half decent hamper. We drew the company owner first and then the second in command. Only on the third delve into the hat did we find someone worthy and that we didn't hate.
Just had a cheeky sleepy shag with the missus; afterwards opened my eyes to find the dog in the bed making full eye contact.
"30 yrs ago I got a job as an intern at a law firm in the US. Another intern I couldn't stand because he kept trying to impersonate my accent, I changed his 'resume' on the company word processor to read he was a member of NAMBLA, 'National American Man Boy Love Association'."
Being Irish has so many advantages when traveling abroad; mainly not being taken for English. Advised an English buddy to say he was Irish in Spain. He told me people loved him. Advised an Irish buddy - who's a bit of a twat - to say he was English when he travelled.

"I once met a stunning guy in a bar who I desperately tried to chat up. He wasn't interested in me, and I was gutted. I thought about him a lot afterwards but never saw him again until he appeared on the news, having murdered and partially eaten his partner. I still would have."
For Christmas dinner last year my other half and I cooked chicken instead of turkey for our mums and didn't tell them. Neither of them noticed.

Made a prank call saying there was a bomb at my school at the height of when the IRA were bombing mainland UK hoping to get the next day off. I'd forgotten that it was the schools Open Evening. Sorry to all those made to stand in the cold while the dogs checked for bombs.
"I've only used five rolls of toilet paper since March 2020. Have a poo before your shower, and clean up under hot soapy water. Much more hygienic."
"Known my longest-standing friend for 41 years. I was even best man at his first wedding. He's so bloody annoying lately, I've muted the cunt on every bit of social media we share."
"I once tied my neighbours windscreen wipers to his garage door so that when he drove off, they ripped away. I was 7 and wanted to be part of the local gang"

"I felt guilty for not phoning my dad on Christmas day but his Brexit praising, racism tinged monologue on boxing day made me wish I'd never called him at all."
"I was secretly pleased enemy COVID meant no school nativity this year. Having 3 kids I've been subjected to these for a decade now and I dread them. Tuneless singing, forgotten lines, unconvincing costumes, poor production. I hope they never return."
"I lost my girlfriend aged 30 to covid and pneumonia this year, Sometimes you don't realise how lucky you are in life until its too late. I wish I told her I loved more often."
Whenever an idiot posts on Facebook something along the lines of what time does the post office open/what's the number of the Chinese restaurant/how much is the bus to town etc I reply with wrong information and generally total bollocks.
As a child I was playing in a family friends garden with their two collie dogs. My knee accidentally collided with a dogs head with a sickening crack. Dog seemed OK so I didn't say anything. Mum told me a few days later that one of the dogs had died from a brain haemorrhage.
I've started slipping a couple of glugs of whisky into my coffee every day. It's the only way I can cope these days.
I have a cock-washing dilemma. As a professional horologist I often use a dab of cock cheese to lubricate the very tiny components. Were I to be more thorough with my 'gentleman's wash' I would have to put my prices up. It's simple supply and demand really.
"Turned down the opportunity to start an affair this year as I love my wife. Spent a lot of time and effort arranging several really thoughtful gifts for Christmas, which she loved. She got me a Chocolate Orange. Wish I'd had the affair."
"My school bully died in a house fire decades after we left school. Every year on the anniversary of my tormentor's demise, I go to the graveyard early before anyone else is there to dance & celebrate on his grave."
"I regularly order takeaways through Uber Eats, and if the driver's car is newer than mine, then they don't get a tip."
I know a mid level coke dealer. My mates get me to buy 'good shit'. Naturally by cutting theirs mine is free. I've become increasingly cynical/adventurous with what I use. Lately it's been my exfoliated dry heel skin. I have a foot 'grater' that catches the powdered skin. Sorted
I have no interest in my wife's boobs since she had them done. Small tits porn is my go to now
Whoever said dogs are good for you're mental health was talking complete bollocks. Mine is a total whiney cunt.
I work in a posh leisure club. I've had sex with a lot of patrons around the pool and sauna areas. Once I pulled out and came into the path of a fan which blew it into the air conditioning duct. Someone at the restaurant complained someone else had spat on them. I guess it was me
I bought my girlfriend a dildo for Christmas. She opened it in front of her mum. It had a spinning head with multiple attachments and a thing to tickle her bum.
I make a big thing about liking craft beers and obscure brews from around the world. But when I am alone and want a quick pint I will always have a Tuborg from the local 'Spoons.
"It's was a great 2020 for me as an articulated lorry driver. Constant employment, quiet motorways and I've even worked some Saturdays on overtime. Earned more than 2019. Here's to 2021!"

I often deliver parcels to Kilroy. Former tv presenter and professional racist. I make sure to stop and have a wee on his driveway each time I visit.
I'm a tiler and plasterer. I use my grout float as a sex toy. The Mrs has no idea. I'm just glad to get it off my chest
Every morning I wake up and wish I didn't. Lucky bastards die in their sleep
I miss the first lockdown. These new tiers are crap. Bring back total lockdown. It was bliss. Quiet walks. No traffic. Clean air. No soap operas on TV. The whole world was letting the planet breathe. Why are we so eager to get back to the excruciating old days?
"Used to work in a mens' shoe store. Always put the largest sizes on the lowest shelf, and the small sizes on the highest. Well, it amused me."
"I've been a catholic priest for the best part of 30 years, for at least the last 15 years I have had no faith that there is even a god. Most of the time I can't stand the words that come out of my mouth during mass, but I don't know what else I could do."
"My most James-Bond-y moment so far was when I drunkenly shagged a stranger and then jumped out his flat window, landed in a forward roll, and sprinted off. Shag was terrible but MAN that part felt cool"
The vast majority of people in the corporate world are shockingly bad at it.. its just amusing watching the blowhards trampling over each other. I've been coasting at 40% for years and it's never held me back. Politeness and not fucking people over gets you surprisingly far
I jacked off to Leisure Suit Larry 1 on the Commodore Amiga when I was a teenager.
"I bought a VR headset for Xmas for me and my kids to have fun on, I've just discovered VR porn and it's nothing short of life changing"
"I always have a VPN turned on and set to a different country so the ads on YouTube are for products I cant even buy and are often in a different language, I feel a good sense of achievement that I'm doing my small part to bring down massive corporations."
"Am listening to husband laugh while playing GearsofWar with his mates. Perhaps - more than the misery & non-interaction I get - this makes me want out. A braying laugh, the opposite of infectious. I want to be happy for him that he is enjoying himself. It just makes me feel dead"
"My boyfriend has started giving everything 'code names' he's 24, for example when we go shopping it's 'operation screaming eagle is go' And he does it for absolutely everything, making us a brew 'operation drinkypoo' having a shower 'operation waterfall' ITS DRIVING ME MAD"
I goaded a feral 6 Yr old in my class to swing a punch at me just so I could have her excluded. It worked but as I blocked the punch she roundhouse kicked me in the vagina. Still worth the two days without her disruption.
"I deliver groceries. If you're polite & friendly, I'll often credit something back just because I like you. If you're a dickhead, I won't even credit back the stuff you return."
When I'm walking the dog I award marks to the numbers on houses. 5/5 is only for French style white on blue. I am baffled by how many people seem to favour aesthetics over legibility
"I run a really popular parody Twitter account of a well known political figure. Tens of thousands of followers, every post goes semi viral. My personal account is followed by Russian porn bots and the odd mentalist. I don't know why no one likes the real me"

I'm employed as a statistical consultant for a civil service department. I only have a basic knowledge of stats and simply google all questions I'm asked. Really tough ones I say I'm working on it and post to a student stats forum for help.
"I recently got the calculator out and done a bit of thinking. 365 x 27 = reckon pretty soon I'll have my 10,000th wank🍾"
When I was about 8 I randomly threw a stone over the wall of my front garden into the street. A few minutes later I heard some shouting and looked out to see an angry neighbour of ours complaining about his car's broken window. I never said anything.
"Backpacking in Thailand in 2008 and in an Internet cafe, some Scottish fella had left himself logged on to FB. My friends and I posted a load of extremely racist and ladyboy sex related statuses on his profile. I sometimes wonder if we ruined his life. Sorry if we did pal."
"I feign interest in people's pets on Twitter, just to get the name of said pet so I can add it to my muted words list. I have no interest in seeing pictures of cats or dogs on my feed."
I desperately needed to piss while in a cubicle with my two year old son after a swimming lesson. 
"Unable to leave him and all our belongings I pissed into a Lidl 4+ nappy, which I'm happy to report can absorb the full bladder of an adult male."
"Last year at work, while microwaving lunch one of my co-workers walked into the kitchen and complemented me on how good the food smelled. But really I'd had Mexican food the night before and had just farted"
"My upstairs neighbours have raucous parties late on Saturday night, keeping me awake. So at 7am on Sunday morning I play the THX deep note through an 800 watt amp and subwoofer to wake them up, followed by some drum and bass. Nothing like window shaking passive aggressiveness."
"I do a scarily realistic impression of a crying baby. Do it at random times in the house. Neighbours ask how the baby is, didn't know we were expecting/having etc. I pull a concerned face and explain to them there is no baby, but the people living here before us had one that died"
I recently bought some paracetamol in a rush and only realised when I got home that they were suppositories. I used them nevertheless and found the taking of them more pleasurable than oral tablets so will use suppositories from now on.
"Was a skint 19 year old student nurse, and a patient I was looking after died and there was £10 in his locker, so nicked it."
Think he would have been cool with it.
"When I was 6, decided to see how hot my mums coffee was, by stirring it with a thermometer. The glass broke and all the Mercury went into her coffee, plus the glass. Panicked and ran to my room. Not sure she noticed. Was convinced she would die. I'm now 45 and my Mum is fine."
"Once ordered a ludicrous number of condoms, a massive dildo, lubes and furry handcuffs. It was a discrete recorded delivery, but was just left on my doorstep. Pretended it never arrived and got another set for free. This happened twice before they realised. So many dildos..."
I work in IT. Since March I haven't worked a single day. I wiggle my mouse every 20 minutes and randomly close off a couple of tickets every week or so. In my end of year review my boss gave me Outstanding so I will be getting a hefty pay rise in the new year. No regrets.
"My Mum always finds it hilarious when Dad informs us all about his morning dump. 'Like an otter off a riverbank - not even a ripple' usually raises the biggest chortle from Mum. It's quite sweet I suppose, in a totally fucked up kind of way. Love is weird."
"Dickhead at school used to go around punching people in the arms, he did it to me once and I cried, as I'd just had a jab, was off school for 3 days and came back with my upper arm wrapped in bandages saying it had swollen up. He was suspended. "
The jab was in the other arm.
Sometimes I drive around town with no other purpose than to just to spin Pokestops. I'm also a paid up member of the Green party.

When my boyfriend pisses me off I wash his clothes in a hot wash to shrink them. This depresses him as he thinks he's put weight on.
My boyfriend tends to drip piss to the side of the toilet. I have started using his face towel to clean it off.
I love a warm toilet seat. I'll often wait till someone has just left the toilet cubical at work and dive straight in to get the full benefit.
A few weeks ago I found myself sat next to Nigel Farage and yesterday I was sat next to Tommy Robinson. I now believe I must be an assassin sent from the future but have failed in my mission.
I've lived in London for 6 years and never paid a penny in rent. After 2 weeks on a mates sofa started job at estate agents and just stayed at furnished To Let properties ever since. Life in a holdall is great. Fuck you landlords!
"When I get a bad head cold, I pinch my nose closed and blow. This forces gunk out of my tear duct! Totally gross but I quite enjoy it. The weird things the human body can do!"
"Look, the reason your AirPods aren't working is because I accidentally put them through the wash in the pocket of your jeans."
"After leaving my first ever glowing kebab shop review I suffered the most unimaginable internal trauma, I now leave it at least 2 clear days before leaving my review"
I have 2 sons 6 and 3 and I get no better pleasure than picking the hard bogies from their noses.
"If I can tell the Mrs is in the mood and I'm not, I just say I'm off to the loo. Then I force out a long, loud shit or farts at least & walk back into the room apologising for the stench. All of a sudden she's tired. No idea why."
"I'm a professional man in my 30s, in my 20s I preferred coke to paying my bills. The negative effect on my credit rating is still hurting me. Monthly mortgage payments 2x my neighbour for same house. No one knows. Pay your bills on time, kids."
"It pisses me off that my wife calls Nice biscuits nice, when they're pronounced nice, it's not rocket science"
A few years ago my dog followed me into the corner shop. He peed all over the bread on the bottom shelf. I left quickly without telling anyone and have felt so guilty ever since.
"A Christmas card got wrongly delivered to my house, I opened it hoping there would be money in...there was a £20 note, kept it and binned the card, it's been a tough year, not sorry"
"I am a teacher. I do my best to support all my pupils, hard working or not, more or less able, and I am judged on my results. However, I love it when the kids who deserve it do badly in their exams."
"I got cancer a couple of years ago. A month of radiotherapy fixed it, and I've been clear since. I feel guilty because of all the people that die from cancer, but for me it was a minor inconvenience."
"We spent Xmas Eve last year with our Brexit supporting, Trump loving in laws. Their dog has a special diet. I fed him pate. They spent Xmas morning cleaning up liquid shit in the living room."

"Our 3 year old has picked up our foul language. When something goes wrong he shouts for fuck sake I have to act all shocked and outraged if other people are there, but if it's just us I high 5 him."
"I've slept with girls called Alison, Philippa and Annabel. I often wonder if I should try for the full 'A Song for Whoever' set."
"I'm 31f and I endlessly pick my nose and wipe it everywhere. Furniture, sofas, under tables and shelves, under my car seat. Thought I'd grow out of it but nope."
"I told work I was having relationship troubles and moved out of my home so wouldn't be coming to work as I was too distressed. In reality, I was at Centre Parc's."
"Bored home alone once, I built a cock shape out of the kids Lego, lubed my arse and stuck it up there but a bit broke off and got stuck. Due to embarrassment I left it there hoping it would come out at the next download. It took 4 days."
"When I pay at the pump, I always get a thrill that people haven't seen me put my card in think I've just driven off. Always at speed for effect"
Didn't see the zit on my neck and shaved off the top of it. It would've made a satisfying pop. In a year of so few genuine pleasures I felt pretty ripped off.
"I've been single for over a year. A work colleague brings it up all the time, with some smart arse comment about how I should go about finding someone who will put up with me Little does he know but his wife of 12 yrs has been sexting me throughout lockdown. Jokes on you Gary"
The biggest impact of COVID lockdowns for me is that I have totally given up on ironing and now smoke weed every day. Pre-lockdown: sober ironing machine. During lockdown: creased tshirts and a drug addiction
God my kids are a pair of cunts at the moment
"I'm a woman and only like quickies. I'm turned on and cum fast, and won't sleep with men my age anymore - 40s- because they take so bloody long."
"Spending more time online during lockdown, I've drifted into becoming a furry. My former guest bedroom now contains racks of fake fur, a half-finished fursuit, and no bed. I don't know what I'm going to tell family and friends when they want to stay over again after the pandemic."
My neighbors have a dog that they don't want so keep fobbing it off on me to look after whilst they go away for weekends. This has gone on for years. Last time I looked after it I fed the thing a big plate of sprouts and gravy. They haven't asked me to look after it since
When I was an adolescent I used to jack off and spill my load over the side of the bed next to the wall for about two years. To this day my family rib me for that time I can home and threw up over the side of my bed. I don't correct them.
"Before lockdown I was walking from one side of the building to the other. En route I noticed a man coming towards me in a Balor Club wrestling t-shirt. Without saying a word to each other we did the too sweet hand salute. It's nerdiest, coolest thing I've ever done."
I hide from my 2 and 4 year old kids in increasingly elaborate places during hide and seek so I can get some peace and quiet. Currently submitting this from underneath a duvet in the wardrobe in our spare bedroom. Been here almost 10 minutes.

For much of December I was holed up in the guest bedroom shouting Don't come in!!! every time someone passes the door. Everybody assumes I'm wrapping Christmas presents but in actual fact I was wanking.
"Sometimes I will deliberately do things around the house with one hand, just to see how I'd cope if I lost an arm"
I'm the MD of a small carpet company. Been embezzling off the owners for years. Hate the job but couldn't move on cos I would have been found out. Now the firm is going down the tubes and my criminality is going to get exposed. I'm totally fucked.
My wife thinks I've been picking up the dog's shit but I gave up ages ago. I just wait until she's not looking and run the lawnmower over it. It gets mushed up and watering the grass makes it pretty indistinguishable from mud. Occasionally have to say must have missed that one.
"When I lost my virginity the song Yellow by Coldplay was playing from somewhere. Now, even though I fucking hate Coldplay I get a lob on when it comes on the radio."
"First and only time I put air in my car tyres, I broke the valve. Been scared of doing it ever since and get my Dad or the garage to do them. I'm 34."
My wife thinks I'm a cautious driver as I always sit in the slow lane on the motorway. The fact is when I'm driving is the only time I get to listen to the music I like when she's around so I just drive slowly everywhere.
"My brother lives in same street as me. He was showing off how hi tech his Xmas lights are by being wired to his Alexa. When he goes out, I shout through his letter box to turn them on or off. He has sent 2 plugs back so far."
"Every time I meet a new friend, I think I am falling in love. Male or female, it doesn't matter. After a couple of years I realise that is just the sensation of getting a new friend. I think this is how I ended up married to the wrong person."
"When i was 8, i would talk my mate into stealing cash from his parents coin dump in their bedroom so we could spend it on penny sweets."
"In the 90's a 'mates' parents went on holiday. We made said, 'mate' have a party. We found his dad's wank mags. We/I proceeded to rip out images and put them behind the family pictures for them to find in the future."
"I don't wash my hands after I piss, I don't see the point. But my wife thinks it's gross so I just run the tap for a few seconds after I piss to fool her"
I once had a wank with a slice of ham like Jay from The Inbetweeners. Fucking stunk.
I hate some of my co-workers but cant do anything about their behaviour towards me so I try and be petty as possible by changing the colour settings on their monitors bit by bit so they don't notice fully.
Have called multiple women bruv during sex.
"I slept with a girl at uni once and after she asked for the full condom, she then put it in a cupboard with 5/6 other full condoms. I HAVE NEVER RAN AWAY SO FAST."
"Whenever I'm in a public toilet and there's someone in a cubicle, I get an almost uncontrollable urge to yell SHITTING MAN! in my best Brian Blessed voice."

I only started watching Strictly Come Dancing to see the hot female professionals flash their knickers. Now I'm really into the dancing and have promised the wife I'll take lessons with her.
"On holiday in the South of France I bought fresh rabbit for dinner knowing my children wouldn't eat it if they knew it was rabbit. So, I told them it was French Chicken. They ate it, and to this day they still think there is such a thing as French Chicken."
"I utterly despise our cat. It's needy, stupid, annoying and expensive. I have never hated an animal more and I long for it's passing"
I'm seriously pissed off that the most expensive and special present for my kid has been attributed to Santa. Santa hasn't spent the last 2 months in a covid swarmed work place saving and sacrificing to afford the fucking thing.
"I'm a straight man but when I see Freddie Mercury on Queen Live at Wembley, I get a semi-on. Don't know what it is about the man."
I was bullied a lot in high school. To get my own back I make accounts on PornHub that have the bully's name as usernames. I then comment on the kinkiest videos I can find. Been doing it a while now. Really brings me a sense of peace.
"I forgot to lock my house one night before going out, when I came back it had been burgled- I smashed the window and got the insurance payout, the police were too overworked to do any proper investigation"
"Just before Christmas, I poke holes in my husband's socks so when he gets new ones as a present he appreciates them."
"My old band played a gig as support to a proper band. Afterwards, a drunk fan asked me if I was in the main band. I lied and signed his precious copy of their biggest hit. So did my brother, our drummer. And our bass player. Sorry."
When I was a young teen I thought a Basque Terrorist was some weirdo dressing in sexy gear. It wasn't until a trip to Barcelona when I was 18 that I found out the truth.
Someone I follow on Twitter once posted a picture of their boarding pass as they went on holiday. It included their booking reference. So I visited the British Airways website and cancelled their return flight.
"My GF thinks I go for a run every day. I don't, I go to a local dogging spot and cruise for gay sex, getting sucked off by old men most days. On the other days I get a McDonalds and enjoy the tranquility eating a Big Mac in the car park."
I use my wife's silicon based anal lube to keep my elderly parents wooden drawers easy to open on their antique furniture
"Got a foot long from Subway on my dinner break. Ate it on the way back. Went for a shit. Also a foot long. One in, one out."
"Lived with an obnoxious flat mate who would loudly play Call of Duty until 4AM. Took great pleasure in sneaking out of bed, unplugging the router and listening to his screams"
"If being married has taught me anything, that for 30 years I was stacking the washing machine wrong, driving badly, ironing wrong, hoovering wrong, using the microwave wrong, mowing the lawn wrong, making coffee wrong, walking wrong, breathing too heavily, blowing my nose wrong.."
"Worked on public transport and brought home stuff left behind. No valuables, just things that would be binned - chargers, clothing, booze, flasks, books, porn, stationery, brollies, sex toys, maps, sweets, toiletries, food, soft drinks, wellies, sports accessories, snacks..."

"I have a pair of long-nosed electricians' pliers that sit on a hook in the shed. Every time I need them, I am compelled to use them to pull my ear hair out before starting the job. It nips a bit, but it's a very satisfying and effective method of hair removal."
I've used Wikipedia since it launched in 2001 yet never donated a penny. Even when they beg for £2 I scroll past for my free content.
"At a primary school nativity I had to play accompaniment to 'Little Donkey' on the glockenspiel. I couldn't read music so I just made it up, hitting different bars randomly each time. No one said anything but it must have been obvious and awful. It still haunts me 30 years later."
Whenever I cook super noodles for my kids I always eat half of the seasoning sachet before I make them. They never notice and I love that weird chickeny dust
"Since becoming single dad to twin girls I've done huge amounts of shoplifting. I go into a shop put things in the bag, the kids cause a scene, I leave flustered. I'm sure if it went to court I play the 'dead mother/useless daddy' honest mistake card and would get off"
When a recipe says to wilt spinach a handful at a time I just yeet the whole lot in at once and it always turns out fine
Had anal on the first date with a tinder match. As soon as I went in I knew something was wrong & pulled out covered in poo. Ran to the bathroom where I was sick everywhere. As I puked poo droped off me went everywhere. Afterward I cleaned myself up & quietly left. Sorry Elaine.
Whenever I get the house to my self and I feel like knocking one out to pornhub on my laptop I use the bluetac from one of my kids posters to cover the camera in case anyone is watching. The post wank guilt often kicks in when I'm replacing it back onto its spot.
My wife gives amazing head and can almost deep throat. I'm so competitive that whenever I eat a banana I see how much I can take. I can take more than her btw.
I hate my family with a passion. I'm actively trying to infect then all with Covid in the hopes it kills a few of them off.
I chose to piss myself when I was 12 because I didn't want to wake up the girl I had a massive crush on. I'd have to climb over her on the coach to go to loo but I didn't want to disturb her.
I'm 46yrs old and throughout lockdown all I've wanted to do is smoke some weed. It's been at least 15 years since I brought some and I've no idea where to get any from or what it costs any more...I did however spend £200 while drunk on a specialised vaper just in case I get any!
I work as a delivery driver for a major supermarket. Customers in the shop are so cunty that when I'm driving the van I deliberately scratch and bump the publics vehicles. The van isn't mine so I don't care.
Up until the age of 17 I thought reindeers were mythical creatures.
"Our new bathroom doesn't have a mirror fitted yet so I shave using a hand held one in shower- I like to pretend I'm in The Fugitive, hastily changing my appearance in a motel room to keep one step ahead of a tenacious Tommy Lee Jones."
I married my hot lover rather than my reliable fiancée. She was willing to forgive but I wasn't willing to lose face. So I pretended to everyone I fell hopelessly in love with the lover. Married her 14 months later. Regretted it since. Never told anyone the truth.
I'm a 26 year old female human and I really fancy Paddington Bear in the movies. His eyes are so dreamy.

At this time last year the pressures of work got to me and I was at the brink of commuting suicide. I'm watching It's A Wonderful Life right now and think I might have had my very own Clarence last year. Have a lovely Christmas everyone.
When I was 12 my older sister and her three sleepover friends thought a cruel demeaning prank was to hold me down and take in turns to moon right in my face. The memory means I've never had to look at porn.
"I filled in a retirement planning tool that tells you how much money you'll have when you retire. I am fucked, but probably so are you."
I hit the break glass fire alarm for japes at the White Oaks leisure centre in Swanley when I was 7 or 8. It was a freezing night and everyone had to get out the pool and muster in the car park. Someone got pneumonia for sure
"I despise my ex, for who he is and everything he's done. But my banking password is still our safe word, so that when I log in I am reminded that for all his many failings he was bloody amazing in bed."
When I deposit money into my William Hill betting account it comes up on my bank statement as WHO - The wife quizzed me about this and I told her it's a charity donation to the World Health Organisation. I now deposit the same amount on a monthly basis to make it look legit
"Every time we go on family holidays abroad, I always put my stash of drugs in my Mum's handbag or coat pocket as we go through customs"
"I found a glass vial necklace in my brothers room containing what I thought was cocaine so bumped a bit, turns out it was his dead dog's ashes."
On one day of each week I like to drink a litre of beetroot juice. It makes my pee pink and my poo purple. It is the most fun you can have with your digestive system
"Every time I buy a coffee from greggs I will take 4 sugars but will only use 1, I empty them into a jar at home. Not bought sugar for years."
When I was a kid I made my little sister eat my snot and drink a cup full of piss or else Santa wouldn't come this year Also used to make her headbutt the wall before she could watch TV on a Saturday morning. She's turned out much better than me as an adult
"My wife thinks I'm more into football than I am, when she watches those bakeoff type shows about sewing and pottery, I'll sit on the sofa with a game on my phone and headphones in, it feels more polite if she thinks I care about a game than the audiobook I'm really listening to"
My piss smells of mushroom soup and I don't know what to do
"I'm in my late 30s now, with a pregnant wife and so don't get the chance to get stoned as much as in my younger days. I have realised that each time I do now the song 'Hello by Oasis plays in my head without fail. What happened to the life i knew?"
"My wife can't 'commune' with me while there's washing up in the sink. I could leave it there for days. When I'm in the mood, I hide dirty crockery in the garage."
When Mary Anne Hobbs says You're locked on to BBC Radio 6 I turn the radio off until 1pm just to prove I am not

"I don't often wank about celebrities, but when I do, I have to engineer a plausible backstory for myself about how we even ended up in the same room."
"Was selling a house, there was a hole in the roof, leaked in to loft and on bedroom ceiling. Buyers sent a roofer round to check roof, idiots sent him in the evening, it was getting dark. Roofer and I agreed on £50 and he wrote a favourable report. House sold. No guilt."
I will randomly beep my car horn whist sat in traffic. Then frantically look around so no one would suspect it's me who has just beeped.
Recently found out that the time in 2004 when I turned down the offer to come back to my friends house with her fit mate after a night out was not to have a drunk swim in her pool but was in fact an invite for a threesome. Both are now married and Im dead inside.
"At uni, I drunkenly tried to seduce the ticket man when I couldn't afford the ticket on the last train home. Literally ran my hand up his leg. He booted me off at the next station where I sat for over an hour waiting for my housemate to pick me up."
As a teen in Wales in the 90's I tried to sabotage a live taping of Songs of Praise by pulling out random wires in the tech control room.
"I like to play Call of Duty online, I name my gun's after Coronation Street characters and have done for over 10 years. I currently have a 1000+ kills with 'Gail Platt', I'm also a big fan of 'Peter Barlow' for long range kills."
"When I was a kid, I made a Lego submarine for some daddy long legs I captured one late autumn. However, upon it's maiden voyage in the bath it sprung a leak so I committed what must have felt like some kind of mass genocide. I still dream about it now in my 50s."
I know it's wrong but the 20p bag for life from the supermarket makes an excellent kitchen bin bag. The thin ones always needed to be double bagged
I pretty much always start the new toothpaste before the old one has run out. Just seems so desperate squeezing every last drop out of an almost spent tube when there's a fresh one right there on the shelf.
"Around twice a month I book a room at the Travelodge down the road and just lie in bed eating pizza, burgers, chocolate, any junk food really. My wife thinks I regularly attend important business meetings but I'm actually just a fat mess."
I record all my farts through the day on my phone and play them back when I feel depressed. The recording is over four hours long now. I am 60.
An otolaryngologist once dug deep and removed the most spectacular chunk of wax from my ear; twice the size of anything I've mined for myself. I think about it all the time. I wish I'd had the confidence to ask to take it home with me.
My nose runs when I empty my knackers. The more I stamp on the toothpaste the worse it gets. Really annoying on a good shagging sesh and I've let it drip on her before. Almost impossible to get away with having a wank these days unless it's hayfever/cold season
Over the last few years I have eaten sticks of deodorant. I do it secretly while sitting on the toilet. No one knows and husband always wonders where his deodorant has gone
"Me and one of my friends filmed a homemade 20 minute long porn video just for fun, but I deleted it the next morning after remembering that I share an iCloud with my dad"
"To encourage our resue pound puppy to pee outside, I took him to the corner of the yard and peed in the garden in front of him. It seems to work."

I once caught a well known soap actress getting fingered in the isle of her local Blockbuster Video and had to kick her and her boyfriend out while pretending to not know who she was even though it was OBVIOUS.
90% of my job is knowing the correct terms to Google.
"Once when I moved I pretend I was still a roofer when going to the pub after work, I would go home and get changed out of my suit into my old work gear. It was because I felt more comfortable talking to other workmen then the people in business clothing at the bar."
Since we've both been working from home I've overhead my wife on a number of calls managing a small team about really dull boring things but I find it incredibly sexy seeing her wear reading glasses and say things like if we don't get the update I'll need to inform Claire
"In Year 8 and 9 at school, I used to draw swastikas on school tables and books, laughing while I did. We had awful history classes at the time and so I really had no idea of the connotations of what I was doing. But I am mortified on the occasions that I remember I ever did it."
I find sending Christmas cards tedious in the extreme.I tell people that I have donated to a local food bank instead. This is a lie.
Whenever anyone asks what I do for a living I say I work in 'online retail' . I actually sell drugs on the darknet so it's kind of true
When I get mashed potato for tea I still like to use my fork to plough the field into nice furrows. I've been doing this 40 years
"As a teenager I invented a dice game to help me decide which girl in my class to think about during my next wank. Different rolls would give you the girl, what she was wearing and where we would be kissing. I think Stacey in her blue coat behind the Maths block was my favourite."
I'm a raging pirate and enjoy running a server just to share movies and TV shows. I take particular satisfaction in sharing content from Amazon Prime Video because Jeff Bezos is such an utter cunt.
My wife doesn't understand how I'm not losing weight. I get high and eat butter with a spoon after she's gone to bed.
"I used to regularly get up in the middle of the night and eat my housemates food, he angrily confronted me about it one day. I apologized and bought him a tub of ice cream as a gesture of peace. I got up that night and ate the ice cream, then blamed it on another housemate."
"If a vehicle with commercial signage cuts me up, pulls out in front of me, or otherwise pisses me off, I look them up online and leave 1 star reviews on Trustpilot, Google, etc."
I took a batch of cakes into work thinking I'd cheer everyone up and share. Within half an hour they had all got on my tits so much that I ate them all myself. Each time I unclipped the lid someone looked round expectantly. Shouldn't be such twunts. Get your own cakes.
As a 5th grader I faked a belly ache to get out of a maths test. I then followed through faking symptoms until eventually the doctors decided for an Appendectomy. My lie became a scar ⚡️
I used to work for an ISP. In my first month on the job I accidentally redirected all incoming emails for every single email account to a folder that automatically deleted them. For 2 days.
"I always cut my son's pizzas into 8 pieces, then before I give it them, I eat a slice from each pizza, they've never noticed,"

I used to WFH 1 day a week as an informal agreement between me & my boss. I was just about to ask to increase it to 2 days when my boss changed for someone in Germany. I just extended it to 2-3 without telling anyone & told my new Boss that was what I always did. Worked a treat.
I once poured a beer in a friends washing machine where you would usually put the comfort. He told me that his mrs was raging that their clothes were stinking off beer. I blamed a friend as I'm already the most disliked one in the group.
"I once let my 3 year old try some of my spicy bbq dip & to put it lightly he didn't like it. Since then I've told him anything I'm eating That I don't want to share is spicy! Chocolate, jelly babies you name it. He's nearly 5 now & hasn't realised yet."
I've recently started going for a poo without the accompaniment of a phone or book.
"Just pooing, whilst looking into space and contemplating ones own mortality."
Truly uplifting.
"In my social circle i'm known as the tea guy. I have a huge collection of exotic teas, friends always buy me new teas for bday/xmas. But i fucking hate tea, i never drink it, coffee is way better but i'm too afraid to come out and say"
"During lockdown I've been burying my post-wank jizzy tissues in the compost heap, which I've then used on the allotment to grow fruit and veg. The circle of life."
"I've just noticed that the muscles on my right forearm and tangibly larger than those on my left. Never noticed that before. I really hope it's always been like that because I'm right-handed, and not a new thing because of obvious lockdown-related activities."
"So many women complain of men with small dicks, I would do anything to be with a guy with a small appendage, I'm only little and big ones just hurt, it's not pleasant. I've ended relationships early when I've seen it and thought nope, that's just gonna cause damage."
"My workplace refused to shut during the first lockdown, so I faked the NHS text on my phone in order to stay home.Only got sick pay for the next month until they figured out working from home, but I have no regrets; the time off did wonders for my mental health."
I sometimes put blobs of my girlfriend's conditioner in my beard so it looks like I've just sucked a guy off. I'm 100% straight.
"Back in 2000, Pulp played a secret gig at the Highbury Garage. My girlfriend and I hadn't seen each other in months and talked pretty much the entire way through it. We must have been annoying as shit to everyone around us. Sorry for ruining your gig."
"Recently, I told my husband and kid to keep out of the bedroom because I was doing a secret Christmas project. For hours they stayed away, or politely knocked and spoke to me through the door if they needed anything. I was masturbating. It's been a long lockdown."
I can't walk past a Timpson without saying it in the voice of Montgomery J Burns.
"Periodically over the last 20 years I've put my mates phone number in our local free ad paper from an iPhone for £20 to free sheds, TV repairs and, obviously, mature massage services. He still doesn't suspect it's me."
I was chipping away at the ice in my freezer when the knife I was using pierced a pipe. A jet of white powder sprayed all over me. I honestly thought I might wake up to find I'd been transformed into a superhero. Didn't happen. Life sucks.
"Coming home after a week abroad with the kids, I noticed that I'd left one of the rings on the gas hob burning for the entire time. I turned it off and never told anybody. Was worried my wife would notice it was red hot til it cooled down."
Me and my girlfriend are supposed to be moving in together in to a new flat in Feb. I really don't want to so I keep picking the smallest issues with flats we look at

I always talk to Alexa using the voice of Boycie from only fools and horses. Fuck knows why.
"I worked at a Wetherspoon pub in the run-up to the Brexit referendum. Whenever the customer magazine was delivered, I dumped a load in the bin. Wasn't going to let Tim Martin spread his anti EU BS in my pub."
"My wife is at her most agreeable roughly 20 minutes after we have sex. So far this year I've successfully negotiated the purchases of a 4K telly, an Xbox and a BT Sport subscription using this tactic."
"When I was 6 and we got a 48k Spectrum with the dead flesh rubber keys, and an Interface 1 to connect up a proper kempton joystick, i rubbed some of my own shit onto the red button on the top before letting my older brother have the first go and play Atic Atac"
"When Under Pressure comes on the radio, I'm always a bit disappointed it's not Ice Ice Baby by Vanilla Ice."
"When I was a teen, my dad kept a bottle of brandy in the cupboard that he only got out at Christmas. One year I drank from it, topping it up with water. I was busted when it wouldn't light on the Christmas pudding."
"If there is cake or biscuits in the staff room at work and they get eaten super fast people always blame the heavier guy, but it's usually me. They dont suspect cause I'm thin."
I don't know which one is the pestle and which one is the mortar. I'm a 41 year old chef.
"When eBay bidding stretches beyond what I'm willing to pay, I bid it up to market rates without winning to deprive the buyer of a bargain."
I don't tweet about a shows I watch on the BBC because I don't have a TV license and I don't want them to have evidence I watch their programmes.
"We go through OXO cubes quite regularly. Purely because the rule is one cube for the pot, and one cube in my mouth. Its bloody delicious. Like a salty, beefy kiss."
So for the past month another parent and I have been exchanging flirty glances during school pick up time. Top have of her face looks great. Worried after covid once the mask is off it'll reveal something hideous and all the groundwork was for nothing.
I've become so bored and lonely throughout lockdown that I've gotten to the point that I'm having internal arguments with myself over what my favourite clothes hanger is.
"At the start of lockdown I bought a couple of ounces of weed. Since then I've been blazing solidly while WFH, yet I'm the most prolific member of my team and i just got a 10% pay rise. Fuck your lazy stoner stereotypes."
"If I see a lorry overtaking a lorry for a reason I dont justify as good enough, I quickly accelerate along side and block it, especially if a big up hill is coming up. Bit of pay back for all the times they hold us cars up."
"I'm a bit of a fatty and enjoy the odd takeaway delivery. Just before I open the front door to the driver I shout come on everyone, the takeaway is here! so that the driver thinks it's a family meal but really it's all for me. I'm sure they don't give a shit really."
Sometimes I worry that the title Readers' Wives in the various porno mags I read as a teenager probably didn't always demonstrate the correct use of apostrophes. I'm concerned there might have been a Reader's Wives or even Readers Wive's here and there.
"My dad found my old 1980's lego monorail set in his loft. Its all there. Pieces, box, instructions. Immaculate. My wife thinks its great that im going to build it for our 4 year old to play with. Am i balls. These things go for north of £500 on ebay."
"When I was about 10, I called 999 to report a pothole. I'm sorry that I wasted the time of the emergency services, but I was genuinely concerned that it would turn into a giant sinkhole like the one of seen on the news the night before."
I discovered jamming a paper clip down on my keyboard insert key with the cursor over an inbox email keeps the keyboard active. I'm showing as available in Microsoft Teams at all times and I'm taking a two hour lunch break every day.
My mother-in-law uses the 'Fruity' version of HP sauce and I secretly judge her for it.
When my teenage step son urinates on the toilet seat I use his bath towel to wipe it off
If a company uses a celebrity or song I don't like in an advert I never buy anything from them again. I haven't bought anything Nike in years because of They used Eric cantona in the adverts and won't use Tesco again because they've used a Brittany spears song in their adverts
When I can't sleep I think of ways to get away with killing the man who hit and killed my wife while speeding.
"I love and support all of my online friends, but some times I will lie to them about going to bed just so I can read a book in peace."
"I occasionally shoplift from supermarkets. Nothing big. A notebook, newspapers, magazines, a pair of trousers. I'm in my 50s, a high-earning professional. If I'm caught and prosecuted it would be disastrous. Just like the thrill."
I'm secretly excited when bad stuff happens. Covid? No deal Brexit? Love it. Not sure why.
"When I was married, I used to skim £20 from my salary into a secret account every month, just so I could buy a greggs breakfast without judgement"
When a TV show starts with a warning like 'The following program may contain adult language or themes' I automatically reply 'Cunt'.
"I'm a 5ft 1 female and would love to be taller so when I hug/kiss men they don't have to stoop. Even in heels it's ridiculous. I love standing on something, like a stair, to do these things to boost me up to their eye level."
"Shoved my wife's toothbrush up my arse when she'd seriously fucked me off one sat night. I panicked later worrying incase it was my daughters, went back and lobbed it out the window, she still worries if there's a ghost in the house wondering where my daughters toothbrush went."
I wish that people who didn't believe in the pandemic and masks etc were forced to spend a shift with us on a covid ward and hold the hands of patients as they die away from their families
"I never voted in the Brexit Referendum. Just forgot. Spent four years regretting it, but thought for sure it was a pointless exercise as no one in their right mind would want to leave."
"I put some spunk, blood, spit, hair and a few fingernails into an old yoghurt pot and have them in the freezer with a label, if I die my wife can clone me"

Only after doing a steaming guinness shit did I realise the toilets in the pub were being refurbished. The toilet was not connected to the plumbing.
I found a wallet once with a couple of hundred pounds in and cards. I took the money then handed the wallet into the police and told them I found it thrown in my garden. The man contacted me a few days later and gave me a reward for handing his cards in. I kept the reward aswell
"I'm an alcoholic and started drinking at home again five months ago. Thing is my ten cans a night is grand. Remove the stress of no pubs fights, late to work, hitting on women , no money, crashed cars etc and alcoholism is not so bad. I dread COVID ending."
I always give my shits a proud salute before flushing them away on their big journey into the world.
Spent two weekends being Santa in a Grotto....whenever parents send their kids in alone I tell them they're getting loads of expensive presents knowing that their mum or dad will panic 😂😂
"Whenever I have a 2 litre bottle of fizzy drink in the house, I have an overwhelming urge to partly crush the bottle before I put the lid back on. In my head, having less air in the bottle means it will stay fizzy and not go flat?? Yeah I'm not sure either.."
"I work in publishing. I've come to hate booksellers who are all stuck up snobs who think they're doing you a favour selling books, when in fact they take 50% of the income, and literally just put books on shelves. There's no selling involved. Buy stock, put it on shelves. Dicks."
I'm a successful financial services industry manager and at night I pull the quilt right up my chin to stop vampires biting me
Having discovered my wife was cheating I recently embarked on an affair of my own. Far from making me feel better I feel really crap about it because the girl I'm seeing is really nice and doesn't know I'm married and is inevitably going to get hurt
"I work for a weekly newspaper in a sleepy market town. I occasionally insert Weebl's Stuff-themed headlines into stories, even though hardly any of our readers will get the joke. Makes me laugh, anyway."
When I pee I always sit down and milk it out of my knob like it's a cow's udder. It's a lovely feeling and empties my bladder fully every time
"Visitors books. I find a blank space and say I had a dreadful experience due to the antics of previous guest who provided too much info in a entry. Something along the lines of 'Lovely place, ruined by the loud noise of a Belgian couple evidentially sexually abusing a dog'"
"During the first lockdown I experimented wanking with different large fruits. In essence I'd drill or cut into pineapples, melons, watermelons, squashes, aubergines etc and wank myself off with them. The more citrusy varieties required a condom to block the sting."
"I work with several very high profile bloggers & influencers on a regular basis, I have to pretend to be nice to them, and a couple actually think we're friends, but I detest every last one of them - phoney blaggers."
"The frothing noise my Nespresso machine makes is the exact same sound as the very end of Karma Police, by Radiohead. Drives my wife nuts that I robotically transition into 'Fitter...Happier...More Productive.. everytime I'm making a coffee."
My ex's family didn't have a loo brush just a toothbrush. One day I used it and without thinking put it back in the pot instead of under the sink. His dad used it the next day and realised what he'd done after it was too late. Still feel guilty.
"Last summer I ordered about £100 worth of birthday presents for my daughter. Amazon delivered them but left them right outside my front door in full view instead of in the porch specified on my account, so I logged on and told them they got nicked and got a refund."

I'm a teacher and I absolutely give students I like preferential treatment. I'll rewrite huge bits of coursework if you're one of my faves. The others can fuck off.
"At uni, mates & me shared a flat opposite a ‘sauna'. Any time we saw a punter pacing up & down outside whilst folk walked past, we'd open the window & shout stuff like Hookers are just through the blue door, mate, or if we saw a one coming out, it was Top shagger! Poor guys."
I was once paid to plan a new 'celebratory walking route' by Transport for London to celebrate the Queens Jubilee 2012. There's a mistake on the map/route which means it technically can't be completed. Nobody has ever complained.
"I stood behind a prominent right wing spokesperson at the match once, with the help of my mates I was able to piss on his cream stone island jacket and seat when the mighty Luton scored. Can't stand him"
"If I make me and my kids microwave instant noodles for lunch, after we've eaten I tell them I'm going to pour the bowl of leftover noodle juice and tiny bits of noodle into the dog's dish. But I wait till everyone's out the room and I drink it myself, straight from the bowl."
For four years I've signed off turgid complicated compliance documents with my job title deliberately spelt wrong. 'Anal cyst' instead of 'Analyst'. Nobody has ever noticed in my company or the regulator. And we think we have enough safeguards to prevent another banking crisis.
The advent of a paperless society has helped me fiddle loads of expenses with my company. I simply adjust the figures in the emails before screenshotting them and attaching the screenshot as the receipt on my expenses claim
"Had my laptop on the sofa during a organisation wide Zoom meeting with 800+ people. Must have accidentally turned my camera on, and now everyone knows me as the guy who picks skin off my feet and eats it."
"I once said, in a travel bookshop, do you know if there are any real bookshops round here? I still cringe over ten years later."
"I'm senior manager of a manufacturing company. I don't know a great deal and I constantly have people asking me questions, most of my replies are along the lines of What would you do? and then I agree with their approach. 2 years on, it's still going well."
Went to the barbers. After a restyle so had a photo on my phone. Proceed open photo app to show my barber. My most recent picture was of my penis. Everything inside me died.
"I work at a post office. If what you are sending is millimetres/grams over the bandwidth, we have to charge you extra, and we love doing it every single time. Never gets old"
"I say I don't know why I'm not losing weight, but it's because whenever I am alone in the house I eat loads of chocolate from my secret stash and hide the wrappers in the outside bin."
When I brush the hair of my dogs I decided to keep the fur in a little box just in case you can reanimate them after they die in the future. You never know.
Had a one night stand with a stranger at a conference in Bicester just before Christmas 5 years ago. Never got his contact details and my daughter turned four in October. Breaks my heart that she'll never know her dad because I was too horny and then too shy to get a number
When feelings of anger come towards my ex I google his company name and click on the sponsored links repeatedly so it costs him money. Makes me feel better about all the mental trauma he put me through
WILL SOMEONE TELL MY WIFE TO STOP PAINTING? OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR SHE HAS TURNED OUR HOUSE INTO A TACKY EMBARRASSMENT WITH GOD AWFUL DECOR CHOICES AND SHIT CANVASES. THANK GOD FOR COVID AND NO VISITORS.

My biggest regret is that my when my unwell dog finally came to be put down i didn't go say goodbye to him because i was too lazy to get out of bed
"I hate how my wife decorates the Christmas tree, I would never say anything to her as it brings her more joy than anything else but it is always so bloody ugly it makes me embarrassed."
I love my grandma but as a person she's just the worst. Rude and ignorant. She's in her 90s and takes no pleasure from life. Just waddles around like an angry twat. Wish we could afford that death clinic in Switzerland.
"My wife and I had a Twitter account where we posted graphic nudes of ourselves and built up 45K followers. A picture of her would gain followers, a pic of me would lose followers. But I carried on regardless."
I'm a creative writing tutor and I once asked a class of white middle-class adults to compose a rap. There was a great disturbance in the Force that night.
"I have noticed that during different phases of my menstrual cycle I feel more attracted to men or women. For example during my period I can't stop thinking about sex with men, then when I'm ovulating I can't stop thinking about sex with women."
"The amount of time I spend on the phone gets measured at work, so if I call someone and can't get through, I'll leave the longest blank voicemail I can so the time counts in my stats. Usually I just put the phone on mute and let it record"
I have a secret IPlayer account and after everybody has gone to bed I use it to watch Hey Duggee
"Used to work in the Mars factory, was once on the Revels line and the machine jammed up. I used my finger to unblock it - a huge no-no - losing a chunk off the top in the process. I couldn't tell anyone for fear of losing my job. I always wonder which lucky person got that treat"
In charge of transferring &gt;15k staff from one pay system to another and devised a pro forma to make the transfer 'easier' for my staff to calculate the transfer salaries. I missed two points off each of the grades giving 1000's of staff an instant £3k pay rise. No one complained
"At the start of the first lockdown my friend / housemate of 5 years suddenly became one of those people that whistles. It's loud and and often right outside my bedroom door. I don't want to upset him by saying how annoying it is, so I'm just going to move out."
"I farted once when my BF was down on me, I knew it, he knew it, neither of us said anything, and he carried on, what a man, what a legend, and this is why he is now my husband"
"I'm a Maths teacher at a Primary School. A few years back one of my students said that Maths was pointless and that I was wasting my life, so in revenge I told the Headteacher that he'd made inappropriate remarks towards me and he was suspended for 2 weeks."
I'm a 38 year old man and I'm genuinely terrified of my washing machine when it's on a full fast spin. 
I can't be in the same room incase it falls apart and the drum acts as shrapnel and kills me.
I put the tv volume on 13 to annoy everyone who watches tv with me.
My missus and I were getting down to business after an episode of the Handmaid's Tale. As I pried her legs apart I said may the lord open. As soon as the words left my mouth I realised it was the worst thing I'd ever said. The following sex was extremely awkward.
Working in the building trade when I buy from builders merchants if the guys in yard don't help me load van I always put a few extra items in.

"Destroyed a woman's white carpet by stepping in a black resin while laying a floor. Realising what I done,I grabbed her dog, dipped its paws in it and let it run wild."
"My boyfriend thinks Lindsay Lohan has a twin sister, because of Parent Trap, and thinks it's a shame only one of them went on to do well. He is 26."
"My wife and in-laws are absolutely besides themselves about a new baby in the family gushing about how beautiful it is. I mean... it's fine. Not as hideous as some kids, but really it's average at best tbh."
"I have the same name as a famous actor, now deceased, and in 1997 was accidentally given some royalties meant for him. It wasn't much, but it continued annually until the mistake was finally discovered in 2016. Pity, it was a useful little income stream."
"After cooking sausages I dip my facemask into the fat, and going shopping smells amazing."
I record every time I have sex with my partner in a spreadsheet. Coming up on our first century - not sure whether I should tell her so we can celebrate the occasion.
"My boyfriend and I have found a new hobby - farting on our cat. It's hilarious, plus he deserves it cos he's a dick."
"I have a stash of asparagus which has been cooked, chopped and frozen which I hide in my kids meals just so they freak out about their pee smelling weird."
From an early age my daughter has shared her bed with a number of stuffed Pandas. I've given them all silly voices and personalities as part of her bedtime routine. Nowadays she mostly puts herself to bed and I am sad because I've grown very fond of my creations. Goodnight Pandas
My first girfriend gave me a blow job almost every single day. I had no idea how lucky I was and assumed this was the norm. I will regret dumping her to my dying day.
When my wife and I started dating I promised myself I would never let rip in her presence. 10 years later and I'll fart like a train in front of her as if it's the most normal thing in the world.
I deliberately underdress my 4 yr old for trips to the playground so she gets cold after 20 mins and wants to go home. It's just I hate the inane small minded chat I'm subjected to by other mothers.
"I always exaggerate the length of my period for a few days to avoid sex with my husband. He's wonderful, I just can't be arsed."
"Since getting COVID 2 months ago my sense of smell/taste still hasn't returned, therefore I give my husband a blowjob every morning and i think it saved my marriage as he now does so many jobs around the house as a reward for me"
I've had a PS5 since launch day and I've barely used it. Sorry everyone who can't get one.
Unbeknownst to the rest of my family I call our cat Ruby despite the fact the rest of them call him Dave. I just don't think it's an appropriate name for a cat and I don't find it in the least bit funny. But that's my family in a nutshell - unfunny cunts with a cat called Dave.
"When I was 10 years old, I conducted an experiment so see whether wearing 10 pairs of underpants and pissing myself would contain all the fluid. It didn't. In embarrassment I threw all 10 piss soaked pants behind my wardrobe only to be discovered by my mum later."

When I was 9 I ate the shiny paper you get around a stick of chewing gum to see if it would come out the same the other end. It did. I repeat the same trick now once a year to see if my system's still working. So far so good.

I can't stand The Sun newspaper and its abhorrent views but I actively seek adverts from the rag online to minutely chip away at its funds and limit its funding reach.
Bought a mini for 50quid off a bloke in a pub in Epsom in 1988. Drove it home the next day. Stalled at the lights on streatham high street. Got out and left it there
Every year me & the wife go to Portugal on holiday. We spend the week feeding the stray cats & kittens. Better than sunbathing or sightseeing all day long.
We broke up two years ago and I'm still devastated but being able to fart freely around the house is a plus.
"On my 48th birthday, January 2020, I decided to learn the guitar. "
"It's been one of the best decisions I've ever had. It calms me down, I'm learning a skill and I can see myself definitely improving, but best of all, it annoys the fuck out of the wife."
"I'm told my cooking tastes amazing, but I'm a very average cook with a few solid recipes... I do however have a big bag of MSG and a spoonful goes in everything I cook"
"I once worked in a pub where the landlord really pissed me off one evening, so I served my mates two for the price of one for the rest of the night. There were 15 of them in and all liked booze. My colleague got the blame for the till being down."
In the 90's had a minor accident when my car was hit by someone else. Insurance wrote it off but allowed me to buy it at scrap value. Got £1500 and had the unrepaired car back on the road.
"When struggling to sleep at night, I lie thinking about all my ex sexual partners, it's better than counting sheep and doesn't take as long"
I keep chocolate in the freezer because it is tastier and has a really nice crunch. I believe it is optimal. My wife lost a filling in some dairy milk last week.
"I thought the little bag of coal my wife got me as a joke Christmas present was some sort of novelty confectionary. It was in fact real coal, as I found out when my brand new crown snapped off."
I only read the school newsletter so I can find out which kids have been naughty.
Someone at work who I bitterly detest has gotten really fat this year and I'm delighted.
As a classic 80's latchkey kid I'd come home hungry from school. One of my favourite snacks was chewing up a ryveta cracker then spreading it on another one. I had no idea we were poor.

"Daughter thinks I'm being really supportive because I let her shave her head. In reality, it's just one less person's hair to pull out the plug hole. Doesn't suit her at all, looks like a kiwi fruit."
"Found my brother had bought a bottle of gamer girl bath water, the fucking weirdo. Poured it down the drain and replaced it with water from the tap, and little bit of piss as well to serve him right"
"When I was 21 I ate nothing but hard boiled eggs for a week to see how bad my farts would get. Truly putrid, the stuff of legend. I want to do it again and beat my record, but now I have a wife and two kids and I'd never be able to get away with it"
"Back in the mid-1980s when we were about 10 me and my friends would use phoneboxes to call the operator and would ask to be connected to 'the fart house'. We could barely make it to the end of the sentence before cracking up. Ahh, simpler times."
"My wife used to grumble about toast crumbs in the marge tub, so now I just lick the knife before a second dip. She's not on Twitter, so she can fuck all the way off."
At the peak of my dry patch mid twenties a girl I worked with told me she'd had a had a sex dream about me the night before. I immediately apologised to her and was too embarrassed to talk to her for a week. Yep I was that awkward.
On three occasions our Broccoli has been delivered with a live caterpillar on it. I haven't told my wife as she's already a fussy enough eater; I just put the bug in the garden and boil the broccoli for a bit longer when it comes to it.
"When I was 20, I went on a date with a girl. During sex later I repeatedly kissed and sucked on her nose, as an experiment in new erotica. I am 39, just recalled this and I shuddered at the embarrassment. There was no second date."
Got told my cock was massive on Omegle so set up an onlyfans page and now paying for a holiday for my wife and kids. They have no idea where the money has come from.
My 8 year old son has not asked for any lego stars wars this year and I'm very disappointed I won't be on build duty on xmas day.
I once accidentally got some shit on my mate's bathroom mat. Tried wiping it off but it got worse so I flipped it over. He's just moved house and I have no idea if he's seen it or not.
"I wrote down my fav pornstars' names on a pad, GF found it, & I lied it was work colleagues for an Xmas card list. Had to follow through and send off 15 cards to random addresses."
Looked the Jesus on E's Amiga demo and now YouTube belives I'm religious. I'm fucking not.
"I attended a wedding last summer where I had shagged seven female guests previously at uni. It should've been a glorious smug day chatting to their partners, but spent the whole day terrified my wife would enter a conversation with them and they'd all exchange notes and stuff."
I never miss an opportunity to sing 'Fuck the pain away' instead of 'Dance your cares away' when I hear the theme tune to Fraggle Rock.
"I complained to the council about the removal of a payphone, they argued and now it's staying. I said I needed it because I couldn't afford a mobile, truth is my drugs are ordered from there."
"Every time my kitten has a treat I'll pop one in my mouth aswell discreetly, the cheese ones are to die for!"

"Years ago, I dented another car in a car park, was seen doing it, so made a big show of leaving a note on the windscreen, except I left a fake name & phone number. Recently, exactly the same thing happened to my car: Dent, note, fake number. Karma catches up with you in the end."
"When I was about ten, I found £140 in cash on the pavement. Handed it in and it got returned to owner. They never gave me any reward. This was now 40 years ago but every day I still think they're fucking BASTARDS."
I keep the latest copy of Private Eye by the loo. I don't read it. I don't think its funny but I do think it makes me look more interesting.
Drinking the starch water left behind from boiling rice/pasta is my favourite treat of the week.
"As a married woman, I'm desperate to try anal but I don't want my husband to get his own way, so I use his hairbrush when he's at work"
Sometimes I put a McVitie's Hobnob in the bottom of my bowl of cornflakes so I can have it as a treat at the end when the milk had made it go soft. #SoggyBiscuit
I live in constant fear of the secrets I'll reveal if I develop dementia in later life
"When buying my niece and nephew presents, I make things easy by just choosing the toys I want to play with the most."
I've started watching Taskmaster and I'm enjoying it so much that I have set myself Tasks at home. They are all wanking tasks really but I always give myself 5pts.
"I work for a family owned business of racist, right wing Brexiteers who do most of their business in Europe. It's just hitting home how leaving is going to hurt them. I hope their business fails even if it costs me my job in the process."
"I have sebaceous prominence, tiny white speckles on my dick and balls. Didn't lose my virginity until I was 20 because of them. Turns out girls couldn't care less and will happily blow a lightly spotted dick."
At university I was very shy. One day one of the cool students asked me how I was. For some unknown and bizarre reason I said I was sad because my goldfish died. When I got home I found out my goldfish had died. I'm sorry Frederica.
"My wife and I guess what shape the chocolate is in the advent calendar, and whoever guesses correctly gets to eat it. Last year I got my mate to buy the same calendar, and he'd leak the shape to me every morning. I won 24 times."
"Was a teenager when I read Frankie Boyle's autobiog a few years back, just as I started beating it. He has a bit about how his Catholic upbringing meant he could never wank to any married woman... I'm not even Catholic, why did my 12 y/o self internalise this as a rule for life?"
My boss is an absolute twat but because of the pandemic he's had to supply us all with KN95 masks. I steal one or sometimes two boxes a day and donate them to the NHS. My wife thinks I'm Robin fucking Hood and our sex life has been much more interesting lately. Thanks Covid-19!
"I really liked my long post lockdown locks but I have had my hair cut short again because when my barber asks what I want, the only option I know is number 4 back and sides, short on top."
"I love my girlfriend, but I hate her parents with a burning passion. If we'd been together for a couple of months and then I met them I'd split up with her just so I never have to be in their company again. But after so many years together I can't do that to her."

The Oh My Lord bit of Mary's Boy Child by Boney M is so joyous and celebratory that it almost makes me want to believe in God and Jesus and all that stuff.
As a kid we did a school fundraiser selling chocolate bars. I didn't steal the cash as such but never got round to handing it in. I buried the money with my Maradona collectors card as penance but the guilt returns afresh whenever near the site.
"For an embarrassingly long time, I thought that hit-and-run referred to incidents where a driver got out of their car, punched someone and then ran off. I always wondered what happened to their abandoned car in these situations."
The head of my division's dad died and I put £100 that I couldn't afford in to the collection knowing his assistant would secretly tell him. 2 months later he put me forward for a promotion and I got a 30k pay rise. Best investment ever!

"I've had sex with my wife 3 times in 5 years. It's sad & there's no connection between us beyond parent duties. I won't leave until we're both able to be financially independent though, I'm not a total bastard."
Whenever I walk across gravel I all of a sudden turn into a goose-stepping Nazi entering some sleepy French village on my way to conquer Paris.
"Contactless payment on my phone only works about half the time, but shops seems happy as long as it beeps, so I get free stuff"
My partner thinks I keep a couple of our kids' dinosaurs on my desk cos they remind me of them while I work. The real reason is the big one is a good back scratcher and the small one's tail I use to clean my ears.
"My career has turned to shit, and my family life is a mess. The only part of my life that I have any control over is my exercise regime, and I have become obsessed with it. Lots of people complement me on how buff I am looking, but for me, it is just evidence of my failure."
"My house has only 1 bathroom, so when it's being used I go beside the house and pee in the walkway between mine and my neighbor's house. Sometimes I write my name on their window."
"On a rainy Saturday afternoon a few years after leaving school, I spotted my school bully walking into town arm in arm with his girlfriend. Sensing an opportunity too good to miss I hit the large puddle in my car at speed and he took a direct to the skin soaking."
"As a middle-aged man, I've come to derive such pleasure from bleeding the radiators in my home. The sound of the air escaping feels like my house is finally expelling trapped wind, and believe me I know how good that feels."
"In my youth, I was a failed musician but had a side-gig remixing other people's tracks which went much, much better, mainly because I was well handy with a sampler. Bottom line, if you were a clubber in the 90's/early 00s, there's a really good chance you danced to my farts."
I get really annoyed around the neighbourhood by people who let their bushes grow over the pavement. I send them fake letters from the council quoting made up by-laws they have broken and threatening them with legal action unless the cut them back. Works everytime.
I was well into my mid 20's before I realised that you're not meant to eat the red wax coating on gourmet cheeses.
"I buy multi packs of bic biros simply because the prong on the cap is perfect for removing ear wax. I have many, many biros now."
"Whenever I open a fresh packet of biscuits I make sure to leave a few and ration them to the wife over the next few days, that way when they're gone it's because we ate them, and not the fact after she goes to bed I have a wank and reward myself by eating lots of biscuits."

"As a 12 yr old, I shoplifted The Joy Of Sex from a local shop leaving the store with it, ironically, shoved down my trousers. Whilst informative, it was disappointing as it just pencil drawings of a particularly hairy couple. I'm still troubled by the theft and the pictures"
"I lived in my current house for 7 years, every Christmas I get a card from Dorothy with £40 in it and A message which reads Happy Christmas Richard hope the family is well, treat yourself to something nice My names James but I'm happy with the £40, God knows who Dorothy is?"
"I'm a lettings agent, but I'm also a socialist who hates landlords. I therefore take every opportunity to negotiate cheaper rents for tenants."
"I put food in the foodbank collection box in the supermarket without paying for it. It's not stealing, I'm just moving food around the shop, if they don't out it back it is on them."
People think I'm a big cheese connoisseur. But all I eat at home is mild cheddar.
"If I'm working with someone I dislike, I often write offensive words in the email and change the colour to white so they can't see it. Haven't been caught yet but when I do..."
My dad gave me £100 to take my uni corridor mates out for a curry to celebrate my birthday. I spent it all on magic mushrooms and went to see Keith Harris and Orville. I woke up in hospital with an injury that has scarred my face permanently. No idea what happened.
I have fucked hookers bareback and snorted lots of drugs all over the world and still lived to tell the tale. I will take my chances with a vaccine that's been made in a lab by experts.
"I work on construction sites - which, as a woman, can be quite intimidating. When I know I'm headed for an argument with a contractor, I wear lace suspenders and silk stockings under my trousers because it makes me feel powerful and I know they'd crumbled into putty if they knew"
I feel like I've passed my peak. I wish I'd hooked up more when I was hotter.
"I write tasting notes for a well known whisky retailer's website. It's all a load of bollocks and might as well be Sarson's, but customers buy it so what the hell. I'd rather have a Bell's and coke, please."
I used to waste time repeatedly flushing to clear a little floater or the odd errant pea. Discovered it's much easier and quicker to push the offending item down and round the bend. Wash your hands afterwards as usual of course. You can thank me later.
I'm 38 and I thought Ruby Wax was a character on telly like Alan Partridge or David Brent. I heard her talking about her book on the radio and googled her. She's just straight up like that.
I was surprised to discover that the male had something to do with pregnancy because the husbands on early 70s TV always appeared shocked at the announcement.
Thursdays are my favourite day to do the school run. My daughter has a flute lesson this day so I get to carry her instrument case. I imagine that I'm an international assassin off on a mission and in the case is my sniper rifle. Puts me in a great mood for the day.
My asshole brother-in-law once told me he got the good looking sister. I've always regretted not being quick thinking enough to invent a story that I got the one that gave the best blow jobs. I've since found out I was right. Fuck you brother in law.

I tell people I am donating to charity instead of sending Christmas cards. Made a big fuss about it. No cards sent for five years. No money donated either.
"I work for a cosmetics company and there is no difference between day and night cream, save you money, buy the cheapest"
If somebody in a ridiculously oversized car is driving like an idiot behind me I slow down to about 85% of the speed limit and drive extremely carefully. I love the thought of their desperately unloved ego going through the torment of being forced to drive properly.
I used to think ground coffee was coffee grown in the ground.
"I worked for the Vote Leave campaign and actively promoted the idea of the UK leaving the EU even though I knew it was a terrible idea. I never thought we would win, I feel really ashamed."
"My wife's considering refusing the Covid vaccine on the usual spurious grounds. What she doesn't know is that I'll divorce her, on the grounds of extreme stupidity and selfishness, if she carries through with her anti-science stance."
My partner insisted on keeping her iPod dock despite us having a house full of Alexa speakers and her iPod not leaving the car for over 5 years.
"She thinks it's in the attic but I threw it in the bin, saving myself 10 years of it living in the attic, to then be thrown in the bin."
"It wasn't until I was in my thirties that I found out there was no such song called Memories from Cats, it's just Memories from the musical Cats."
"I started pretending to be a Trump supporter online to raise money for myself, it's pretty lucrative and I'm not even American. I just think about what brexiters want to hear then change a few words around. I wish I had been doing it for years."
"When I run upstairs wearing my dressing gown, I always hold my penis to stop it flolloping about too much. The balls are fine though as my sack is still quite taught. Like a fisherman's full net after a good catch."
"At Scout camp I did a massive poo in the forest, then invited the others in my troop to look at this massive poo I happened to find. They easily figured it was me and I got bullied for being disgusting, again."
"When I put the shopping away or empty the dishwasher, I put it all on the lower shelves of the fridge/cupboards regardless of where it belongs, or actually fits. I tell my husband it's because that's all I can reach, but that's a lie. It's just to make sure he always does it."
"I am a keen photographer, and was asked to take the photos at my daughter's school prom. I used Photoshop to edit the pictures of the girl who bullied my daughter, and made her look fat."
I train & handle drug sniffer dogs for the Navy. Once spent several days turning over a battleship from top to bottom after the dog kept giving clear sign. Truth is I'd realised a couple of hours in I'd brought the explosives dog by mistake but it'd gone too far by then
I use my local authority's car parks several times a week but never buy a ticket. I figure the odd
I hated art at school. For my homework I resubmitted the same three bits of work all year that got high marks by cutting them out and sticking them back in my art book again. By the end of the year they were each 10 pages thick but the teacher didn't seem to realise.

When I was a student I coveted a mixer tap. I've got one now. My wife can't be arsed to run the cold water and every day I get tea that tastes of the hot water tank. Mixer taps are literally the worst thing in my life.
I got a job as a graphic designer by accident a few months ago. I meant to apply for a different role and managed to blag through the interview. I have put all my work through Fiverr and pocketed a nice bit of money on top. I'm fucked with this vaccine

"Used to work for Kellogg. Had to quit, as they kept referring to the product as 'food', I just couldn't get all jazz hands about a bunch of puffed rice, coated in cheap chocolate, shamelessly marketed at kids. Even when I worked there I bought own brand stuff."
"45 years ago aged about 8, my older sister and I lied to our mum about a man coming into our back garden for no reason at all. The police were called and neighbours were questioned. For months, we had regular police visits to check all was OK. We never spoke about it afterwards."
I used to work at the London Olympics committee offices and I stole so much merchandise. My house is full of Wenlock and Mandeville branded homeware.
"I'm sick of my downstairs neighbour not being in when her multiple parcels arrive each day so I've started telling the couriers that I'm not allowed to sign for them for legal reasons. She can go and collect her eBay tat from the depot, I'm not her bloody concierge."
My partner prides himself on boasting how he's collected thousands of Nectar points for about a decade and will trade them for a massive TV one day soon. I've used them all on cheap Pizza Express vouchers when I go out with mates.
"I broke my girlfriend's v expensive John Lewis vase and replaced it with one from Tesco's which cost £4.50, she hasn't noticed."
I've just realised when I fart it sounds a lot like the tone of my father's. I've inherited his arsehole.
Until I was 30 I thought that CID stood for Constables In Disguise.
My spirits were lifted a little earlier when I realised that as 3 more of my relatives had died this year I wouldn't have to go to the effort of sending them a Christmas card.
My wife says that I care more for my dog than my kids. She's right - I often daydream about the lot of them fucking off and me and the dog living on a canal boat in peace.
"My older brother tripped me up outside Co-op Living and laughed at my nosebleed, so later when we went into the Romford computer shop in South Street I stuck my finger up my bumhole and wiped it on the Oric Atmos joystick before he started playing Mr Wimpy. I was 6."
Lived in Germany for a year. I'd often see signs pointing to 'Einbahnstrasse'. Took me 6 months before I realised this meant 'one way street' and was not as I thought pointing to some famous Roman road or something. I speak German
"Once was having a nap with my then girlfriend, both woke up at the same time, said 'hey you' she replied 'i love you too', relationship lasted a few more months before ending, kept up the charade didn't want to be a dickhead"

My wife's isolating with Covid and has lost all sense of taste. I'm using it as an opportunity to feed her all the disgusting SlimmingWorld ready meals she bulk bought months ago and then refused to eat. Hello freezer space!
I cultivate my son's friendships based on how much I'd like to shag the other kid's mum
I like to change gears really quickly and pretend I'm driving an automatic.
"I don't really fancy my husband anymore and we stay together because it's convenient and when we fuck I either pretend he's Wolf from Gladiator, Eddie Shoestring from the detective drama Shoestring or, more often, think about the gas bill."
"When I was 17, I went to my then girlfriend's 18th birthday party at the local village hall. Strolled in, dumped her, left her in tears, went home. It was over 30 years ago, and I feel horrible about it still. But she dodged a bullet tbh"
"Sorry Michael, it was me that dented the back of your car when I accidentally reversed into it; not your elderly next door neighbour who you reported to the police"
"Sold scratch cards for our 2nd division football team, and would scratch a 1mm line in the win section to tell if ticket was a winner or not. Nobody I sold to ever won anything. I, on the other hand, won a season ticket and made a tidy sum."
"I rarely receive messages from friends these days. When I do, I like to leave them unopened for a few hours so I can bask in the warmth of the message icon on my phone and feel like a popular, normal, functioning human being."
"For years I thought that the lack of lines on Kylie's face was down to exceptional Minogue genetics, because it's exactly the same for Dannii. My wife set me right."
I just dislodged a popcorn husk from the gum right at the back of my mouth. I had no idea it was there up till 4 days ago. It was black and stank. I brush and floss Religiously. The last time I ate popcorn was about 4 months ago when I saw Tenet.
My friend and me are in our late 20's and every week we go to the local park late at night and play on the swings and climbing frames. It's great fun.
"Until The Mandalorian came out, I thought Yoda was just what happened when a Jedi got really, really old."

"My life as a well-functioning adult hangs by a thread, based on whether I can hold off downloading Football Manager. I did it from 19-24, then slipped for 4 years, and now have been 'clean' again for about 6 years. But it could all come crashing down any time & I live in fear."

I get so excited when I find very expired eggs in the fridge. I covertly sneak them out of the house and go for a drive launching them at targets pretending they are grenades. I've started hiding them behind things so they go out of date to do it more.
"I like to listen to an upbeat playlist of classic TV theme tunes while I'm driving. I constantly worry that one day I'll be in a horrific crash, the music doesn't stop, and my dying vision will be of a firefighter trying to cut me from the wreckage, to the Grange Hill music"
I discovered I still had the login to my ex's parents Asda shopping account and would add a small extra item as a treat.

"I work for an energy company serv/repairing boilers. Xmas is the best time of year when kids ask what is the man doing. I reply checking the readings it's the lie box for your house, have you told lies before Santa finds out? The horror on the kids face every time never fails"

About 20 years ago I emptied a whole McDonald's strawberry milkshake into a post box for no real reason at all. Every time I walk past one now I feel guilty.
I had intended using my VPN for all sorts of naughty things online but in reality I just have a spliff and watch Irish TV. It's fantastic!
Everyone agrees that my famous poppy and orange sponge cake is fabulous. I said I got the secret recipe from a grateful old granny I did some work for. I sure did -- she told me about a packet mix from the supermarket. Her secret is now mine!
I phone up pirate radio stations as a care worker getting them to dedications for 80 years olds in old folks homes who used to go to raves in the early 90s. All fake but the DJs love it and in theory it could be genuine
I've started a whole new Netflix account to secretly watch ahead on box sets as my wife only wants to watch one episode every other week. It's torture when I have to rewatch them!!
"I stole 20 E's off my stingy mate Slacky. I'd gone outside to fetch them from the car when I saw the police loitering up the street, so I hid them in my pants and told him I'd thrown them away. The house got busted and I was high on free ecstasy all week."

When I open a vacuum packed beetroot I imagine the juice is blood and try to transfer the beetroot to a bowl without leaving any spatter for CSI to find and convict me.
"I follow one of the women from work on Instagram, for the last few years it's been great. Lots of pictures of her in bikinis, gym outfit and her going out scantily clad. In lockdown she bought a puppy, so now all her posts are the dog. It's shit."
"As a teenager I once got in a bad mood & kicked my parents oak cupboard door, splitting the wood. I got my 7 year old brother to throw a ball towards me and said What have you just done, pretending it had hit the cupboard. He got blamed for it and he still thinks he did it."
My side hustle is catfishing men in Facebook political groups. The Brexit ones are more gullible but the Remain ones are richer and more desperate
The TV series 'Botched' has ruined porn for me. I find myself thinking things like 'oh that poor girl has a Iatrogenic symmastia'.. knocks me right off my stride.
I was applauded for fixing a football net at my daughter's school with knots. Didn't like to admit that it was transferable skills from my extensive experience with bondage knots.
"At least once a week I hold a press conference in my car, it's generally about winning the lottery and what I'm going to do with the money. Sometimes I'm charitable other times I'm obnoxious and horrible. I always do my part out loud, I've done this for years."
"A little part of me looks forward to my husband pre deceasing me so I can replace the kitchen gear he's ruined. He's ruined non-stick pans, overheats everything, and has broken the tip of every Henkel knife."
"Everyone's making bread 'cos of lockdown. My brother is churning out loaves by the baker's dozen. Every time he comes over he proudly brings me one. Truth is, I don't like it. I nibble a slice whilst he's here then when he's gone I throw the rest to the ducks."
Instead of buying a McDonald's meal I tend to buy a burger and fries and ask for a cup of water. This cuts down on fizzy drinks but the real reason I do it is to collect the free coffee tokens on the side of the cups.
After watching the crown I talk to my dogs in the style of Prince Philip and then feel embarrassed that I sound like a massive twat in front of them.
"Once worked with a guy I loathed so much that when the time came to contribute to his farewell gift I rattled the envelope around a bit then actually took money out. Not much, only a token really, but it felt so good."
"One of the problems of working from home is I lose track of how long I've worn the same pair of trousers. I've taken to sniffing the crotch each morning, but it must be nearly a month and they smell fine. It makes me wonder why we all do so much laundry."
I once tried to demonstrate a new but buggy insurance website to Martin Clunes while wearing an animal suit that stank of cheap cologne and cat piss. I consider it a highlight of my employment to date.
"While looking at a house in a foreign country on Google street view, I decided to follow a young man on a motorbike for no reason. It was a waste of a half hour, and I've no idea why I did it."
"I let my parents use my Netflix account, we all have our own profiles. Every now and again I add a totally inappropriate film to my dad's 'my List' so my mum will find it. Sometimes I leave the film in the middle of a sex scene."
Used to share an office with someone who kept a bag of oranges on their desk. Whenever they left the room I'd juggle with them.

I often pee for over a minute but my best record for a non stop pee is two minutes and six seconds. I wish it was an Olympic sport.
I book the British Gas boiler repair service every Sunday 8am till 1pm slot and set my alarm for 6am to cancel the booking. Just a wee gift to the engineer who I like to think gets a lie in on their Sunday shift.
"If any stranger ever stops me to complain or shout at me, I speak back to them with the few words of Czech that I know. Usually utterly confounds them and they leave me alone"
"In high school I got suspended for calling a teacher a 'sweaty nonce' because he tried to keep me behind for a detention.... 8 years later, he got arrested for... you guessed it... BEING A NONCE TALK ABOUT POETIC JUSTICE"
I eat Wotsits with a fork.
"After a few beers I walked home to Hackney from the West End. Halfway I needed a grog-bog, so I spurted a massive mess on the doorstep on what turned out to be the entry to the Bank of England on Threadneedle St. It was horrendous. No regrets. Banks had just sunk the economy."
To fill a gap in my CV I've said that I was a guitarist for The Fall for a brief period. No-one has disputed this or even asked questions about it.
I always attempted to 'do the voices' when singing along to the BBC 'Perfect Day' single when it was on the radio
"Whenever I let the cat out I say, Green Cross Code, don't cross the road, keep your feet upon the grass, no fighting, watch for cars. I like to think he's listening but the reality is, he can't understand a word I'm saying."
I worked for the Dole back in the late 80s. Best part of the job was telling people the overpayment they got was down to staff error and they didn't need to pay it back.
I might have made more than a few errors just so I could tell them this.
"I've got large breasts and if I'm using my iPad in bed and lean over to get something from the bedside table, my nipples regularly like things by accident on social media."
"Every morning I have a cup of coffee and porridge warmed up in the microwave. I can't get the microwave to go ping and the kettle to switch off at the same time. When I do, I'm taking the day off."
"My boss is a dick. I used to just waste work time but when they stopped the last bit of fun we could have, I started my own game of seeing how much money I can physically cost the company. £34,000 so far since July."
When I broke up with my ex boyfriend I kept hold of his hoody because it's so comfy. Later on my new bf he asked to borrow a jumper that would fit him. I didn't tell him where it's from & it's become his favourite jumper. We always joke that he's wearing women's clothing.
"Coming into adolescence at the end of the 00s was a uniquely creatively period for a frisky teen. The oldies had their naughty mags/VHS, the youths have their phones. But no other gen will know what it's like to jack off using the web browser on a PSP."
"Our flat has been on the market a couple of months. Before viewings, my wife does such a thorough job of cleaning and tidying the place that on two occasions I've told her we have viewings when we haven't, and I simply pretend the estate agent has called to say they've cancelled."

"Started driving at 32, I'm past 40 now and still don't feel comfortable. I can't get past the fact we're all propelling metal boxes capable of death through narrow spaces past other metal death boxes coming the other way. People who start at 17 probably never think about it."
"Few times a week, early morning, I write graffiti in the dirt on bloke next-door's van. I've seen him bollock the little shits from the Geordie family across the road so many times, and I'm running out of pro Newcastle ideas."
I was briefly a lap dancer. One night it was a regular's birthday and 15 of us lined up and did the Status Quo dance for him.
"When someone asks about my dad and how he died, there's never really a gentle way to say that he was in fact, murdered. I avoid asking other people how their parents have died, for this very reason."
"Found out my ex's mum has got COVID-19 and was elated. She hated politics, refused to vote, and always believed viruses were a conspiracy. It couldn't have happened to a better person."
I tell my wife she is making it up when she smells things. It really winds her up. Truth is I've got a terrible sense of smell so just can't smell anything.
Despite loosing my job my landlord still requested the £1 I had underpaid my rent by due to a typo on bank transfer by me therefore I asked for a cheque book and have so far sent him 73p worth of cheques each one for 1p... 27 to go you tight git... #duetoatypoonbanktransferbyme
I decided I'm going to spend my wages on my much needed cosmetic surgery. People are going to say I'm being vain but unless you go about indiscriminately fucking anything that moves keep your hypocrisy to yourself thanks.
"I jumped on the vinyl bandwagon a while back, bought a expensive turntable, upgraded the cartridge etc. Spent 1000s on records. Replaced my broken CD player with a new one and realized it sounded significantly better than my turntable."
"I eat sweet corn every Sunday. I check my poo daily to see how long it takes for it to turn up. It's usually Wednesday. Makes me smile, every time."
I like to lightly scratch my arse cheeks while urinating. It's an exquisite feeling and I highly recommend trying it
"I feed my dog my nose pickings. I don't force her to eat them, she willingly laps them up."
"I had a penis enlargement op a few years ago. I wasn't exactly small I just wanted more and thought it would help with confidence. Regret it so much. Had fat injected and now I've got a lumpy freak cock. GP says it can be fixed, but it's rsiky. Biggest mistake of my life"
"When the news broke of the attack at the WTC at 9/11, I had a hangover. My boss called me to tell me that my evening shift was cancelled because of the news, and I secretly thanked the terrorists for giving me the day off. I still feel bad about it."
"My wife often suspects me of sneaking off to play golf, so I bought the exact same golf bag and shoes with some crappy old clubs to leave in the garage incase she checks. My real clubs live in the back of my van."
Was helping my dad move house a few years ago and found a suitcase full - and I mean FULL - of dildos and sex toys. Ive just pushed that memory deep into my brain and will never process it. It's fine. Dad collects or... uses dildos. That's fine. Totally fine. Gooooood.
"Im a bus driver and with safeguarding children a top priority in these dark and evil times, I've decided to not let anyone that looks like a nonce on my bus, but the problem is that I think everyone looks like a nonce, so I'm practically running around empty."

"My wife caught syphilis from a toilet seat on a work trip, so then I caught syphilis. It has really brought us together, sharing medicine, looking out for each other. I love syphilis."
"I work in the advertising industry and one of the brands I work on is Just Eat; if they give feedback that reeks of their complete lack of inspiration and zest for life, I'll order a takeaway on Uber Eats."
"EVERY time I eat a Peperami, I take off all the wrapper and inner condom, & hold it like a cigar, then pretend I'm Jimmy Saville & say now then now then now then."
When I play a World Cup on PS4 I always treat myself to a wank to a pornstar from the country I have just beaten. I always make sure Australia Japan and Germany are in the same group as me. They have the best pornstars.
"I pretend to get excited when people announce that they're in a relationship, but inside I believe that one of them is always ugly and the other one is always desperate not to be alone."
"One of my wives friends is so fit, I spend that little extra time getting ready whenever we are going out with her and her husband, hoping one day, these pornhub stories will come true"
"When the Jordan sex dvd was doing the rounds, one enthusiastic work mate was desperate for a copy and bought a dvd player especially for the viewing. "
He wasn't as amused as the rest of us to discover we'd edited the dvd to Lilo & Stitch after a minute of Jordan doing her thing.
I've been having sex with a married man for over 3 years who visits me at my home. Little does he know I've filmed a number of our sexual encounters with a small hidden camera without his knowledge. Makes me feel like I'm in the driving seat.
"I have a recording of a police siren on my phone and sometimes when driving I like to pick a car at random and tail it on the motorway, playing the siren sounds through the speakers and pretending I'm in a high speed chase."
"I can't walk past the fridge without getting a piece of ham and rolling it up like a cigar, pretending I am Winston Churchill, then eating it."
After 16 years I had the family dog put down for wetting her spot on the couch. A week later I found out it was the shower leaking in the same place!
My wife is addicted to cocaine. She knows it. I know it. It's costing us a small fortune and I can see it starting to affect our kids. I don't know how to break the cycle. Better sex though.
My wife thinks I spend too much time online now that I'm retired. I actually have a whole new career as a semi-famous writer of erotic/fetish novels that I publish under a fake name.
"I haven't seen my parents at all this year and I've decided not to visit for Xmas.Nothing to do with COVID, I just can't stand the sight of them."
"Give me the choice of sleeping with any woman in the world, I'd still choose my wife. There's better looking women out there, but she's really hot and an amazing shag..."
"I spilled so much jizz to the videos of a really hot drag queen on TikTok. Then I discovered that she's actually a woman, and I don't know what to think any more."
I was asked to provide a character ref for one of my staff in his battle for custody of his kids. I was honest and told them he was a hot head who struggled to cope in stressful situations. He lost his custody battle and is now an absolute wreck. I need to sack him but can't.

"If I'm out walking, and about to take a shortcut, if a stranger is also about to take that shortcut, I go the long route and walk faster/do short runs so when they eventually see me ahead of them they wonder if their shortcut is actually a shortcut"
I used to live with a guy who had a dog. When he was out I'd smear my toes in nutella and get the dog to lick them clean. I liked the affectionate feel of it.
"My ex was self employed and paid in cash, he hid the cash in fake food cans so he didn't have to pay his taxes. He was loaded and i was so poor and he still expected me to pay for half the rent of the fancy flat he insisted on. I regularly stole money when he made me count it."
"My husband and I are both working from home during Lockdown, he's got the spare room and I've got our bedroom. Unlike me he doesn't keep the door closed so I can hear him talking. Once a day I time a loo visit with one of his work call so everyone can hear the toilet flush."
"Me and my best mate had babies a month apart and had a joint 1st birthday party for our boys. During the photos and party, I think we got them mixed up as 5 years later my son looks nothing like me or my husband. Not sure what to do about that. I'm sure it'll be fine."
When I was a care worker I was so poor and hungry that I sometimes stole food that was meant for the residents. I'm not sure how to forgive myself.
"It's only because of coronavirus that I've realised just how big my nose is. Masks stick out so much, I look fucking ridiculous. I never noticed before."
"I work for a city council. Whenever someone is horrible and vile on a call, we take your number down and circulate it telling people you are looking for a good time."
I used to work for a cd distribution company. When I packed orders for independent record shops I gave them double the amount of cds they had ordered and for chain shops I would take the cds out of the cases of female solo singers and replace them with heavy metal bands instead.
"I am a 48 year old woman. I have an elaborate excel document on my laptop detailing my fantasy other life as a pop star - album sleeves, tracklists, tour dates, sales stats. Last year, my 14th album Vagina Agenda won the Mercury."
Everyone at work keeps mentioning my massive workload and apologising when they're sending stuff my way.I've not actually got much on at the moment and I'm concerned that there's some massive project I'm unaware of.
I got a new job that pays way more than my friends and feel really guilty about it. I'm trying to assuage my guilt by donating to random GoFundMes on Twitter.
"When my boss gets on my nerves I offer to make them a drink but don't use the kettle, I use the hot tap."
I took a picture of my bully ex-manager doing a line of coke in the boardroom on my last day. Waited a few months then anonymously sent it to the CEO one evening. He was sacked the next day. He hasn't figured out it was me as he's put me down as a character reference 3 times...
"I had an old friend from school who works in my office. I added him on Facebook and saw that his wall was full of racist, Islamophobic bile. I took screen shots and emailed them annonymously to his boss; he was sacked and had to sell his house as he couldn't pay the mortgage."
"My wife sometimes grabs my penis and makes it perform a lonely rendition of the What'll I do? theme from Birds of a Feather, squeezing it so the peehole 'sings' like a mouth."
"As a young teen, I would dry hump the giant cardboard cut out of Geri Halliwell - in the Union Jack dress - that my Spice-Girl-loving sister got from Blockbusters one Christmas. Zig-a-zig-aahhhh."

I keep subscribing my boyfriends ex wife up to random newsletters. Red squirrel society today 👍🏻
I've never put my correct phone number onto a form. Always change one digit. I've never been contacted by Telemarketers. Funny that.
"Haven't had sex for two years due to complications after surgery. That changed last night. Feel like telling the world but only speak to the guy in the newsagents these days, he probably won't care"
"I'm pretty sure my boyfriend has started to move on from our relationship, and I know I should challenge him on it, but I'm just glad to have some kind of company during the pandemic. When it's over, I won't be surprised."
Its been years since I've spoken to either of my parents and once a month I will search for their names in the local paper for death notices.
"My ex Gf's dad always and I mean always ate baked beans cold, he would just mooch about the house eating them straight out the tin and it disgusted me, this was why I broke up with her... I said it was due to not loving her anymore but no it was the DAMN BEANS!!!!"
"I visit hip-hop reviews on the Guardian and Pitchfork websites just to read boomer dads' comments. So endearing, so hilariously cliched. Especially Cardi B? Who?, Rap? Crap, more like and it's just noise, where is the real music like the Beatles or Barclay James Harvest"
"If the wife ever pops out and takes longer to return than expected I immediately assume she's died. The longer she's gone, the more detailed my imaginary plans get. She got stuck in traffic last week and I found myself browsing apartments in Buenos Aires."
"My mother in law said I was lucky to have married her son, implying he was too good for me, when she was drinking a coffee in my car. I waited until the cup reached her lips and slammed on the brakes. Glorious."
"Seen loads of people achieve things over lockdown but my daily routine during the summer, whilst furloughed, was as follows: Get up around lunchtime. Massive fry up. Get drunk, smoke a joint and sunbathe in the garden. Take a viagra and wank furiously until bedtime."
My mum was arrested for drink driving. She couldn't believe her bad luck that at 2AM she was caught on a fairly short journey. The police must have had a tip off. Sorry mum. Not sorry.
Roughly once a year I'll have a blue moon shit - the magical kind where you don't even need to wipe. I'm still hoping one day to get another blue moon sleep - the type where you wake up totally refreshed. Haven't had one for decades.
"Used to deliver to a church every month for work. If nobody was there we could collect the key and let ourselves in. When putting the delivery in the usual place found £20 on the floor. Kept it for a while to see if anything bad happened. It didn't, so it was a gift from Jesus."
"I once bought every copy of a homophobic magazine in a shop, just so I could dump them all in the nearest bin. Felt good about it at the time, but now I'm wondering if it was counterproductive in that the publishers got more money & the shop thought it sold well."
I'm a 39yr old male divorcee and met a new lovely Woman and have moved in. My mum has also taken a shine to her widowed dad and are dating and I think my teenage daughter is shagging her son. Could my life be any more fucked up?!
"I changed my moms phone auto-correct so that every time she tried to type my uncles name, it would sub in Brother Butthead. Took her months to fix it."
"Just about to hit 40, I'm and I've no idea how to adequately clean a toilet brush. Am I supposed to rinse off in the bath? Wait till it gets bad, then throw it out and replace it?"

"I work as a chef in a busy restaurant kitchen. When the dishes are ready on the pass, I often shout cervix! instead of service!. No-one's ever noticed, or if they have they've never said anything."
One of my nans would make me orange squash by pouring the water in first and then topping it up from the mixture in the bottle. It repulses me to the day.
"My ex was really into sex parties. He once took me to this members only mansion in Birmingham. Every room was like a porno. You name it, it was happening. After a few hours, I let a random girl go down on me as my ex chatted to an MP about parking charges."
I work in marketing for a TV network. Whenever we do competitions asking the public to text or phone in the answer. 90% of the time it goes to a family member or friend of somebody in the office. Sorry.

"My mum died a few years ago and although I loved her a lot, it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would"
When I've finished doing a shit and I'm wiping my arse I often recite the words of Abby Titmuss in her sex tape she's licking my arse John
"I haven't got a clue what a producer does in music, film, or TV. I can and do regularly name many famous producers and confidently declare which ones are better based on my preferences, but I haven't got the faintest idea what their job actually is."
I appeared on Pointless a few years ago. As we walked into the studio I put too much trust in a fart. I won several thousand pounds with shit in my pants.
"Unlike many people I don't just throw Snails into the next door Neigbour's gardens. I have a proper go at it and see just how far down the rd I can boot them. 8 gardens is currently the record. Don't do slugs, they just go next door."
"During lockdown I found my internet exchange up the road, it was open so just pulled all the wires out. No Zoom meetings for a week. Bliss."
To the neighbour who has blacked out his number plate because he keeps getting reported for not having car tax - it is me who keeps reporting you. That'll teach you for pinching my parking space. Police next if you keep driving it.
"I desperately wanted to shag a friend, and one drunken night she gave in and we tried to go for it. Too many pints of Dogbolter. Ruined the friendship and no sex. Rubbish."
"I can't do my bra up behind my back - I always have to fasten it round the front, then swivel it to the back and jiggle my boobs into the cups as I slip the straps on one at a time."

"I just recently realised I accidentally left the WhatsApp group for an old school friends stag-do and missed both it and the wedding, and haven't spoken to any of them since. It would have been 14 months ago"
"We won a contract to install a wireless network into an oilfield, and I was asked to do it without any experience. Googled everything, no issues for three years and won an industry award."
A friend and I one wrote a whole business plan whilst high. It was for a an authentic vegetarian black pudding. It was based around the menstruations of the female pig. We had no knowledge of a pigs cycle.
I'm a 50 something in a very professional job. Ever since I was a teenager I've peeled satsumas so the left over peel resembles a cock and balls. I'm really good at it.
"Before a dump, I always create a cushion from loo roll and place it in the pan to deaden the sound of the plops. I fear people hearing me drop my brown sausage."
My wife has a tendency to use her phone in bed until she falls asleep. I used to reboot the wifi router so she'd turn it off and give me some attention. Nowadays she just switches to cell data.
I 'check in' to every shop and pub I walk past with my phone because I want 2 weeks off work so I can play on my Xbox. I'm 50 years old.
"Until far too late in life I thought a prima donna was a pre-Madonna; I never quite worked out what it was that people did differently before Madonna came along, and was surprised by how much influence she apparently had."
"Get so bored home alone whilst wife is out at work. Yesterday I drove to Ipswich, bought a coffee and drove home again. I live in Birmingham."
Discovered husband of 20+ years has been having serial affairs throughout the marriage. Whilst I get things in order to remove him I'm quite enjoying lacing his body moisturiser with estrogen gel. Sending him off with a smashing set of moobs.
"I wrote one of the highest liked and retweeted Fesshole confessions, and the fact those numbers are mine, but I can't tell anyone about it KILLS ME"
A friend of my parents posts loads of conspiracy stuff on Facebook so I like to go and report her posts every day. She had no idea it's me and probably thinks the government are watching her. It gives me much joy.
"I'm always relieved when the speed limit changes and I can go slower. I'm terrified the whole time I'm driving. When other drivers get impatient, I think, If you could be in my shoes for 30 seconds you'd realise how well I'm doing even to be in the car."
"Note from admin: to break the confessions for a moment and ask you to help get the song Boris Johnson Is A F**king C**t to no 1 for Xmas. It's at 18 already so quite possible. Please help, 79p and the perfect way to end a quite terrible year."

"Lost my job in the summer thanks to Covid. Desperate, I started an OnlyFans account a few months back. I never show my face and now make more money a month sucking my boyfriends dick at home than I ever did slaving away in PR."
"I message celebs on Instagram in the hope that I'll fulfil a fantasy and embark on a Notting Hill style love affair. Been doing it 5 years and to date, have slept a reality tv 'star': hotel room & tiny dick, and a jockey: in their car after racing & big dick."
"Since lockdown began, Ive started using the shower nozzle to wash my arse after a dump. Like a big bidet. It's fantastic, feels great and I'm never going back to Andrex. The hoarders are welcome to continue using their gross unhygienic rags like savages. I've evolved."

I live alone and recently had a water meter fitted. I started storing my piss in the toilet bowl as long as possible without flushing. I've now become obsessed and have started joining my dog by shitting in my back garden. My water cost is now just £8 a month. I'm delighted.
I like to plug random English phrases into Google Translate and have them read aloud with the sexy French option. She's so sultry. I imagine meeting her on a nude beach and then making love in her airy apartment. Just writing this has given me a raging hard-on.
"I enjoy online amateur porn, not for the nudity, but to look at the state of some people's bedrooms. Makes me feel better that I haven't dusted in ages."
"My email address is a common surname@gmail, and I get a lot of email for other people, important things from careless solicitors, doctors etc. I mostly ignore it, but always cancel any appointments that I get reminders for"
"My life was in a mess and I had an affair. It wasn't the answer and my life became more of a mess. Love the one you are with, try to fix any issues in your life by talking to others, and don't have affairs. I will take this lesson to my grave."
"I work as a parking warden in London, I often write tickets don't bother to put them on the car. Makes the owner thing they got away with it until they get a reminder in the post"
"If I need to fart alone in bed, I often Dutch oven myself, and just enjoy my own brand for a little bit. It's never as strong as I hope for."
I suffer from depression and I'm probably still alive now because I watched some shit reality tv that made me realise my life is awesome compared to some of those vacuous cunts.
When i was 11 a lad at school told me you can turn the water bright blue in a fishtank by mixing copper sulphate crystals in the water. i pinched some from lab at school & all 5 fish died within 10 mins of mixing it in. Still makes me feel bad 35 years later.
"Waiting for my son to finish football training. Just parked at Tesco, and eaten a full pack of cheese singles, and 250g of gouda. Not disgusted with myself in the slightest."
"I let my young son believe that deer gave off a peculiar scent, when really it was me smoking weed. It was his hypothesis all along; I just didn't correct it. A sin of omission, if you will."
"We recently spent £2500 on a puppy. As well as having this debt over my head for the next two years, I'm also spending more time at work doing overtime because he's a little twat and the house has been thrown into chaos. It's less stressful at work."
Just had a verbal warning for saying a lads haircut makes him look like Princess Diana. It's shit being a teacher.
I sometimes get bored halfway through a wee so flush early and try to race to finish before the flush ends.
The most amusing / best public confessions sent to @fesshole for November. Quite an amazing crop this month (OMG at the final one). Do follow and share - plenty more coming - we love our incredible contributors. https://t.co/ZoEb4VCkDa
I'm in my 30s and still have a blankie to suck my thumb to. Same one since a kid. I never wash it in case it disintegrates. It absolutely stinks. I want it buried with me.
"I just bought 5 extra PS5's to sell at an extortionate price, because people will pay it for their children."
As a child I was declared borderline genius. I don't regret the fact that I've utterly wasted my potential. I regret not using my obvious intelligence to make easy money and have more relationships. Instead I spent my time doing complicated maths in my head and impressed no one.

BTW: Follow Fesshole's unpopular sister account @anon_opin NOW!
I say 'piss ant' instead of 'percent' in work meetings. Makes me a tiny bit happier.
"As a straight male teenager in the late 70s/early 80s Legs n Co on Top of the Pops were the highlight of my week but rather than their usual suggestive, saucy, scantily clad routines I fancied them most in the routine to the Smurf Song and dressed up as actual Smurfs"
"I'm not gay, but some months ago, watching a porn 'cumpilation', I inadvertently saw an elderly man's penis."
"And now I can't get it up any more, because I know that one day I will be elderly, and badger-bellied, and wrinkle-dicked, and it horrifies me."
I bought a lock picking training set from Amazon. I've been putting my new skills to good use by removing love locks from local bridges and flinging them in the river. 27 so far during lockdown. Doing my bit to keep Britain tidy.
"At work someone who was on the outgoing shift offered some left over filled Krispy Kremes for my team. I went to get them but there were only three left, not enough to go round. So I stood in a dark, empty office and ate them all in one go."
I finally managed to catch two cats shagging and now I don't feel like there's anything else to accomplish in life.
"My stepfather's sons cut him off and left him alone for two decades. It cut the heart right out of him. He met my mother, became part of our family and was loved again. I did not tell them that he was dying, because I wanted them to feel some of his pain when they found out."
When I'm cycling and I need to cross at a crossing I always press the button even if I can cross straight the way as there's no traffic just to stop all the lazy people in their cars.
We have a cleaner come to our house every Wednesday and she leaves the place smelling lovely and the toilets are left so fresh . In order to keep the toilet nice and fresh I urinate on the wall at the back of our house until Friday night when I start to use the toilet again.
I bought small pets for my kids when I was not thinking straight. They stink to high heaven and I wish I'd never got them. Don't do it parents. Just don't.
I actually really enjoy nibbling the cock cheese from my boyfriend's bell-end. I imagine myself as one of those 'cleaner fish' from a nature documentary and he's a grizzly old shark in need of servicing.
Marriage teaches you a lot.
"Before I got married, I didn't know you could put milk in the fridge the wrong way."
"Everyone in my family gets me novelty monopoly boards at xmas because I love them, but fair warning - if it's based on a tv show and all the squares are just episode names, straight to charity. Monopoly squares must be places, I'll die on this hill."
While I was working away last year my wife bought a man home; so pissed up that she'd forgot we have a Ring Doorbell.
"I downloaded the video file before she eventually deleted it. I'll unleash it at some point, maybe as a what happened next at our friends and family Zoom quiz."
I have an irrational jealousy of anyone who can do a good Pingu impression. Mine is shit.
"Every once in a while I'll go to the supermarket and buy a cucumber, tub of vaseline and a box of ribbed condom's. It started as a dare when I was younger but now I do it because the looks from the cashier will make your day."
"My 8month year old poo'd in the bath, my wife used my mug to retrieve it. "
When I complained she told me to grow up it's just a mug I'll be sterile when you next use it . 
I now give her the poo mug everytime I make tea or coffee.
I always thought that Michelangelo painted the ceiling of the 16th Chapel. Wondered why you never heard about the other 15 until I saw it written
I live in London and when I can I love nothing more than walking down the middle of the road instead of on the pavement. So much freedom and it feels like I'm the lone survivor of a zombie apocalypse.
"Many years ago while fixing my car I lost a crucial part from the brakes. So about 2am I got my spanners, walked down my street until I found a similar car, slid underneath and removed the part I needed."
"If you're a middle-aged woman on my Facebook friends list, there's a very good chance that I fancy your daughter."
"I'm a man who tweets as an attractive woman whose face I got off that fake face site. I only do it for anonymity, but the engagement I get from guys who would otherwise completely ignore me is creepy and weird. Ladies - I'm so sorry about all this."
When I was 14 I told my piano teacher with a straight face that my friend had died in a car accident as an excuse for not practicing that week. Later that day I found she had called my mother and asked that I change teachers.
I bought a child's birthday card from B&M for 29p so that I could cut it up for roaches
Every day when I walk my dog he pisses on my neighbours Land Rover Discovery. I could stop him but its such a ridiculous vehicle that they deserve it.
I once saw Vernon Kay in Tokyo airport. Told him the side pocket of his bag was open. Didn't even say thanks the miserable bastard.

"When I put cooked chicken in the fridge, I pretend I'm making a food safety information film."
As a child I would prank call childline from the phone box near my house crying that I was worried about nuclear power plants damaging my testicles. I lived miles away from any power plants.
"When I see a tweet that calls a linked article a must-read, I make a point of not reading it."
Somehow during the pandemic I've ended up acting as an ad hoc guidance counsellor for some schoolkids on a facebook page I admin. I never realised how many teenagers just need a confident adult to tell them that they're actually doing a great job. Tell your kids you're proud.
I voted Lib Dem in 2010. Sorry everyone.
"I often work late or when I need more time alone - I work away from home. I am not working late or rarely work away.Sometimes I'm in a nice hotel, just a couple of miles away eating a nice dinner in peace.I love my wife and kids but sometimes can't be arsed with them."

"I was an early adopter of Facebook. I invited & persuaded lots of friends and family to join. I'm thoroughly ashamed of this fact. I've deleted my account now. It feels like I invited them to a cult, fucked off and locked the door behind me. 😕"
"My partner likes to watch romantic/sad movies with me. I don't pay attention at all, but think about stuff and have a cry. She thinks I'm crying at things happening in her choice of film. Fuck that - plenty in life to cry about."

I cheated at Junior Monopoly with my 5 year old son..... and still lost.
"I've never bought shampoo or conditioner in any house where I've lived. I just use other people's, whatever they have there."
The best part about working from home and the wife being out is that I can eat chocolate digestives covered in clover butter and no one can judge me.

I used to share a house with a lass from Hull. One day I discovered she'd been helping herself to my Nutella. I knew she was scooping out the chocolatey goodness with her hands because I could see finger shapes in the bottom. I did the rightful thing and pissed in her vinegar.

"I once squeezed a spot on the top of my earlobe and it had the perfect arc of pus, I think about it often and no spot has ever come close to that satisfying pop"

"I can never remember which toothbrush is mine, so I just pick them at random. It's gone too far to ask who's is who's."
"My wife and I just had an absolute banger of a shag. This isn't a confession as such, I just wanted to tell someone."
"Years ago I found a hundred dollars in a ziplock bag stuffed between seats on the train, so of course I took it. To this day I worry over the possibility I ruined some poor bastard's drug deal and he's going to find me some day."

My partner appeared on a well-known makeover show. I feel that the image and personality change that came from that has made them a less attractive person. I wish I'd stopped them from doing it.
"I make cups of tea without using fresh water each time, just whatever is in the kettle. My record is using water still in the kettle after returning from a 3 week holiday. Tasted absolutely fine."

As a treat once a week I will have a spoonful of butter from the tub and eat it like it was ice cream.
Bet £4K on Trump to win. Spent last 12months saying I'd be happy to lose it if it means he leaves White House. I'm not laughing now though am I? FFS.
"I was a painter and decorator back in the 80s and one day I was up a ladder painting the outside windows on a farm and I looked over into a pig stye and the farm hand was shagging a pig, I feel guilty for not telling the farmer but the pig looked like it was enjoying it."
Was knocking one off on the settee when I noticed I was sharing the settee with my son's Woody from Toy Story toy. Then I thought about how Toy Story toys are alive and just lie really still. Horrified.
"I work marketting for a large movie distribution company, I guarantee you that a good 90% of all positive customer/viewer reviews are typed up by our people. We do it to create a fake hype around a release."
When tidying my son's bedroom I found a library book so returned it for him & was told at counter it was past it's return date and I had to pay a fine. I panicked and said my son died & I found it when clearing out his cupboards. There was a pause and she said she'd let me off.

In 2013 in the depths of depression I was mere seconds away from throwing myself off a bridge. GTA5 was out that week and wanted to see if it was any good so put it off. Was alright I guess.
I was once given a brace of pheasants by a friend; couldn't bring myself or find a willing butcher to pluck and dress them so shoved them in a bin outside Urban Outfitters in the Manchester Arndale.
"Sometimes, when I'm cleaning out the cat litter, I pretend I'm an archaeologist excavating a dig"

I let out a little scream every time I see the World Trade Centre Towers in old TV shows and movies.
My boss was a lazy SOAB! so when it came to my annual appraisal he sent me the usual MSWord form that we both fill in. There are sections for me to fill and sections for his contribution. I filled in my bit and also filled in his bit...Putting me forward for promotion. It worked.
"We told the RSPCA we had to return our adopted cat because of allergies, but really it was because it was a little bastard that constantly attacked us."
I always deliberately wait a good 3 to 4 seconds after the lights change to green just to antagonise the stupid cunt behind me.
I'm actually very good at judging how much pasta I need. I just pretend I'm not to my wife as I'm a fat bastard who wants to eat more pasta.
"Bought a new house, friends noticed we had a lock in the bedroom. Got praised by mates that my wife and I are still shagging machines after 3 kids. Truth is I mainly use the lock to eat crisps so I don't have to share with the 2 year old!"
"William Hill have a promotion called Scratch Of The Day. Whenever I see it on the website, I scratch my arse and say No, that's the scratch of the day and chuckle to myself."
"Mum, I didn't get fired from my part-time job at the bakers for being gay. It was because I kept eating the raw cake batter and drawing cat faces on the gingerbreads."
"The fridge freezer's died. All the food's going off, and we can't get a new one delivered for 48 hrs. Just one of those things, I told my wife. But it isn't. It's because I tried to clear a lump of ice at the back by hitting it with a hammer, and it all just stopped."
My bf likes me to tell him he's the biggest I ever had but in reality he's hung like a hamster. He often asks am I hurting you? but it's really more of an irritation than anything. I have a huge collection of compensatory dildos though so we're good.
"When we met, my ex gave awful blowjobs. Absolutely fuming that all the great techniques I taught her will now be used on another man. Where's the justice?"
My kids are artisan sourdough snobs and it's all my own fault.
"Years ago, I set my mates house up online as a brazilian restaurant cos he confessed that his girlfriend had a Brazilian wax done. He still got random calls to book a table 10 years later though his girlfriend long since binned him and took her waxed minge elsewhere."
When I was a little kid and had to share a bath with my brother I always got the end with the taps sticking into my back. When I got older and had the bath to myself it was quite a few years before I realised it was more comfortable to sit at the other end.
I'm 41 and I still don't know what part of a spring onion you eat. When I help my partner cook I just hedge my bets and go for the middle.
"I'm 42 and I can't associate most month names and their numbers. 5th month? Let me count them. What number is July? No idea without counting my fingers. I can remember Jan, Feb, Mar, Nov, Dec."
Sometimes when my wife and kids are out I stick bass line music on and snort the contents of the baking cabinet just to try and re-live my glory days.

"I like to heat my tampons on the radiator before inserting them. Feels like an internal, warm hug."
"I like to imagine that the cutlery wants to be chosen and each fork is saying pick me, pick me when I open I drawer."
I regularly Febreeze clothes rather than go through the hassle of washing them.
"Every single one of my direct parental descendants, right back to some amoeba in the primordial soup, managed to successfully reproduce before dying. The fact I might be the one who breaks that combo is fascinating, and utterly terrifying."
"Been with my wife for nearly 20 years, and the other day she wanked me off while sticking a finger up my bum. Who says sex with the same person can't still be fun."
I'm a conveyancing solicitor. Clients get really pissy about coming in to sign documents all the time so I forge their signatures. Everyone does it.
I don't think there's a father alive who hasn't wanted to punch fuck out of their teenage son at some point. They go from cute loving kids to moody arrogant cunts as soon as the hormones kick in
I don't like the new twenty pound notes purely because they don't roll up into nice coke straws like the old ones.
When I go the pub I always tell myself I'm only going to have one beer. I always have 8 to 10 beers
"My first ever sexual experience was being rimmed by a girl called Anna in my room at my girls only boarding school while playing 'I Have Never'. Two other girls watched. I'm straight and haven't had a lesbian experience or been rimmed since, but I masturbate over it all the time."
I break spaghetti in half before putting it in the saucepan. Why bother waiting around to slowly bend it over as the water softens it?
Every Sunday I consume about a third of the gravy via frequent trips to the kitchen before my family even get a chance to see it.
"My landlord is such a lovely, sweet family guy. I often fantasise about not paying rent and paying my way with sex."
"I just had an ad pop up on Facebook from JD Williams. It's great, they now use 'plus size' women in underwear ads. This one was gorgeous! I went and had a secret wank within minutes. First time I've wanked to an underwear ad since I was about 15. I'm 57. It was fucking awesome."
"I'm 41 years old, but whenever I turn the lights off and i walk through the corridor in the dark I still think the monsters will get me."
"When I was a young teenager, a mate told me that if I shagged a cored out orange, I would cum bucketloads. Tried it. It was rubbish. Sticky orange pith was wedged in my pubes for days."
"WFH since Spring. I have a trick where I unplug the phone when a call comes through, then click answer on my screen. The call records but its silence both ends until the caller gives up. No-one has noticed, if they do I'll just play dumb and say it must be faulty equipment."

"Am thinking about getting pregnant on purpose by my married lover, I calculate it would generate an income for me of about £740pm which would cover my mortgage"

I went on Rolf's Cartoon Club and enjoyed it. I just drew cartoons and drank juice
"I used to get angry about how much mess my wife and kids made in the house. A few years ago I lost all three of them in a car accident and now I'd give anything to have that back. Learn a lesson from me and love what you have, no matter what it is."
I tell every girlfriend I've had that I've never cum from a blowjob. They all try really hard to be the first and then feel a sense of accomplishment when they succeed.
"When I'm having a productive day at work and ticking off lots of things on my to-do list, I pretend I'm a robot called the Achievatron 500."
I purposely drop the camera to show off my cleavage when I'm on a video call with the team fittie.
"Most days at work I eat an entire rotisserie chicken in my car. I can't imagine it's that healthy, but the chickens are too irresistible."
"In the 80s, when catalogue shopping was all the rage, I used to order both the budget & premium models of the same product. Eg, a Commodore Vic20 & C64. I'd return the budget model in the premium's box and then buy the cheaper one."
"I just had 12 Ferrero Rocher for lunch, they were supposed to be for my mums birthday."
My wife gets angry at me for looking at my phone when we are out with the kids. So now I turn the phone around 90 degrees and pretend I'm videoing my daughter when I'm watching Soccer Saturday. Top tip!
My hair's got quite long during lockdown so every now and then I put it up in a manbun and look at myself in the mirror. Then I realise I look like a cunt and vow never to do it again.
I sneak out late at night and put my overflow rubbish in my elderly neighbours bins. It's like extremely middle-class flytipping.
"When I was 16 at work I waited a table with Bruce Forsyth and his wife. As he left he signed an autograph for me, and I said My mum won't believe I've met Bob Monkhouse! His wife thought it was funny, he did not."

Drinking 1/2 bottle whisky a night for last 6 months at home. To prevent my wife from knowing when bottle is empty ill add soy sauce and water - looks indenticle - until I replace and repeat. Bottle is always half full & I'm always half cut.

I got a family member Cannon & Ball tickets for Christmas last year. I was sad Bobby Ball had died until I got an email today telling me I was due a full refund. Merry Christmas to me.
My wife has been asked to work from home since March. I haven't watched porn with sound for over 6 months now.
"I work for the Royal Mail at a large sorting office, the more you stick FRAGILE all over your parcel the harder it gets thrown at the conveyor belt. I take pride in hearing the items clunk and smash the rubber and steel belt"
"I have had twp vasectomies. The first one didn't work, my sperm were still motile. I am unreasonably proud that my 'boys' beat the system. Good work fellas."
"Our washing machine broke down last year. My wife picked out a new one, but I overruled her. I bought one that wasn't as good & cost more. Only because her choice was manufactured by a brand which was the 1980s/90s shirt sponsor of a football club I utterly despise."
"I just had a 20 minute conversation with my dog asking him what he wanted Santa Paws to bring him for Christmas, I'm single"
My dog loves licking my ears so I've stopped cleaning them in the shower so he can get lots of juicy ear butter as a treat
"Before lockdown, I always went to the local after finishing work early for a few pints and got to know a few regulars. I was dreading Christmas Day in the pub with the wife & family and everyone letting on. Guess I've dodged that for another year."
Ive been running a 5k three times a week since lockdown started in the spring and I can honestly say I don't feel that much better for it. Yeh its nice to get some fresh air but Ive noticed very little change in terms of my physical fitness.
"When I was 8, I once pissed in the garden flowerbed. My 8 year old brain told me that it would be a good idea to dig up where I had pissed, so I did."
I unearthed a small toby jug and took it in to show my mum. 
She loved it and it stayed on display in the lounge for years.
I'm a chartered surveyor and lucky to be well paid and have a relatively secure job. I fucking hate it and have no passion for my work. I wanted to study film but was talked into it by my dad who walked out of my life not long after. I regret it every day I wake up.
"I always google streetview the addresses of people buying our old crap off eBay, and I do it in an entirely judgemental way."
"I never understood why people think the David Cameron pigs' head thing is unlikely. Surely we've all been on nights where if there was a pigs' head to hand, we'd have fucked it?"
"Part of me would quite like to get corona, a low impact case obviously, but enough that I can justifiably go on the sick for a few weeks as work is a fucking nightmare and I need to get away from it"

I've put on so much weight during lockdown that I can hold the handle of a saucepan in my bellybutton while I stir whatever I'm cooking with one hand and text with the other. Which I'm doing now.
"To bide the time while waiting for the bus, I had a cigarette. When I was done, I stubbed it out and threw it in the bin. Afterwards I popped into the shop to buy a can of coke, and came out to find the bin engulfed in flames and melting. Sorry Haringey Council - it was me."
We had a re-org at work and I made three people redundant because they voted for Brexit. It didn't change the result but it made me feel a lot better. Brexit turned out to be bad news for those fuckers and their families.
When I charge my phone on the train I imagine that somehow more charge is going in when the engines rev or we are going fast. Sort of like a bike light dynamo from the 70's. I appreciate how ridiculous this sounds.
"I'm worried my partner will check my browsing history. The kinky porn sites aren't the problem - it's the Estate Agent searches. I've been looking to leave them for about 4 years, but haven't progressed beyond looking."
"I stupidly told my classmates my dad's first name and one day when he picked me up from school, everyone started screaming his name. This led to him chasing them around the school cark park with an open umbrella for 10 minutes. Thereafter, I was known as The Umbrella Bandit."
"I still fear the day my mother decides to clear out the storage cupboard in the eaves, as I know I've left a stash of porn mags in there. They've been there 10 years - I just can't think of a plan to retrieve and dispose of them."
Whenever I find snails in the garden I always chuck them over the fence. My neighbour is always saying 'lot of bloody snails this year'. I nod and share his annoyance. Serves him right for parking on the shared driveway.
Whenever I went on a night out my main goal was steal the nicest coat I could find. Meant I always went home warm and dry. Then I put them on eBay. Made about £2k.
After a heavy night out I decided to set fire to a wheelie bin. The next morning the building next to it had burned down. I still fear a knock on the door 15 years later.
"I earn £80k a year and my boss never checks in with me so I spend every afternoon watching Netflix, completing DIY tasks and generally fiddling about. I think he does the same."
"If I have to go out to get something out of the boot of my car at night, I glance down the road over the top of it as it opens like I'm Mr Blonde about to pull out a tied up policeman."
My wife keeps telling me to enjoy and cherish the time with our 4yr old because it won't be long till she grows up. Well good. I can't stand the little shit. Roll on the day I can just meet her down the pub for a pint and she can fuck off back to her own house afterwards.
Hope COVID-19 continues into summer 2021 so I don't have to go to a wedding. Don't want to buy a gift or socialise with any of the tossers.
"If I get piss on the rim, I'll just lift my foot and wipe it with my sock rather than waste good bog roll."
"I'm a head chef and own 5 restaurants in my area, the truth is I hate cooking and the hours are shit... I'd say the pay is good but it's not even that amazing, I do it because it's all I know and I'm due to retire in 3 years- for anyone reading... DONT BE A CHEF ITS SHIT"

"Whenever I visit family or friends, I pinch their TV remotes. I have over 40 in my garage."
I have watched so much hardcore porn that I can no longer use Head & Shoulders Citrus Fresh. Its colour and texture remind me too much of slightly shit-tinged lubricant oozing around a distended anus.
Husband makes me go and buy fancy £5 bread from the farmers market. I get a similar looking one from Tesco for £1.40 and everybody coos about how much better it is than normal bread.
"I click on competitors' ads on Google every day, just to knock 75c off their profits. It gives me a warm feeling of achievement."
In my office drawer I have a document that could potentially bring down the CEO of a major entertainment company. However I haven't been there since March and I'm worried I'll get made redundant and can't go and rescue it.
I know the wifi password for the homeless shelter next door. Haven't paid for broadband for 4.5yrs.
I once tried wanking on a web cam for strangers I met in an online chat room. The fourth person to appear was someone I used to work with. We both gasped and hung up.

"As kids, we use to go to the building sites, go into the houses and climb up to the rafters and take a shit, for no particular reason other than see how far it would splat"
I went down on this guy to give him a blow job. I forgot I had chewing gum in my mouth. It fell out and so I discreetly buried it in his pubes. No regrets.
"About 15 years ago we knocked the head off a statue of Joseph Priestley in Leeds with a sledgehammer, put in a bin bag and kept it in a friends garden for exactly a year then returned it, kept the nose though."
"During the first lockdown my wife started painting. First was rocks, then canvases. She then moved on to paint parts of the house. I pretend to like it but it's shit. It's all shit. I can't wait to leave her when our child is grown up."
"On my best mates WhatsApp group there is one miserable fucker who every time he opens says anything I give serious consideration to leaving the group. At this point, I fucking hate him and his sad little life."
I still clean my ears with cotton buds despite the warnings on the pack. I am almost deaf in one ear and too embarrassed to see my gp as they might know my secret 🙈.
"Whenever I see people protesting anti-lockdowns a part of me cheers for them, cos I know I'll get to spend more time at home playing games all day and get paid for it on furlough"
"Whenever l watch TV with my wife she insists on the volume being on an even number, but as soon as she's not looking put it on an odd one. Gone on for years."

"Letting an employee down gently when someone else got the promotion they wanted this week, I said, You don't want to be the guy. You want to be the guy the guy counts on. It's true, but I totally got that line from The West Wing."
"I have a company car, when I get bored of it and want a new one, I just drive into a wall and blame a stray fox distracted me so I had to swerve"
"I work for a UK landlord-tenant deposit scheme. Dodgy decisions & favours to estate agents, huge backlogs, non-existent customer service, staff incompetence, personal data loss, drug abuse, internal fraud - all commonplace. Genuinely astonished the press haven't found out"
"I have a fake Twitter and Facebook account as I need to keep tabs on my partners ex girlfriend. As I have blocked her on my own account. She is desperate and tries to be at all the events we are. So if I know she is going, we both chose not to go. Get over it."
"I volunteer in a charity bookshop. Any donated books on astrology, homeopathy or other new age bollocks go straight in the recycling. Along with most self-help and business advice books. And Dan Brown."
We live on a busy main road and our dog sits and stares out of the window. People always walk past and look at him. I like to sit with him and wave his paw at people. My husband goes mad but I think it's super cute. Old men love it.
When I trim my pubes I put the clippings in a neat little pile on my front lawn so the nesting birds can use them. Giving a bit back to nature.
I'm a literary agent. Manuscripts with the page numbers in a different font from the text are placed in the bin unread. Manuscripts with double spaces after full stops are thrown in the bin unread.
"Was always curious about trying a bit of cock. After finally plucking up the courage, I took the plunge. Turns out I don't like the smells of balls and have a terrible gag reflex. Not for me. The chap was very understanding."
My ex boyfriend used to cut his corns in the bath and leave them for me to get rid of. I got so fed up that I started collecting them and would put them in his chicken curry once a week. The very thought of it still makes me feel good!
"Sometimes if I'm not in a rush in a supermarket, I'll place a random item into someone else's trolley when they're not looking just to see how they react when they spot it. It feels like I'm being naughty, but it's a nice feeling."
"I used to do porn. It was fun for a while but got boring doing the same pull out and cum on tits routine every day. Most 'pornstars' are crap at sex, the fun comes from flirting while naked with any female production crew members who are on set."
"Inspired by more than a few Fesshole confessions I tried my first slice of raw bacon tonight. And my second, and third. It was lovely, yum!"
"I have worked in politics for 38 years and not once in that time have I met a politician as bad as the current bunch we have in the UK, I have met liars and money grabbers from all parties but none to the extent of the ones we have now, I genuinely despair for my children"
"I have been a plumber for 8 years, I trained purely because it looked easy, I needed a trade and porn made me think I'd get laid daily.... it's not easy, it's boring and I haven't had sex with a customer in that time once"
I have given all of my employees an iPhone and use the tracking app to see where they are - my office manager says this is wrong but I know who the liers and shirkers are
When my wife asks me to go to supermarket I always pop two bars of her fav chocolate in the basket. If she kicks off because I forgot something I keep both and eat them in my shed. She still hasn't worked out the correlation to being nice and more chocolate.

"I'm a 28 year old male and I regularly use hair removal cream on my arse crack. Its so liberating, my butt feels like a fresh dolphin."
While working from home I play with my willy all day like some sort of lewd corporate stress toy. I'm really worried that when I return to the office I'm going to inadvertently continue.
Once sat watching our hamster cage for twelve hours because we thought the female hamster was giving birth. It turns out HIS balls were dropping. Twelve hours of my life watching balls drop.
I always using catch-up on things like Comic Relief or Children In Need so I can fast forward through anything I find upsetting or dull.

I love my wife. Really do. She saved my life by helping me beat depression and I owe her everything I have but if she keeps loading the dishwasher wrong it could lead to divorce.
"My wife is only interested in sex if it's slow, seductive and sensual - It's not practical though and the result is that we only ever have sex about once a month and it's the same every time. I wank more now in my 30s than I did when I was a teenager."
I have now reached an age where a good poo is more satisfying than a shag. This pleases me as I'm guaranteed at least one moment of pleasure a day.

I make loud motorbike noises when I ride my mountain bike along cycle paths.
I'm 50 and a dentist.
I always respond to lunch invitations from my boss and certain others in the organisation by saying I've already made plans. And that's not a lie. The plan is simply not to have lunch with them.

"Often, before driving off, I give my imaginary passengers a little talk about estimated journey times and destination weather forecasts like I'm piloting a big plane."
"To make Pornhub more interesting I close my eyes, flick down fast and must get off to whatever I land on. Discovered JOI - jerk off instruction - and it has revolutionized the way I wank. Also it now takes 10 times as long."
"I've been looking after my sick parents. Last night I banged a load of their morphine capsules, washed down with a bottle of wine. It was great. This morning I threw up like a teenager. Not sorry."

Whenever I need some time away from my missus I tell her I'm off to turn over the compost bin.We haven't had one for years but behind the shed I have a chair and umbrella where I can smoke a joint in peace. I do have a couple of bags of compost should she ever ask for some.
When we go for a family walk in the park and take a football for the youngest to kick round we normally take a bag for life to put the ball in when it's dirty. We call it the dirty ballbag. So far the kids haven't cottoned onto it but it's only a matter of time.
Got a drunken late night handjob from a colleague who had slipped over earlier in the evening. She arrived at work the following day with her arm in a cast. Turns out she'd done the deed with a broken wrist.

Whenever my missus is not looking after dinner I always like to lick the plate. Whenever she catches me I tell her that in some countries this is a sign that you've enjoyed the food. She tells me to go live there then.
"As a teenager of the late 80's we didn't have internet porn, so we had to make do with the underwear section in mail-order catalogues. The faint outline of a pubic triangle was as good as it got, and I had those page numbers memorised."
I detest my in-laws so much I always bank up odd jobs and conveniently do them all when they come to visit so I don't have to spend with them.
One of the first sex scenes I owned on tape happened to be in Schindler's List and I wanked myself dry to it. Always fast-forwarded through all the Nazi stuff but still feel a bit guilty about it.

When measuring my knob as an adolescent I mixed up cm and inches and oh so briefly believed I had a massive cock

When I eat crisps I always munch them to the tune of the cheeky girls. No other food. No other songs. Just this.

My main achievement since retiring has been to work out how to buy Bitcoin and use it to buy weed over the internet.

"After 33 years of marriage I've realised I'm so unhappy. I fantasise about having a drink with a woman I work with, then going home to her house and cuddling while watching TV. I don't want sex, just affection and love. I crave another person's touch."
My wife thinks our mortgage ends next year. But it's really another 5 years because I extended it 15 years ago when I was broke and depressed. Now she thinks she can retire and we'll be financially sound. My depression is rooted in my deceit. I wake up in cold sweats worrying.

I'm colourblind. So when I go to the bottle bank I haven't a clue if I'm throwing the correct coloured bottles into the green or brown banks. It's a lottery.
"I have a page on Instagram that showcases my sexy legs while wearing stilettos, have loads of sad horny guys following me - what they don't realise is that I'm a guy too."

I like to think someone is going to be thrilled when they find a signed Danielle Steele that says yours in love or To Cressida - may you find what you seek.
Please regularly wash your outer ears and behind them with actual soap. Letting shampoo suds flow over them isn't sufficient. I'm a hairdresser and middle aged women who think their shit doesn't stink are the worst for this.

My boyfriend finished with me after being together two years and one of the last things he said to me was 'you've put too much weight on'. I shagged his married dad two weeks later.

My wife thinks that I don't like going down the pub with my mates because I've had a falling out. It's actually because I like spending time with her.
When shopping if the person before me fails to put down a checkout divider I dispense instant summary justice by damaging their food when they are not looking. Recent examples are sticking my finger through their bread and bruising apples. Now my wife has started doing it too.
"I reported every Facebook sponsored ad I saw as 'child nudity' for three months, each requiring time and resources to investigate. Haven't seen an advert for 18 months now."
"My husband is food phobic and despite being in his late 50s has never even tried banana, apple or anchovy. Or so he claims. I regularly make him banana pancakes. God knows what he thinks they are. Apples and anchovies are much easier to hide."

In my early 20s I used to hit the local clubs on a Friday & Saturday night. I was in decent shape but would sweat ferociously. To get around this and improve my chances with the ladies I would put a sanitary towel under each armpit under my shirt. Worked a treat.
I sexted with a Z list celebrity on Instagram early into lockdown. It was fantastic. We still talk every other week but now it's all about what her kids are having for tea and how gutted she is that Celebrity Come Dine With Me never got back to her.
"Last year I fucked someone who's Twitter-famous. He told me his marriage was failing and he was desperately unhappy. I completely fell for it, like an idiot. Now, I occasionally daydream about seducing his wife and then convincing her to leave him. She deserves better."
I've told my team at work that I haven't replied to emails over the last couple of days as I've been really busy. I've actually been binge watching all the Bourne movies. Love working from home.

"When I have cause to transfer money to my mates, I put down things like 'anus smell' and 'genital warts' as references so they appear on their bank statements. I'm 40, and an academic in a Russell Group university."
A previous user hadn't log out of her Facebook on a public library PC so I messaged some of her male friends saying I'd always lusted after them and that we should shag and some agreed.

A job I had used to give you a £10 voucher every time you got a positive review from a customer. Every month I made a fake email account and filled in fake reviews of myself. Paid for my girlfriends Christmas presents every year
"From 1988-1995 I used to charge money to sit peoples driving tests for them, I think I sat it at least 100 times but Examiners were starting to recognise me by the end so I had to give up. If they queried it I used to say I came from a huge family and we all looked alike."
Weirdest place I ever had a wank was in the childhood home of Margaret Thatcher.
"As a mature student at uni, I had to self-fund. With a good camera & a darkroom at home, I dabbled in amateur porn pics to generate some cash. Now retired, I spend evenings surfing the web to find copies of my work on porn sites. Its amazing how much of it is still out there."
I often find myself secretly resenting my wife and two young children for decreasing my odds in surviving an upcoming apocalyptic event.
I have my own YouTube channel & all it consists of is me popping my own spots. I've have over 100k views so far but I haven't told anyone close to me.
I badly burnt my lips because I kissed a grill while singing I kissed a grill and I liked it in front of some people but the grill was still hot.
I work at a takeaway and whenever I serve a fat customer I say I'm sorry about your weight as I hand them their order. They usually cheerfully reply that they haven't been there long.
Getting worried that I'll look back on the first few weeks of lockdown as some of the happiest of my life. I hope it didn't peak there.
"I hate my cat. I've never hated a cat before but this one is a right twat. I pretend to everyone that he's great, but he's not. I don't have a clue how I would explain to my kid that I've given him away and I can't cope with lying about him dying, so I'm stuck with him."

My wife thinks I'm having an affair because I'm secretive on my phone but I'm actually just running a successful porn account on Twitter and don't want her to find out.
I come to fucking hate dogs lately. Every cunt has got a dog these days and no one has them trained. 
But when I go to price a job I make a huge fuss of the stupid animals as I'm far more likely to get the job then. I'll add money on if they use the phrase fur babies

I'm a lesbian. But I just can't bare to watch lesbian porn. The girls with long finger nails and the dreadful story lines have never turned me on. I much prefer gay porn - gets me off in about 2 minutes.
"Getting married was the stupidest thing I have ever done, I'm only sticking around coz of the dog."
"Used to work at a major cinema chain on the food stand, sometimes I'd shout 'who's Jeff please?' Instead of 'who's next please'. Still feel bad about it, I mean some of them were women!!!"

Due to playing computer games as a child. I get a sense of achievement when my area moves up to the next covid level while laughing at those stuck at level 1.
"After a sweet routine of stories, cuddles and song, we close our kids' bedroom doors & say goodnight. Lastly they call sweetly to each other across the landing: Heil Hitler says our 9yr old boy. Hail Satan his 11yr old sister replies lovingly. Cracks me up every single time."
After years of alcoholism I've quit drinking. I'm terrified to find out what a tedious bastard sober me really is.
I manage an Under 8's football team. A new lad came training and I found out he was a liverpool fan. I strung him along for a few weeks with the promise of signing on and then told he wasn't good enough.
I block every account that I see a promoted tweet from on twitter. I just blocked the NHS organ donation account and now I feel like a tory
"I love squeezing spots that appear on my face. Especially the ones that contain a surprisingly large amount of pus and, when burst, leave a little mark on the mirror."
"When i wake up in the middle of the night i instantly guess the time. If i am within 10 minutes i give myself one point. If i guess the exact time i get 3 points. If i guess correctly and it's a pleasing number, like 3.45 or 2.22 i get 5 points."
I end all my relationships by ghosting as its most effective way to get out. No pretend let's stay friends nonsense. Just I don't want to ever see or hear from you again. My mate says I need to grow some balls. Thing is I have amazing balls. I was just born without a spine
I drunkenly pissed all over my girlfriends expensive designer heels and blamed the dogs
"If a stranger disagrees with me on Facebook, I report their profile for harassment and block them."
On my nighty walks I always come across a smell that reminds me of an ex-boyfriend. I start feeling wistful then I turn to see that I'm walking past wheelie bins.
The pube in the butter was mine. I was spreading Lurpak on my toast whilst on the toilet taking a leak. I must have misplaced the toast during a difficult manoeuvre.
"Once while waiting in the line at the local Aldi I saw a woman who had a giant mole hidden under her hairline, pretty sure it was cancer by the way it looked, still regret not telling her."
Someone I know started a dog grooming business and whenever they post before and after pics the dog looked way better and happier before.
"A mate has set up a standing order wrong to my bank account, instead of paying £10 a month for the football competition I'm running, he has set up weekly payments; haven't told him. I'm putting it all in a savings account & will give him it back at the end of the season.. maybe"

"I love my children but regret having them. Between dealing with school bullies and parent politics, it has made me realise that mankind doesn't need any further generations. We are just scum. The sooner we're wiped out the better."
Once cycled alongside Boris Johnson for a stretch along the Thames towards Parliament. Simply said hello to him. Regret that I didn't push him into oncoming traffic. Sorry everyone.
I like wank against the clock to questions on master mind. If I'm not anywhere completion I continue anyway with the I've started so I'll finish mindset.
"I was responsible for the hashtag #SusanAlbumParty put it in the mix as a joke thinking it'd get spotted, I'd claim ignorance and we'd use a sensible one."
What marriage has taught me. No matter how good things seem and how good the sex is - as soon as you stop kissing. It's over. For the love of god end it then. I'm still deeply unhappily married 15 years after this realisation. It's too late now and we have a teenage child
Me and the Mrs are trying for a baby. I don't want one. Before we shag I have a secret wank to try and use up my supplies!

I buy bottles of good gin and little tins of delicious flavoured tonic. One always runs out first and I have to buy more to avoid being in an endless cycle of ginless tonic or tonic-less gin. I am probably an alcoholic.
"I work for a large global charity. What the charity actually does is great, but it's such a small part of the brand. It's also the best payed job I've ever had. When you donate from your community fundraiser, that money usually goes on office supplies or biscuits for the team."
"Though I am fed up to the back teeth with COVID lockdown, I hope the measures stay in place until Christmas so that I don't have to visit my awful in-laws."
If my husband doesn't stop buying cheap loo roll I may divorce him. My arse feels like I've been eating nothing but vindaloo for weeks. I don't even like curry

"My wife indicates she wants intercourse by erotically humming the theme from Bergerac directly into my earhole. She calls it Bergeracking & because I can't stand people with claggy mouths, she sometimes does a version with added lip smacks which she calls 'Berger-clacking.'"
Whenever I need to move sideways in the kitchen I do a ballet dancer type side kick thing. My wife has seen me do it once and said what the fuck was that? I now only do it by myself.

"Whenever anyone emails and says they're reaching out to me, I hyperlink their text to a video of the Four Tops in my reply. No one has ever commented. I hate working in marketing."
As a teen my mates uncle was a die hard communist who lived near a nuclear power station. Several times when drunk we'd phone him at night and say cryptic things like the dove flies at 3am hoping he'd go and blow it up

"I used to always listen to 'Gett Off' by Prince on repeat before going on a date, and 'Dressed for Success' by Roxette whilst getting ready for job interviews."
I was all set to do a Reggie Perrin in March and leave the wife and kids. They don't notice me anymore so I've got a narrow boat and I'm going to canal around the UK on my own. Covid has delayed me but I'm counting down the days until I sail free.
"I'm doing Test & Trace from home for Serco. I didn't bother learning what to do, and I haven't spoken to anyone in 5 months. I've been paid £1350 a month for turning a computer on, and turning it off a bit later. Nobody appears to give a fuck."
"I always let my cat lick the earwax I pick out of my ears off my fingers, as a treat. She seems to love it, and gets visibly excited whenever I itch my ears."
"I went on a date with a woman who had a Hull accent. I'm sorry, but it's completely unlovable and I had to break it off. If you are from Hull good luck to you, it's a hindrance!"
"A part-time job I had at uni paid me an additional £5 a month in expenses for food/coffee. 10 years later, I still receive £5 a month in my bank account from said job. That's £600 so far. It's gone on too long now for me to tell them."
"When I was about 10/11 years old I made a massive bogey ball. My mum found it and threw it away, but I think about it often."
"Mum's fiancé reacted to me coming out by saying you can't bring some puff to the wedding. Well the joke's on you, Chris, because it's your son I've been seeing for the last 6 months."
"Marianne, it was me who shat in your guitar on the school trip to Snowdonia. We had a theory that the strings would slice it up on the way through. Problem is, you can't slice diarrhea."
"During zoom meetings, me and a work colleague cut little hats out of paper and photograph them on peoples heads. We then share them on WhatsApp."
"My biggest regret is the time I took a shit-ton of MDMA at Glasto, ended up hooking up with two girls, attempted a threesome in their tent but I couldn't get it up no matter what. Just sat and watched them and giggled and cried all at the same time"
I found a car salesman on Reddit boasting about shafting a customer. So I reported it to the dealership & the car company. Included another of his posts with identifying tattoos & lots of illegal drugs. Not sorry in the slightest. Hope he lost his job.
"On my 40th birthday, I discovered I was no longer capable of going for a piss without a tiny drop leaking shortly afterwards. No health problems prior. Can't belive old age begins with a leaky cock. Depressing to think my body is basically slowly getting worse from now on"

Whenever I write the car name Citroen I have to double the check the spelling. I work for Citroen.
"Whenever I run out of deodorant, I just spray myself with the bathroom air freshener"
I use Facebook birthday notifications as prompts to unfriend people. If I don't care enough to wish them Happy Birthday then they don't need to know what I'm up to. Plus there's a perverse pleasure in cutting them out on what should be a day of celebration.
"Whenever someone I know on Facebook posts announcing their nan dying, I take a good look at the picture and try to work out if she would have been fit when she was younger"

In 1999 my lodger committed suicide in his bedroom. I sold my house 6 months after. The woman who viewed it first bought it. At the end of the viewing she asked me if there was a anything I wanted to tell her.
I said no obviously.
"When waiting staff at a restaurant hand me a plate and say Mind, it's hot, I deliberately touch the plate just to show off how hard I am. Even if it burns my fingers, I grit my teeth and show nothing on my face. I win."
"Someone I worked with, but still have on socials is always blogging their adventures & posting pics of their perfect life. They just put up that they're pregnant, so I look forward to their adventures in shitty nappies & sleep deprivation. Petty, yes. Do I care, Not a jot."
I once designed a leaflet for a West End show and included the word COCK in almost-invisible tiny letters in the hair of one actor had been a particular cock to me at the photoshoot.

I practice my rimming skills on bagels...the smaller the hole the more realistic.
Years ago I thought it would be cool to burn my finger prints off in case I did some crimes or something. Now I can't unlock my phone with a thumb.
"I absolutely love that we have to wear masks now, as it covers my bad skin and yellow teeth, and just shows my only good physical feature, my eyes. Masks forever please"

"My wife died in a car crash. Days earlier she told me she was planning to leave me for her lover. Now I've got the house, a decent pay out from her employer and bachelor freedom. "
I also got a sympathy shag off one of her friends. Life is good.
Whilst at college in the 80s a friend worked at Next and stole to order. A lad in my class heard about this and gave me £50 to get him a jacket. I spent this on beer but bought a jacket for £3 in a charity shop. He loved it and wore it with the sleeves rolled up à la Miami ...

"Went to a get together with work colleagues in Jan. There was a buffet, drink flowed, and the v drunk host admitted to donating to Tommy Robinson. At some point I snuck away and I threw a load of sausage rolls under his decking. The next week he told us he had a rat problem."

"I deliberately eat out of date sushi in the hope I'll get food poisoning, because if I do, I'll get time off work, shift half a stone and it's also half the price. Win win win in my book."
"A few months ago I ran my life partner's picture through the FaceApp aging app. The resulting picture of him as an old man was so repulsive I just can't unsee it, and the thought of growing old with him makes me really sad."

I enjoy leaving it several hundred days before I back up critical files on my laptop which if lost would ruin my company

When we were kids me and a friend put a sorry we scratched your car note on a random car with the number to a takeaway place. I broke before she did and ended up crying to my parents at one in the morning

"I used to live above a phone box with 2 pubs very close. We used to phone it at chucking out time and tell them we knew who they were and we knew what they'd done, never explained just told them to stop doing it. The faces and reactions were priceless."
"My wife annoys the fuck out of me 80% of the time, but she's the best shag I've ever had."
"For the past 20+ years, I have been regularly telling close confidants about the greatest smell in the world. Put your little finger to the back of your mouth, scrape your tongue with the nail and smell the finger. Exquisite."

I sometimes ignore the directions that sat nav gives me just to hear the anguish in the robot woman's voice.
"When I moved into my new house, having an en suite was a novelty to me. Now I've learnt that I can't blame the pan skids on the kids, & the wife goes mental at me. The novelty has rapidly worn off."
"I cant put sugar in my coffee without singing the start of the smiths song. Bigmouth strikes again. Sweetners, sweetners I was only joking etc. I hate myself."
Every 6 months I kill one of my wife's plants by pouring gin in the soil. They take up so much fucking room! Shitty thing is she just gets a new one.
Once took an M&S cake to my work's 'bake a cake for cancer' bullshit event. A few bashes round the edge and it looked pretty much homemade. I won a rosette.
Whenever I get a text or message I rarely answer straight away to give the impression I'm out and about living some kind of life. When in reality I spend the majority of my days at home alone.

"I shampoo my armpit, crack and pubic hair, as well as my head hair. I genuinely have no concept if this is normal behaviour or not."
My wife's name is Karen. She hates the Karen memes. But she's actually the most Karen of Karens you will ever meet. Any chance to complain or make a scene and she's like a fucking Oscar winner hamming it up. It irritates the life out of me. She never used to be like this.
"Used to work in a DIY store circa 1998 and got flirty with a cashier, we used to send each other utter filth via pager, ended up shagging her in the warehouse most Sunday mornings or Friday evenings as our shifts always overlapped. Homebase always brings back good memories now"
"I filled in a form on the internet a few years ago and put my name as Nob Jockey thinking that would be the end of it. To this day I still get calls from places trying to sell Mr Nob Jockey insurance, when I'm having a shit day it brings a smile to my face."
I always laugh at Needs a hard drive check tweets but I fear someone checking mine.
"Whenever my married bf pisses me off I fantasise about telling his wife about us - then I think fuck it, she can have him and his bullshit"

"When I was 14, I had a Roblox girlfriend. We phoned each other and skyped. She was from Wales. I couldn't understand a bloody thing she said. Mum made fun of my virtual gf. I pretended I got cancer and died so I didn't have to speak to her again."
"When using a urinal, I like to use the child's one as it makes me feel like a giant."
"I work in IT for a multinational. Since lockdown, I wrote scripts to do most of my job. I now toil for 2 hours a day max and am the top-rated guy on my team. My managers don't know how little work I do. Spend most of my day wanking. It's a good life for £70k."
"Each time i use a urinal I adopt the stance of a Superhero, clenched fists on hips, chin up & a distant gaze into the distance."
Sometimes I speak made up Latin to my cat. I imagine I'm a Roman in the times of Jesus. He has no idea what I'm saying anyway.

I once went to two fortune tellers in quick succession after I'd split with my girlfriend. Both of them told me my next relationship would be with a man. I was so scared I started going out with a girl a knew but wasn't crazy about just to prove them wrong.
"I've led family and friends to believe I'm a lover of expensive single malt whiskey, which they buy me as presents. I'm not, I drink it with cola or lemonade."

When no one is looking I dribble spit and my dog licks it from my mouth.
"I keep a tub of Smash instant mash potato in the cupboard, and whenever I feel peckish I grab a handful and eat it dry. I never add hot water and make it up into mash, because it tastes fucking disgusting."
I had a racist taxi driver spout about 'foreigners' and 'immigrants' all the way home from pub. I pretended to be asleep for most of the journey - steaming drunk - but had enough wits about me to surreptitiously wipe my arse on the 20 note I gave him. Keep the change.
When I get on the motorway I think 'if I drive fast I can get ahead of all the lorries and then just take it easy with a clear view ahead'. But I have never been able to get ahead of all the lorries. There's always one more.

I judge music on whether it would make good walk out music if I was a wrestler or a darts player.

I put porn on the projector in my bedroom for the first time and realise that these are the biggest boobs I'll ever see in my life
I work in a busy international airport on security. Many famous people have passed through the gates down the years. The ones who are rude I make go through additional security checks which they hate. Serves them right for challenging flight safety.

I spent a few years as a customer service helpline advisor for a mobile phone company. The only thing that got me through the day was saying 'fuck you very much' instead of 'thankyou very much' to customers. Try it they sound the same.
I use a location spoofing app to cheat at Pokémon Go

I was once drunk & asleep on the tube. I woke up & was sick on the seat next to me. There was a fellow drunk unconscious man in that seat. I couldn't stop it. I covered him in sick. He didn't move. So I got up & got off at the next stop: leaving him to think he did it to himself.
I feel bad about it but often wonder how blind people know when they can stop wiping their butts
Despite the fact I work at a university I know full well the overwhelming majority of degrees we offer have no value to future employers. I know that because they have been telling us for years but we ignore them to keep the fees coming in.
At 15:00 on Monday I ate a stress pie alone in my van.
I told my wife I pissed in the shower once and she went mental. I piss in it every morning.
"I bake and decorate cakes for birthdays, baby showers etc. I can decorate them incredibly well, but I can't actually bake a cake for shit. I used the asda boxed cake mix. I justify it to myself by telling myself if it was easy to decorate, they wouldn't be paying me £60 to do..."
"I lick the spoon after I've fed the cat his gourmet salmon tinned cat food, it's nicer than waitrose salmon pate"
I have measured my nob every week since my late teens. I am now 41. It never quite reaches the 6-inch threshold but I keep measuring in case one day it does. I wish I could stop.
"When I was young, my Dad told me snot was decomposing flies that had flown up your nose. I believed this until I was 19 and my biology-studying boyfriend told me otherwise. In bed. Embarrassing."
I used the 'mortgage break' scheme to save thousands during lockdown even though I worked more hours than ever. And my new payments have only risen by £8pm due to interest rates plummeting. Thanks Boris.
I get paid £55k a year and since March have worked on average 4 hours a week. I hope this pandemic never ends.
"The greatest thing to come from lockdown is the freedom to fart in meetings. On mute, with nobody but yourself to wallow in your own stench; it's liberating. I'm a board-level woman."
I like to pretend I'm Mancunian and even talk with a manc accent. I give it the big I am about Manchester United but supported City till I was a teen because I liked oasis and blue is my favourite colour. All this despite I live in a small welsh village.

I had a vasectomy. My balls definitely hang a little lower. Took a while to get used to their new position.
I haven't failed a student assignment since 2012. It's just too much hassle organising resits. The external examiner rubber stamps it. I've won praise for my 'student retention success'.
I'm secretly over the moon that our wedding was cancelled this year due to COVID. It's given me an extra 8 months to try and get out of marrying a guy I don't truly love.
"I really wish I had a gang of friends to miss during lockdown. I used to and I don't know why I don't now. I'm still fun to be around, I'm popular at work. To be frustrated about not being able to see friends for a few months or be bored of endless zoom quizzes must be amazing."
"I sadly get excited about a rare invite to a party of old friends and think That went really well, maybe I'll start being included more now only to see a month after that one of them hosted another party, with the same people, without me and I hate that I never know why."

"I forged my cousins A-Level results certificate, getting her into Uni. No-one ever checked and she got her degree."
"I started wearing proper cycling shorts recently when out on my bike. Thing is, they're so damn comfy I don't want to take them off, like someone constantly cupping your balls for you."
"When my cat wants me to get out of bed and feed her, she tries to wake me up by walking over me and sniffing my face. I pretend she is a hunter robot cat looking for remaining humans to kill in a terminator style version of the future. I play dead and try not to breathe."
"Went for a poo at work, bit smelly, courteously used the air freshener, spraying down rather than up to avoid setting off the smoke alarm. Colleague went in and slipped on the glossy surface and broke her shoulder... Sorry."
"8yo me playing with my mum's lighter and a candle - some wax dripped into the nozzle. Sparked it again and a 9 inch flame shot out, so I put it back sharpish before I got in trouble. Next cigarette Mum burnt her fringe off and later got £3000 compensation from Bic. She never ..."

I just found out adobe creative cloud has not been charging me VAT because they still have a VAT no from a company I dissolved 5 years ago. Saved me about 600 quid. I had no idea but I'm keeping quiet about it. Americans are all cunts and don't want to pay taxes so fuck em

"For my GF of two years' birthday one year, I bought us a surprise weekend away at a luxury Chateaux in Southern France. She pulled a proper wobbly a couple of nights before, so I decided to take my Mum with me instead as a treat for her. Probably the best time I had with my mum."

"Our only son is a prick. We tried to warn him off excessive partying & drinking in his 20s & 30s, now he's 39 with health issues that were avoidable. He'll most likely die before us. We feel bad for our grand daughters. He's a good Dad to them, they'll be devastated. We won't be."

"After the number of 'pissing in the sink' posts, I gave it a try. What can I say, it's the perfect height. I just flop my dick in, and let it happen. Much easier than standing and aiming for the toilet bowl. Wash it away, and done."
Every time I pull my black face mask out of my trouser pocket I think shit - whose knickers are these?

"When I was 6 or 7 someone told me the woman in the Shiny Happy People vid was Michael Stipe's wife who he'd killed by accident and got away with it. I believed this for well over a decade, and regularly told people my fun REM fact. Now I know the reason for the looks of pity."

In my early teens I went to a historical tourist attraction that had a special stone that apparently granted wishes. I wished for loads and loads of porn. A few years later I had access to a PC and the Internet. Wish I'd wished to get laid loads instead.
There's no bin in my office so sometimes when I want to dispose of a Post-it Note I'll just pop it in my mouth and eat it. No ink poisoning so far. I ate one yesterday and have just realised I should've kept the information on it. Oops.

"In a rural science class in 1981 I tore a piece of cactus off a plant on the window sill and threw it towards the teacher who was writing on the blackboard, she turned round just as I let go and it hit her on the chin and stuck. I'd just like to say, what a fucking shot."

I always thought I was quite good-looking — until I found myself in the front row for the Stones at Glastonbury 2013. The BBC cameraman insisted on filming everyone around me and went to great lengths to avoid getting me in shot. It haunts me to this day.
"The fastest I've ridden my bike on a public road is 170mph. Hard to tell exactly because everything's a bit buzzy at that speed. Chillout - it was an empty carriage way and I was straight up and down. I downsized because that IS a bit mental. So, only 140mph on my current bike."

I'm a 50 yo male & I have a secret stash of Sooty DVD's that I love watching when my wife's at work. It makes me so happy. It's my secret life.
I watched a lot of porn during the early days of the internet that I often get a boner hearing a dial up tone
I had a feeling my GF was on tinder so I joined it on a fake account to see if I could catch her out. We matched and after some conversation she admits that my chat is so much better than her current BF. Really awkward as it's actually me!
"Three kids back at school, wife and I find ourselves working from home and bored. Cue rampant, debauched sex like not experienced in 20 yrs of marriage. Even enjoyed a blow job during my zoom board meeting. Don't know what triggered it, must be the pandemic. Long live COVID-19."
I once got inadvertently kettled in Notting Hill so took it out on my ex cop father in law by shitting in his kettle

My wife snores. I can hear her now. And it's one of the nicest sounds in the world. She's really lovely.
"There was a break in at work a few years back, and the funniest part about it was that someone shat in the foreman's boots. I don't know who broke in but it was me who shat in his boots."
I spent ages superimposing a yellow frame around my Grindr profile pic just to make sad wankers think I've messaged them. A lot of them reply
"Recently, after a row with my husband, I cut up toenail cuttings and cooked them in his stew. He was impressed that I was forgiving enough to make him a nice meal"
"Been paid for published film reviews in magazines where I've not even watched the movie. If you're skilled enough a writer, it's piss-easy money."
"I've got suspected Covid, so my wife has took herself and the kids to live with her mum till I get the test results back , I've not sent my test off yet"
So I can have some extra days peace.
I got really irate at people crying over Princess Diana dying when they'd never met her. Then Robin Williams committed suicide and I cried over a guy I'd never met.
"Ages ago I was bar staff for weddings. Happy couples would provide disposable cameras on the tables at the reception. We would pinch a camera, hide in the loos and take photos of each other's bare bums as a surprise for when they developed the pics. Never caught. #moon"
When someone asks me to pass on their regards to someone else I never do.
After a big shit I often wipe my arse like a DJ scratching a record and sing the start of Chaka Kahn's I Feel For You.
My last boyfriend dumped me after he was convinced I was having an affair with his best friend. I wasn't having an affair with his best friend. I was however having an affair with his sister.
"53. Married. Children. Vehemently anti Brexit and racism. I had a proper, full on, sex dream about Donald Trump. As far as I know, I'm not gay."
My ex had an uncle who always came to family celebrations with his friend. Nobody ever spoke about their relationship and they were adamant they were just friends who had lived together for over 20 years.The family believed it. They were 100% gay when I walked in on them once.
20+ years ago was helping my GF's dad try to speed up his PC and so cleared his Internet cache. I have never seen so many porn sites. He went bright red and it was never mentioned. Dirty old bugger Derek.
"It's been 6 months since lockdown began. I think my wife is starting to notice that I've been drinking at least one bottle of wine a day in secret for the last 2 years, now that I've moved up to 2 bottles of shitty Rosé from the garage."
"Some post arrived for the kids that used to live here. It looked like birthday cards, so I opened them and pocketed the £20 their gran or whoever had sent them."
I finished with my girlfriend of 4 years because she didn't know what a shrew was. She was 28 and it made me realise she was stupid. I am jealous of her new life with her husband. Both probably blissfully unaware of the existence of shrews.

The best confessions from September. Do follow @fesshole if you don't already - plenty more good stuff coming. https://t.co/DwceeHFlss
I changed my Spotify name to 'Empty Slot' so my ex doesn't see I'm still part of her Spotify family account. Been getting free Spotify for 2 years.
As a teacher I regularly write reports where the first letter of each sentence spells out a message. 'Utter cunt' is a particular favourite.
I'm a woman who works in TV. There used to be a wide circular corridor around all the studios at the old BBC Television Centre where they stored sets from shows. After a late night party there once I slipped behind the panels of the Blue Peter set and had a wank.
I really wish there was a pause button on my kids.
"Not so I can enjoy them at this age because they grow up so quickly, but so I could get some fucking sleep."
"Amazon refunded me twice for a £150 product. I'm keeping quiet. Fuck you Bezos, pay your taxes."
Me and a mate found a big bag of holy communion wafers in a cupboard at our local youth club many moons ago. We took the bag and munched the lot. Are we forgiven yet?
I can't cum when having sex. It never really bothered me as the journeys much better anyway. First few times me and my gf had sex she realised and got annoyed. Now I have to fake it each time. I find it mortifying the noises I have to make! Like an unwell donkey.
One of the happiest days of my life was when my daughters's pony died
My missus had an affair so I had one too. We talked about it and we're actually both okay and happy with each other again.
"My neighbours are horrible, their dog toilets in the common close and garden, they come in drunk and have noisy parties waking me up - I'm a shiftworker. When I go to work I now leave a speaker facing the adjoining wall playing 20Hz for 11 hours, it's driving them mad."
"When we're in the cinema waiting for the film to start I use my phone to book the seats around, next to, and in front of us - you can book loads of seats & it holds them for 10 minutes without having to pay. No-one obscures our view and no annoying kids end up sitting near us."
"I have itty bitty hands and you know what they say, they have probably cost me the chance of sex more than once, and there is no possible way to convey the fact that my penis is in fact of well above average size without making things worse."
I recognise that I'm the subject of a Truman Show type experiment twice a week by letting the cameras in the mirror know so you can all stop now
"My husband thinks I don't know he's a rabid Tory, but I've seen his secret twitter account and I'm Divorcing him as soon as the pandemic is over. Also I've been fucking a guy I met on the local Green Party facebook page, who has a much bigger dick and isn't a cunt."
I made a bet on Joe Biden becoming the next president in 2018. 10/1 odds. I'm making thousands. not telling the wife I'm spending it all on drugs.
Every time someone asks for a plastic bag at my shop I call them a turtle killing cunt under my breath. Turtle killing cunts.
Someone keeps sending me $10 on paypal. Don't know them but I keep it. Sent last installment to fesshole. Thanks fesshole you're the best. https://t.co/IzrPjMjlm2

"When I set up the electricity account on my new flat I decided to call it Flat 2 rather than 2nd floor flat. The months went by and no bill came. I rang the elec board up to let them know, still no bill. It's now been 8 years and I haven't paid one penny to NPower"
I carry a pen knife with a screwdriver attachment around with me. If I get bad service in a pub or shop I go to the toilets and switch off the water isolation valves on the taps and cistern. Last pub asked if there was a plumber in there.
"I've never been able to cum while getting a blowjob, just can't seem to get there. Don't know if that's normal, other guys don't seem to have a problem"
"When helping my Mum with her Facebook account, I found out her password. Sometimes I log onto it to get rid of any racist, right wing or conspiracy theory content from her timeline that her friends post, so she won't be influenced by it."
"I'm a musician. I've never worked with anyone famous. 30 years ago on my first date with my now wife, I told her that I did a top secret session with the band Journey and played the lead guitar break on their hit song 'Don't Stop Believin'. To this day she still believes me."
"Found out that my ex was advertising his wares on a swingers site, I joined as different profiles & would describe the sexiest scenarios to him, arrange to meet up and then never show. This was as exciting as our sex life ever got."
I try not to stir my Pot Noodle too much so that sauce particles don't dissolve and so I can eat clumps of moist flavour dust.
"The singer in my band pissed me off at one of our photoshoots, so I subtly photoshopped his nose to be slightly bigger in every photo."
"A mild gang war started round our way, involving several stabbings, after one of the main dealers in the area had his tyres slashed. Soz - it wasn't the other lot, it was non-gang-affiliated me because you woke me up screeching around like a cunt when I had a migraine"
I am a man & have pretended to be a woman on dating sites. This way I got ideas on funny & smart things to write to women on those sites to chat them up.
"Since the pandemic hit I haven't really been going anywhere, and my already hectic wank schedule has increased to at least 5, 6 a day, sometimes 8. Approx 1032 since march."
Me and an ex girlfriend once had sex in a swimming pool changing cubical. The smell of the pool now gives me an instant erection. I swim every single day and I always think about her. That was 10 years ago.
"Once, when my 3 years old niece asked for Peppa pig, I put Scottish Peppa pig on. She calls her mum a cnt now and never stops saying wee. If you don't know what it is, put it on YouTube."
My misses broke her ankle a few weeks ago and whilst I'm desperately sympathetic to the pain and inconvenience she's endured; it's made it infinitely easier to have a sneaky wank without getting caught
"Aged about 11, I was told off for playing the opening bars of Jerry Lewis' seminal hit Great Balls of Fire on the organ of our crappy local church. When the opportunity presented itself four years later, I did it in Ely Cathedral."
"When I was 9, I hid a chubby pupil's lunchbox. I thought he'd discover it in the art box by snack time but he didn't and I forgot about it. By the afternoon, he was standing at the front of the class crying and the teacher interrogated everyone. I stayed silent. Sorry Jonathan."
"I deliberately use Northern Irish sterling when I come back from home in the mainland just to annoy shop keepers, pubs, restaurants etc. I love it when they query it so i can make a big thing out of it and their management tell them they have to accept it."

I work at a prestigious Savile Row tailors. I chalk CUNT inside every Tory politicians suit I work on. I was inspired by Alexander McQueen who did the same with Prince Charles' awful pinstripe double breasted suits
Once left a copy of a porn video in the VHS & came home from school to find my mum had removed it & put it back in its case . I feared the worse but all she asked me was who was in Alan and was it a new film because she hadn't heard of it
I've just told my wife of 25 years that I'm leaving her. There are many reasons but the decision to pull the trigger was made when she informed me she'd made a Spotify playlist for the dog.
Now I'm working from home I've added 'G4W' in my calendar at lunchtime everyday and told my staff it means 'Gone 4 walk' seeing as we're encouraged to get away from the desk. It doesn't mean walk at all.
"Moved from London to the countryside in search of the 'good life', Fucking hate it. No decent coffee or culture. Endless village gripes. Tell my mates it's the best thing ever hoping I can ruin their lives also."
I'm 52 and have to drive for work but never passed my test. I paid a mate to take my test for me in the early 90s when there were no photo ID licenses. I've never had a crash and reckon I'm a better than average driver.
We're fortunate enough to live on a street where house prices are into the millions and whenever we have neighbours round we serve them food and booze from Lidl and Farmfoods. None of the idiots can tell the difference from posh stuff from Waitrose and other wanker shops.
"After a shit I wipe my arse sitting down. A squatting position means sphincter is wide open, job is done in no more than two wipes, usually one. Fuckin seamless. Folk who do it standing up are wrong uns."
My boyfriend is still friends with his very needy ex. I hate her and everything she stands for but nothing hurts me as much as the fact that she still has a profile on his Netflix account.
"My brother looks exactly like Michael Gove. He knows it, we know it, but it's never talked about."
"Whenever I go to McDonald's, I always go back and say they forgot a cheeseburger, saving myself 99p a visit. RESULT!!"
"I regularly buy things I don't need if they're the last one left on the shelf. I'm 44 and single and it's a metaphor for how I see myself, hoping that someone will choose me one day."
"I'm a straight male and after becoming single for the first time in over 10 years have had quite a few sexual partners in the past few months. I don't get why so many women remove all of their pubes. Grooming, fine but no hair makes it look so young."
I have fake Facebook and Twitter accounts to argue publicly with idiot friends and family members without having it effect our personal relationships
There is nothing more triggering to unfortunate looking men than the fact attractive women can get paid to do nothing but look pretty. They cry The looks will fade but at least we have them in the first place. I've scored almost £20k from OnlyFans thanks to ugly blokes.
I buy Aldi gin and pour it into a posh gin bottle. Don't think anyone has even noticed the difference.
"In my young teens I used to get a bus to neighbouring towns, go knocking on doors and ask for the window cleaning money - £3 back then. You would be astounded how many people paid without hesitation. Never hit the same street twice, didn't want to take the piss."

"As a father of two young daughters I've seen Frozen about a thousand times and I tell you what, Anna's way hotter than her stuck up prudish sister Elsa. I bet she's filthy."
"I live in a semi detached house, when my neighbours fuck they're very noisy about it & I'm pretty sure she's faking it. Still, it doesn't stop me knocking one out when I hear them."
"My Mum used to keep a tin under the bed with envelopes she'd gradually fill for church collections every Sunday. Paper money and coins in each one, filled weeks ahead. I'd often steam them open, take the notes and spend on shit like Mortal Kombat for the Master System. Soz God"
"I still frequently listen to Lostprophets on iTunes, instead of Spotify where I listen to everything else, just in case it ends up in the social bit my friends can see."
I am a senior manager in a very large corporation. I have lost count of the number of overseas business trips I have made just to go birdwatching somewhere exotic. Never been challenged by any of my bosses.
I'm fairly sure my partner doesn't brush their teeth very often. Sometimes they have bad breath but I'm too embarrassed to bring it up.
"When I worked in a supermarket we'd have a daily competition as to who could get away with IDing the most tatty, rough, tired people. They'd go away feeling happy. Ooh they thought I was under age."
"I never bother with toilet brushes, they're filthy. Just grab a bit of bog roll, reach down and wipe the skids off easy"
I love the smell of urine cakes. Sometimes I linger in the toilet just inhaling deeply.
"Locals at my pub think I'm a cockney painter decorator, really I'm from Putney and an accountant, but I love the banter and just stick my hand in a paint pot before I head out."
"A friend of mine was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and said that she hadn't had sex for years. We slept together 6 times and it was great, she died a year ago today and I can't forget her"
I have a great group of close friends but I've just realised the only thing we have in common is that we all drink a lot. May as well carry on as finding new friends is hard.
I used to wear a Ramones t-shirt although I didn't know who they were and when I finally heard them I thought they were shit
I once combed my pubes in the bath with my little brothers toothbrush. I still remember his plaintive cry of disgust when he went to brush his teeth. Sorry bud.
"I lied at work and told my bosses that I have a condition with my digestive system which makes me use the toilet more. Im actually just sat on the bog playing candy crush for 30 minutes, three times a day. It's been 8 years now. Still going strong."
My wife and I's go to song for making love together is Ravishing by Bonnie Tyler. She thinks it's because I see it as an expression of our love but it is actually because Hulk Hogan used the instrumental version as his entrance music & I was a huge Hulkamaniac as a kid.

On my wedding day I was walking up the aisle and saw the exit door to my left. I've never wanted to go through a door so badly. 15 years and 3 children later I still think I should have.
I stopped wearing my glasses because I couldn't stand how ugly people are when I can see clearly.
"I once told a girl on the bus I really loved her accent, I didn't I hated it and only wanted to know so I could avoid the region."
When my partner pisses me off I wash his clothes in extra hot water to make him depressed about his weight gain
"I follow a local history page on twitter, often when they post something I comment making up some absolute rubbish explaining elements of the photo in further detail, they always retweet it."
"Due to social distancing layout changes, most stores have turned their security alarms off. My 'scan and shop' at Sainsbury's costs me less than 10% of what's really in my bag."
My favourite cats loves me more than my partner. In both senses. She prefers me & she's more loving than my partner. She's coming with me when I leave.
"I regularly buy a pack of really nice baby vine tomatoes and just eat them all, by themselves, like a bunch of grapes. My wife thinks this is weird so I try and hide it."
I'm not particularly arrogant but I am convinced that I create everything I experience. People and places only exist when I interact with them. I'm often impressed with the books my subconscious creates as i read them. Not sure why my brain keeps making Liam Neeson films.
This has been the happiest year of my life.
"At age 39 I've come full circle and don't get turned on by porn of any type anymore. Most of my wanks these days involve Countdown, A Place In The Sun or a curated version of my Facebook feed."
"I had a dream last night where I had sex with a work colleague. It was so intense that I went to pieces at work today. I don't even feel like I fancy her, but the dream was so vivid I feel like we've had an affair."
Every morning on my way to work I get a large black americano from the Costa machine in Sainsbury's. I use the self service machine and only put it through as a regular
"My wife insists on doing all the decorating around the house as she thinks she's some kind of expert but she's absolutely fucking shit with paint. I've spent 100s re-buying tins, sanding and filling 8 walls and repainting them when she's been away. She has no idea"
"I once did work experience with a politician. Taking notes, making tea things like that. One day I was left in his office, being young I went through his drawers. I found a photo album full of dogs at all angles. I felt uncomfortable."
"COVID 19 has provided me with the perfect excuse to avoid friends & family, most of all, my mother. Don't get me wrong, I love her, but I can't stand being around her. She's like Hyacinth Bucket, on acid."
"I often read the obituaries in the local paper, because the poems people write about their dead nan are always dreadful and unintentionally hilarious"

"I have a lockdown nipple hair. I've decided to see how long I can grow it. It's currently at 2 inches. I'm a single woman, obviously."
"My 8yo child's gerbil died. Wrapped it up in plastic & sealed it in an Amazon box in the utility room. I forgot where I'd put it, so we had a sombre garden burial with another empty Amazon box. Found the 1st weeks later: chucked it into the kitchen bin."
Someone I loathed died a couple of years ago. Whenever I walk my dog through the cemetery I often make a point of getting it to shit on his grave. I always pick it up though. I'm a responsible dog owner.
"A couple of times I described Brexit as a 'national stranglewank'. My phone now autosuggests 'stranglewank' when I type 'strange'. Sure enough, I sent a message to my boss that said 'it's a bit of a stranglewank situation'."
I have been with my wife for 14yrs and it is bliss. Having kids was the best thing we ever did. Every day I thank my lucky stars that I met her and my life is turning out the way it is.
My partner tells everyone how amazing I am and how lucky she is to have me. I'm OK I suppose but it's largely down to the previous men in her life setting the bar so staggeringly low.
"The dog is now the only member of my immediate family that comes to give me a hug. They say it's childish to want a hug, but even as a 45 year old man it makes me so happy."
Recently joined a university Facebook group. Realised the majority of alumni on there are still the same arseholes they were 20 years ago & there's a reason why we never kept in touch
"A friend has been posting photos of her child every week since he was born, celebrating that week with incredibly mushy captions. It's now 49 weeks and I'm staring to despise the little shit. I just hope she stops when he hits a year"
Years ago our local Kwik Save supermarket had a walk-through fridge section with Insulated curtain strips on either side. I went in with a sharpie and wrote a W before the logo on all their stock of Anchor butter.
"When I was 13 and started masturbating, I would always finish down the side of the bed that ran along the wall. After a few months the smell got so bad that my dad had to get plasterers to fix the damp patch."
Whenever I come across a celebrity's mobile number at work I store it in my phone so I can see what their WhatsApp picture is. It also gives me an ego boost.
"Mum, I'm 45 now and I still prefer raw mix to a baked cake. What are you going to do about it, eh? Nothing."
Whenever I take a knife out of the kitchen drawer I always want to twirl it my fingers around like an assassin in movie. But I never do because I lack the requisite skills and would probably end up in A&E.
"back when I was a student, working a minimum wage shift by myself in a corner shop, I'd take one slice each out of the middle of the sliced loaves and reseal them, allowing me a daily source of free bread, no customers ever noticed"
My username on PornHub is coolfish and a few weeks ago I donated like £30 to a cam girl and I was the top streamer. She then started erotically saying my username so I basically paid £30 for a camgirl to say coolfish erotically while rubbing herself
When I was ten years old I brought home someone else's artwork from school at the end of term and passed it off as my own. My dad was so impressed he had it framed and 32 years later it is still hanging on the wall at the top their stairs.

"I teach GCSE English. This year, students were all awarded our predicted grades. One boy was clearly capable of an A, but because he was such an irritating little scrote I predicted him a B. No regrets whatsoever."
"I wish I could get rid of our cat. I never wanted her in the first place, and now she's pissing on everything. I'd send her to Battersea if my husband and my own sense of shame would let me. The benefits do not outweigh the ballache and expense."
My dad gotten beaten up and robbed leaving a strip club/brothel. The hospital called our home number after they patched him up and I answered. I went to collect him and 30 years later I still haven't told mum the full story.
It's really annoying when you're trying to wank and you've got a cut on your right thumb in exactly the wrong place.
"Whenever I serve ham or pork to my 4 year old daughter, I always make sure it's on a Peppa Pig plate"
I am a voiceover artist with my own studio and frequently record my own loud farts whilst recording just so I can make myself laugh before editing them out and sending the job off.
As 80s teens we picked a random phone number and said only Bloop to the guy on the other end.
He was now Mr Bloop
For about 3 yrs we called him randomly saying only bloop when bored. Sometimes as a question. Sometimes an extended bloooooop
Poor bloke. Seemed nice enough.
My sister in law orchestrated a massive row with me 3 Christmas's ago. Since then she blanks me at all family functions. Which is handy because we meet up twice a month to fuck. No-one suspects.
I set Siri on my iPhone to have an Australian accent so now I talk to Siri in an Australian accent. I don't know why I do this.
"When I worked at Krispy Kreme, I would always add an extra donut or two to the dozen boxes when nobody was looking. I would also give kids fresh donuts as free samples instead of the possibly-stale donut holes we were meant to."
"I gave my girlfriend many plausible reasons for breaking up with her. In truth, I just couldn't tolerate her ugly little dog."
"When I'm working and Quincy Jones's Soul Bossanova comes on the wireless or walkman, I have to type on my keyboard in rhythm to the music - and quite right too; this should be the law."
"I invented a new loo that could eliminate piles and alleviate IBS and Crohn's. My company was bought out by big pharma a few years ago and the toilet has been shelved, I think because the company makes loads from piles cream. I don't really care because I'm rich as fuck now."
I asked a couple of friends to help me with my psychology dissertation. I'm transcribing the recordings and their voices are SO annoying! idk if I can meet them face to face again.
"I don't snap the fingers of kitkats and eat them separately. I bite in to them hole, like any other chocolate bar. I secretly love how much that triggers people"
"My husband thinks I'm fat because of steroids and is very sympathetic. I don't take them anymore but every night, when he's asleep, I eat a ton of chocolate"
I have a business of basically being a pimp that my long term partner knows nothing about. She thinks I'm an IT Consultant who keeps getting bonusesLet's hope she never looks up my name on Companies House as it's too unique to pass off even if not registered at my address.

Two friends cheated on their wives with Amsterdam prostitutes on a stag do. I sat with them all at the wedding and felt so guilty. They clearly loved their men too. Wankers.
"Friends had two toilets in their house, one of which was designated the 'poo room', the other should only be used for wees. I greatly enjoyed taking a dump in the forbidden toilet whenever I could."
Worked in Waterstones whilst a student and loved sticking security stickers to people in the shop so they'd trigger the alarm on the way out. Became an expert getting them stuck in non-obvious places; e.g. just behind people browsing shelves so they stepped backwards onto them.
I used to get an erection at the drop of a hat. Now normal porn just doesn't do it. I've advanced from straight porn to hardcore straight porn to fetish straight porn. Now I'm working my way through the same categories of gay porn because the straight porn doesn't work any more
"I always thought my wife would look incredibly sexy in glasses, so I was very excited when the day came that she needed them. Turns out they just make her look like her mother and all those previous wanks seem somehow redundant."
"The day of Princess Diana's funeral was one of the best days of my life, After the funeral finished my dad took us to dixons and we got an n64"
"After getting my first moon cup I got very familiar with my anatomy, to the point that I would check my cervix in the morning to see if my period was about to start. Turns out putting your grubby hand on your partially open cervix is a great way to give yourself an infection."
I used a hairdryer to warm up my wife's side of the bed. She thought I was being cute. But it was actually because I'd spilt part of a cup of tea on her side of the bed
I always ask for my steak to be cooked rare at a Resturant even though I hate it. It just avoids the 'well-done is for girls' & 'rip it's horns off and wipe its arse' bullshit that always prevails from any alpha males that may be sat at the table.
My family think I work really hard from home but when they're out I'm mainly sat on the sofa eating Prawn Cocktail crisps and watching The Professionals.
I'm nearly 40 and never figured out what to ask for in a barbers. I just mumble something about short back and sides and agree to whatever they thought I said. It looks differently shite every time.
Started flirting and then sexting with a handsome colleague months ago. We're both unhappily married. It's been incredibly hot. We finally fucked on Friday and he was 'done' in less than 30s. I'm devastated. It's over. Loser.
When I watch wildlife programmes my main thought is: I wonder what they taste like and how would I cook them.
"I windmill my schlong at my wife when is on the phone to her mother. She says stop it, her mother asks what's he doing, she tells her he's doing the willie dance for you, and the response is what's he like?. I'm 53."
"I've lost around five stone in a year but look at least a decade older. It's nice to be smaller and healthier but when I look in the mirror, I'm honestly not sure it was worth it"
I don't mind my boyfriend going down the pub with his mates at all but I pretend I do so he'll buy me guilt presents whenever he does.
"My Girlfriend told me on our first date she gets excited when she finds extra fries in the bottom of the bag. Ever since, I always chuck a couple of my own in the bag when she isn't looking for her to find. The excitement she gets from it warms my heart."

"My mrs finally got a huge wooden chopping block only to tell me it wasn't for chopping onions, garlic or ginger. It really is though."
I always run my trolley against flowers in Tesco to ruining them because no one ever buys me flowers
I always say see you to people and never good bye because I have a superstitious fear that if I ever say good bye it will be the last time I see the person. I even say see you when I know it's probably the last time we'll see each other. Just in case.

"I secretly like to add salt to my toast in the morning. Jam a crack of salt will liven that up, honey at least two cracks, peanut butter you betcha that needs some salt on top. My blood pressure is the through the roof and I will likely die early, still tastes good."
"Whenever I can't find something, I don't bother looking, I just ask my wife where it is. I know it drives her up the fucking wall, but 9 times out of 10 the reason I can't find shit is because she's moved it somewhere else without telling me. This has been going on for 10 years."

"I should have lied better when my bf asked how many men I had slept with. I halved it but I told him some were married. He has slept with 3 women and never cheated! My number eats away at him, but I am amazing in bed so he is torn. He does not trust me and is so fucking needy."
I used to do job interviews over a breakfast in a hotel and decide if they got the job based on their order. If they went for vegetarian or worse just a bowl of fruit then they had no chance. One guy had a cheese sandwich at 7:15 and I stopped it there

I hate it when cars are parked on the pavements. Whenever I see them I will often key them. Make and model determines the severity of the key. An Audi has a default key of 10 with two keys. This means I put the maximum amount of force on a mortice key and a Yale key.

"I measure the success of my social media posts not by the number of interactions, but by how many of those interactions are from attractive women. I like to pretend that every one is a covert signal they want to fuck me. Yes, I know they don't, but let me have my dreams, okay?"

I didn't try Class A drugs until my 40's but I now look like Al Pacino in Scarface on weekends when I don't have the kids and it's fucking amazing.
It's amazing how many men keep my number in their phones as 'Dave' - ladies check your guys phones ... the what's app pic is normally the giveaway that I'm not 'Dave'
I always keep two unchecked scratch cards at home just so that I can spend the day happily dreamIng that if I won a million I could leave my wife and resign from work. I eventually check them and when I lose I buy two more and leave them so the possibility of escape can continue.
I have started to appreciate the covid face masks as I can now burp and smell my breath. This is almost as good as being able to smell my own farts.
I work at a busy Tesco express. If a customer comes to the till with more than £30 worth of food and stands there expecting me to pack for them I put their eggs at the bottom and make sure their bread gets squashed. This does not apply to the old or disabled of course.

I've been estranged from my mum for years and I've been secretly hoping that covid would get her.
I attend AA meetings. Some people when they speak say you know at the end of every sentence. I count how many times they do it. One person did it 68 times in a short speech. Idiot.

"Not gay but my flatmate is. I get free fellatio of him. He likes doling it out. I close my eyes and pretend it's my girlfriend. She rarely gives them and when she does they're painfully unskilled. Lads, get yourself a gay mate - it's worth it."
"I have confessed on here, and then given myself advice in the comments."
"Company I used to work for 15 years ago. Our usernames were created by the 1st 4 letters of our surname, our 1st initial, & the 1st available 2 digit number. ie: John Smith = SMITJ01. This made an intranet celebrity out of a lady by the name of Tracey Cunningham."
"Parents died £40000 in debt. I inherited their house, sold it & after paying off the mortgage, was left with nearly £40000. Told the debt agencies there was nothing left & to take the estate to court. They backed off & gave up all claims. Money now for my kid's future."

"When my husband & grandchildren are out of the house and I'm alone, i get on all fours and pretend I'm a cat. I've been doing it for years and I can't stop. I even meow and rub my backside up against the door frame whilst purring. It's humiliating. I'd be mortified if someone ..."
"If you were the bloke that looked after the vending machine at LSI Logic in 1990, yes you did leave the machine unlocked, and Gaz and I took all the stock and cash. Kept us in Mars bars and bacon Nik Naks for a week. Sorry."
"We have special cutlery that is supposed to be hand washed, but I just throw it in the dishwasher along with the normal stuff. I'm fucked if I'm wasting my time handwashing special knives and forks for no reason."
"I used to watch a lot of 9/11 videos on YouTube, and went around with a group of people who were always talked about the NWO and Rothschild conspiracy.I now realise how stupid I was, lucky for me I moved and don't know those people anymore"

Thought I'd 'liked' the whole album of a fit as fuck casual acquaintance's new sprog photos yesterday but just noticed I've managed to 'like' the one & only photo of said rugrat hanging off her big milky knocker. Shit.
"I left a lovely girl for a mental psychotic bunny boiler, all because she had her bangers out on social media and I wanted to get a bang on them, biggest mistake of my life, I say 11 years later. If only I could turn the clock back"
I've returned to the office after WFH during lockdown and not being able to smoke weed or masturbate while working is killing me :
My wife accused me of cheating because of scratches on my back and shoulders. They were actually caused by a Macaw at the bird sanctuary... Where I went on a date with my girlfriend.
In the last twenty years our little family have moved around quite a lot. Without fail my wife has fallen out with at least one neighbour per house while I manage to have friendly - if stressed- relationships with them. My wife hasn't yet realised where the problem lies.
Some days I don't flush my toilet because I want to see how nuclear orange I can make the water by the end of the day. Obviously when i poop I flush. I'm not an animal.
"When we bought our flat, I used to forward on the previous resident's post. After a few weeks I got a sniffy email asking me to stop because he'd changed all his addresses - he clearly hadn't. Still get his mail 3 years on. Some of it is clearly v v v important. Straight in th..."
I pop the seed pods on Himalayan Balsalm even though I know how invasive and destructive they are for the environment. Its just so satifying when they burst. I show other people how to pop them too.
"I'm still 'friends' with my ex-wife on Spotify and I can see tunes she's recently listened too, but I suspect her boyfriend uses her account because her music taste was never this good for the 15 years I knew her"
"When I take a piss, I always flush before I've finished. Sometimes I'm still pissing after the flush has finished."
By the time I go back to work my foreskin is going to look like a quaver after all the wanking I'm doing in lockdown
"Despite all my promises to my wife, I've done absolutely sod all about the spiders in the downstairs toilet. I like having it to myself."
"When my boss got made redundant, he cried down to the phone to me. I was telling him how sorry I was for him but at the same time I was fist pumping because in reality he was a tosser and he deserved it."
"Lying in bed with an ex girlfriend, she whispered something into my ear. I couldn't hear, so asked her to repeat. She did this three time's before I just guessed and replied er... no. She dumped me three days later. Over 20 years later, and I still have no idea what she said."
"I hate babies & small children. HATE. Most women my age are pumping them out, and I just can't fathom it. All the drool, poop, slobbering, crying. Fat, sticky fingers on good-for-nothing parasites. Ugh. So glad to be childless!"
I have ensured I get paid the highest hourly rate at my place of work. I do this by taking the most senior manager's salary and calculating how few hours I need to work to easily surpass his rate. I only do 'actual work' for 2 hours 21 mins/day. Still hit all my targets.
"Inspired by Fight Club and project mayhem, Me and my friend attempted to make a flour bomb using flour and a firework. We tested it in the park, it was a total failure so we set a bin alight. "
I was in my thirties.

"At 18 I could lie on my back, bring my knees up and pop my little chap into my mouth. Just the tip. Underwhelming, to say the least. Hard to reach the goal when nervous about a back injury and the sensation is nothing like when someone else does it. Get a friend to help instead."
I once went on a massive coke binge with two members of a very well known boyband. I took some sneaky pictures throughout and still have them saved on my phone just in case I need them.
"We found our perfect house but it was only the second one we looked at and he insisted we look at some more, we did, for a month, none were as good, it got sold, now every day I wake up in a worse house in a worse area and it eats me up inside."
"A friend of mine asked how to do a poo sample for the doc. I told him to put his feet through the handles of a plastic bag, shit into it, then cut the corner off to squeeze some into the sample pot. He did"

I usually buy an 8th of weed every 3-4 months but just got an amazing deal on an ounce. I feel like Scarface. I've never seen so much drugs.
I bought my husband a fancy mug from M&S with his initial on. He was very surprised and so chuffed with it as I'm normally pretty horrible to him. He thinks the 'C' stands for Chris. It doesn't.
"When no one's around, I like running up stairs pretending I'm on the Travelator, the final part on Gladiators with Wolf chasing me."
"I have had a fried egg sandwich for breakfast every day, including Christmas, since 2008"
I generally dislike most other people so lockdown has been great for me. I'm really not anxious for any return to 'normality' and would happily stay in my house forever
I worked as a gardener for a total asshole and kept a lot of the industrial strength weedkiller. One night I went to his house and wrote 'FUCK OFF' on his lawn in six foot letters. It took a week for the grass to die and reveal itself. Seeing it was the best feeling ever.
"I'm lonely, but in my early 40's I just don't know how to make friends. I'm convinced no one will want to bother being friends with me. I pretend to be happy."
"I keep having crying fits. I'm a climatologist with two graduate qualifications, and starting third in September. We're not acting quickly to end fossil fuel use. The world is burning. My work literally charts the end of civilisation, and maybe our species, in our lifetimes..."
"I am tempted to squat and shit in the cat's litter tray, just once, just to see how the experience varies from using an actual toilet. I feel it would need to be slightly soft/runny to be worth it."
In the '90s an annual Cambridge-London bicycle race went through my village. For several years my mates and I would take great pleasure in moving the direction arrow signs and then counting how many laps the cyclists did before realising something was up.Record was 12 laps.
I have had a veruca on my foot for 3 years. I can't be bothered to get rid of it. It's not like it's doing me any harm
"As a monogamous bisexual guy married to a woman, the main thing I miss about gay sex is having someone to be really pleased to see my cock. My wife likes my dick and all,but I miss that the vengabus is coming level of excited reaction when i pull it out."

"As my wife has got older I've found her body sexier: her hips, arse and belly look so good. My main wish in life is that she felt as sexy as she looks rather than being self conscious about aging."
Lockdown has been brilliant on Grindr. I've never had so many bored married men desperate to get away from the wife and kids come round to my place whilst using the supermarket run as an excuse to blow me. Thank you covid19.
"I have never succeeded in signing my name the same way twice. On any documents, passport, bank cards, cheques, letters, whatever, two signatures set side-by-side always look like the work of completely different people. I've only ever been challenged on it once, in a Cineworld."
"When I was a kid, my brother offered to swap all my ZX Spectrum games - about 15 of them - for 10 Dime bars. I agreed, ate the Dime bars, then told my mum he'd nicked all my games. She made him give them back."
"I'm a man with a separate fake Twitter account as a woman purely to entice unsolicited dick pics. I'm not gay, I just want to freak them out when I let the perverts know the truth. I don't recommend it - there are some sick bastards out there."
Mandatory face coverings has brought some mild excitement to my reasonably mundane life - I walk into Co-op whilst bringing mine over my face and imagine I am about to pull a daring heist.
I gave up smoking 6 years ago with help from the NHS. Turns out it wasn't that hard to do so I used to sell my prescription inhalators on eBay. Bought myself a Xbox and my kids got iPads. #thankyouNHS 🌈🌈
My husband is having a crisis about balding so has started growing his hair to compensate. He's now started putting it in a top knot. The worst part is - I don't hate it
I once phoned a Mr Kipling from the phone book and asked him if he served fondant fancies
I had a one night stand with a minor celebrity about 20 years ago in a budget hotel in the Home Counties. We were both coked up. I took a shit in the sink and she later fell asleep naked in the fire escape. I have followed her career closely since then.
"My husband is an awful person; however, he's extremely wealthy and hung like a carthorse.It's amazing what you'll forgive for a life of luxury and fantastic sex."
"I worked at Subway as a teen when they handed out loyalty stamps on cards for free subs. My manager threw them out once a month, like 100's, and I raided the bin. I didn't pay for subway for four+ years and sold the ones I didn't use for half price. Felt like a King."
When I was young I thought cats were female dogs
"Whenever my neighbours park in front of my house I drop a couple of dollops of paint stripper on their car in the appearance of bird shit.Sadly this hasn't stopped the parking; however, the little bits of peeled paint on their cars give me pleasure every morning."
When I was young I used to wish that Adam & Eve never ate the apple as I believed that it would mean everyone would walk around naked and I'd get to perv
Been a chef 20 years. When cooking sirloin steaks I always remove the little bit that hangs off the end for myself. I call it the chefs discretion and I've had thousands.
I'm a 38 year old woman. I've just had a sex dream about John Cleese's headmaster character from Clockwise and I'm generally happy with this development

"I married my gf from uni, cos she had great tits. She was the worst sort of Cheshire Tory, self-centred, despised anyone weak or poor or 'lefty tossers'. She drank herself to death over ten years. Nothing I could do. I'm 36. Half my life has been emotional hell because of boobs."
"Best confessions -&gt; https://t.co/Cdi0ANqL8fAdd YOUR confession -&gt; https://t.co/We2jXkDjwfAre all confessions used as tweets? No, it's moderated"
"I discovered my husband had been having an affair with a girl he worked with, weeks after we got married. It took me 18 months to tell anyone what had happened because I was so embarrassed to admit it. I went into a dark place. Got over it by banging a fit guy from work though."
I'm a reasonably successful writer for a famous UK comic. Every time Editorial buys a script from me they give it to the same artist. Just passed the 100 page mark. They think we go well together but I think his art is fucking rubbish and he's destroying my reputation.
I bought a Sega Megadrive to appease a school bully and never forgave myself. I was a Nintendo man.
"I once won £20,000 in a competition on a packet of M&Ms which I stole from my flatmate. I deny stealing them to this day"
"I just killed a wasp in my bedroom with the first book to hand, a copy of Adventures of a Young Naturalist by David Attenborough. Sorry wasp. Sorry Sir David."
At uni I took out a bank account that offered students a £2k overdraft and very quickly rinsed it on booze and class A's. It's never shown up on any credit report. I often wonder about how that can happen and hope it wont ever come back to haunt me - with interest!
I broke into Glastonbury festival last year — I simply walked up to the gate and when asked if I had a ticket broke into a sprint. It was dead easy and I'll probably do it again.
"I like swigging my anti-depressant down with a glass of red wine on a Friday night. Makes me feel like a sexy, wild drug addict from a movie."
Pretty sure my ex's dad didn't get his cancerous mole checked out earlier because certain death was better than having to live with his horrible wife and children
I was 21 and a virgin when a girl decided to take pity and shag me. I'm now 49 and have just met the child we made. He tracked me down as he's about to have a kid himself. I had no idea. #instantgranddad
In the early 90s I was a paperboy. One Sunday I stole a newspaper because it was printing extracts from Madonna's Sex book
The last person I had sex with had a orgasm face that reminded me of Donkey from Shrek
"I turned 40 this week. I've never worked I don't claim benefits never married, never had children.I've always enjoyed an utterly relaxed and carefree approach to the fortunate situation I am in.Now I'm starting to feel that I've wasted the best 20yrs o... #Idontclaimbenefits"
Every night after cooking I plunge the hot frying pan into cold water. I close my eyes and pretend i'm a blacksmith. I open them again and carry on working in Marketing.
I'm a doctor and I often wonder if I'd make more money using my skills and knowledge to be an assassin.
"I use the birthday reminder annual notification to cleanse my contacts. If the only interaction we have is 'happy birthday' once per year, you're out"

I encourage my husband's cycling hobby but secretly hope he gets flattened by a lorry on the A62
I have on two separate occasions found myself at parties in the homes of Britpop stars from the 90s and have taken a shit in their gardens. Both incidents were impromptu and unplanned but I then set myself a target of achieving a hatrick. 24 years later it remains a pipedream.
I always use the conservative politics filter on bumble. I'm soft left but the quality of girl in looks and personality is far better on this setting compared to liberal.
"I give people the impression that I shower everyday sometimes twice a day by casually mentioning it in conversation, I don't. I might have 2 a week with daily 'army washes'. Fuck em and their stupid daily showers."
I blu-tack £100 notes to the bottom of the dining table when playing Monopoly.
"I voted Conservative in the last election, but in the last month I got a job in West London and have been looking for a room to live. I'm radicalised now. NOBODY needs more than one home in London. Landlords are parasites."
I look remarkably like a VERY famous British actor. About a dozen times a year I get asked for 'my' autograph. I happily oblige and write the name of my famous doppelganger in the block capital handwriting of a five year old.
The other day I had a crafty midday shower wank to pornhub on my phone while fam downstairs but the sound didn't work. Later I realised phone was paired to Alexa in the kitchen.
"I'm an amateur blogger. A few years ago one of my parents fell ill, so I drafted an obituary post about them for my blog. They didn't die, but I enjoyed the process so much I started doing it for all my family, friends and colleagues. I update them regularly."
One of my colleagues has one of those realistic dolls that they dress and treat like a real baby. I always thought she was a bit weird but now I can't look at her the same way. I know she's not hurting anyone but still weird.
I read the reviews on screwfix in an oi oi cockney accent
"I've been married more than 20 years, my lover almost 25. For three years now we have used a Radar key to get into disabled toilets in public places to have sex. The sordidness turns us both on. We almost never say a word to each other."
"Sometimes if I get a notification that someone liked my joke tweet, I'll click on it and then laugh again at my own joke. I'm lonely."
Went to a school disco event in London dressed as a schoolboy. Lost keys so blind drunk came home & tried to break into my house. Kind neighbours heard the noise & offered me absent teenage daughters room to sleep it off. Awkward walk of shame the next day...
"2 years ago I found my wife's secret twitter acc. She was posting pics in underwear bit of nudity, nothing explicit. I followed, we chatted. I found out things I wish now I hadn't. We've been married 20 years I'm heartbroken. I can't confront her."
I brought a girl home once with the intention of having sex with her. Turned out she was an obnoxious person and I really wanted her gone. Thank goodness for Shostakovitch and his 7th symphony. She didn't want to hear about the siege of Leningrad either and left sharpish.
"Don't know if it's her position on the bowl or the angle of exit, and there's something odd about her anatomy, but my wife's poos always leave a stubborn mark on the right-hand side of the porcelain. You'd think I'd mind but I enjoy trying to shift them with my powerful wee jets."

"My wife watched Love Actually in July. It is wrong, it is a December movie. I think less of her for it."
"I'm low on money. Ate berries from the park for lunch, they gave me the shits so bad I bit my tongue with pain and now I'm bleeding from both ends for trying to save a few quid."
"I'm an abstract painter who sells work. I regularly paint a cock and balls on the canvas before I work on the main painting, in the hope that I become famous after my death and art experts x-ray my works to study my technique."
"Some of the places we take my daughter give balloons out to kids, and I have to deflate and dispose of them eventually. When I do I like to cradle them in my arms and whisper shhh comfortingly as I snip off the valve."
Once challenged myself to wank to the first woman with a picture I got from spamming random on Wikipedia. It was Thatcher. I completed the challenge.
Lost my virginity on 9/11. Between the first and second tower coming down
I pretend I voted to leave the EU just to wind people up on Twitter. I never vote.
"I had sex in the store room of a charity shop. As I came I made eye contact with a life-size cardboard cut out of Humphrey Bogart. Now whenever I see his image, I give him a wink."
"I'm relatively famous and if a member of the public recognises me I tell them 'Oh God, I'm not that guy. Apparently he's a right paedo.'"
"If I'm round someone's house and I see there's Google home or Alexa, if I can get a minute on my own, I'll set 5 or 6 random alarms to go off throughout the night."
"I was once cooking spaghetti carbonara but it was 2 am and I didn't have any mushrooms, so to substitute I used the fungus on my bathroom floor caused by excessive damp. Not bad. But though I washed it thoroughly it still tasted quite substantially of my own hair and body sweat."
I work in PR and it's the most shadiest industry there is. Some of what do we for clients is harmful for democracy and intentionally misleading to the public but everybody acts like it's fine.
"Brought a girl back a few years ago and while ripping each other's clothes off a £20 note fell out her pocket, which I expertly nudged out of sight with a spare foot. When it was time for her to leave, I graciously returned it to her and told her to get the taxi home on me."
"I love my wife, and our kid, more than anything else in the world. But she wants another baby, and I'd rather have a vasectomy on the quiet than go through all that again."
"When I see shaved headed topless men in the park, drinking Stella, in hot weather like this. I'm secretly envious because I can't do that now as I'm a respectable man with a family."
"If I don't have a hand towel readily available, I sometimes dry my hands on the dog"
Sometimes when I swot a fly on the window I leave it's dead carcass there for a few days as a warning to other flies. I'm 100% sure it works and they stay away.

"I keep getting emails asking me to go paperless for my TV licence. It doesn't work out cheaper and I resent having to pay anything for the BBC, so I make them post me one every year."
"I told my wife and son that my Spotify account is incompatible with Alexa. In reality, I disconnected it so they don't fuck up my end of year playlist with their Disney soundtrack shit."
I keep a bottle of vodka in the hedge by my drive. Whenever the kids or wife get a bit annoying I just pop out to the car or take something to the recycling bins and have some cheeky swigs.
I once looked after a friends dog. It chocked to death on a small rubber ball as I cooked food. I panicked thinking my friends would hate me for not looking after him so took it outside and ran it over with my car and told them he ran into road as I let him go pee
"I regularly daydream about being lead guitarist in a massive, but cool, band. I plan song titles, album covers, gigs, solo side projects. I'm 50 years old, and can barely play guitar..."
"Faked depression to my wife instead of telling her the truth - I fell in love with another woman. But we never actually had an affair, and she moved away. Now I really do have depression, anxiety attacks, and suicidal urges. The irony is not lost on me. Reap what you sow, lads."
We tell the kids no internet after 9:30 and turn off the WIFI.
"What they don't know is that's the booster extension they connect to, the proper WiFi is labelled as a printer."
"I'm 39, married, I have 2 teenage children, a house, a cat, a car, oh and I am a barrister. "
"Yesterday in town, my dad told me to cross the road because the Green Man was flashing."
The main reason I like wild swimming is because my enjoyment of it seems to piss people off

"I've dipped Rich Tea biscuits in more things than I can remember. Personal favourites include Lemonade, Orange Squash and Tomato Soup"
"Every girlfriend I've ever had has told me that they weren't attracted to me at first but my personality won them over. You might think that sounds nice, but it's really affected my self-esteem. I just want someone to fancy me."
"I've got 2 teenage kids. One's come out as lesbian, the other dresses like a stripper. Not sure who I'm more proud of"
I have never made a salad in my life. I am 45
I work in low paid data processing job for which I'm somewhat over qualified. I now work from home due to Covid. I've managed to write a range of scripts to automate my role. My typical day is now checking the inbox a few times a day and pressing the relevant shortcut keys.
"My wife once sent me to the supermarket to buy mints, I brought back mince. Happy, she was not."
I've had sex more often than I've wanked in life. I'm really proud of this and want to brag about it but it's socially difficult to mention. That's why I'm writing it here.

"I don't pay for my hayfever tablets, I just throw them in the bag at the same time as another item at the self scan...Folk will have a pop for stealing, but fuck them. These tablets cost literally pennies to make, and some of them are marked up at £7! It's a scam!"
"When my wife comes in from a night out with her lesbian friends, sex is a lot better. I'm not complaining. Bit worried though."
"I never donate to Wikipedia, even though I use it all the time. But if I don't deserve a page, they don't deserve my money."
I always thought when people talked about the criminal underworld that it was a network of baddies that lived below the streets and houses . I always avoided grids in case I saw eyes looking up at me and manhole covers to avoid being kidnapped by them .
I invent stories about aliens and post them on UFO forums full of credulous idiots. I claim all my info is from my uncle in the CIA. Favourite one was about how POTUS used to have weekly meetings over tea with the female alien ambassador to Earth until Trump began hitting on her
I secretly look down on grown men that wear football tops. I think it makes them comes across as childish and thick. Fooled into walking around acting as a billboard for some bookies or expensive airline.
"As a child I was convinced I could control the waves in the ocean. I used to stand knee deep and whisper bigger, bigger till coincidently the waves got bigger and I believed I did that."
I spotted the local shopkeeper finding a pound note outside his shop. A few minutes later I went outside the shop looking around the floor and crying. He asked me what was wrong I said 'I had lost my money.' He then gave me the pound note that he had found thinking it was mine.
"I can't seem to high five properly and don't like doing it anyway. Is one person supposed to keep their hand still and the other hits, or do you both try hit each other's hands? Most often it's off centre and I feel like a dork... Just me?"
I've memorised the diagnoses from every episode of House and suggested to the wife we watch it. We are two season in and she thinks I'm a medical genius
"When we were younger, we were into birdwatching. One day while up the mountain we spotted a raven, we hadn't seen one before, so to celebrate we all masturbated on top of the mountain as it flew above us."
"I've recently been suffering from pretty bad eye infections. My eyes stream, and are completely blood shot. The upshot is I can get as stoned as I like and the kids have no idea. I can highly recommend it. I've got an infected contact lense pot if anyone wants to track me down."
"If I'm trying, but unable, to piss in public, I merely recall the 80s Tetley tea bag adverts and internally chant - in a Yorkshire accent - the mantra, Let flavour flood out. Urination immediately follows. 100% effective. Works like t'charm."
"When I wee, I've noticed the stream corkscrews from my penis into the bowl. Is my urethra twisted? Is this normal?!"
"I was store Santa. Woman assigned to till by grotto was a real skiver, always popping to toilet or fag break. If families turned up I said it was fine for Santa to take money as long they didn't need change of fiver. Hid them all down the wellies. Bad Santa eh?"
My dream is to one day buy a packet of salted peanuts and find that every nut is still whole.
"I once wanked so furiously I split my foreskin and started bleeding as I came. The red/white mixture reminded me of the strawberry ice-cream I had in the freezer which I used to cool my bollocks and then ate. It was a beautiful, quasi-religious experience."

Whilst news of an air crash is very sad I am always a bit excited that a new episode of Air Crash Investigation is coming sometime soon.
I often use semicolons in my work emails as I think it makes me look more intelligent; despite genuinely having no idea how they should be properly used.

"When they say 2% milk, I don't know what the other 98% is"
I didn't actually sell my last car. I just forgot where I parked it.
"When my wife asks for the car keys, I always say See these car keys, you'll never get these, they belong to the 9-8 posse. She's not a Public Enemy fan and has never heard You're Gonna Gets Yours. I'm 61, white, but in my head, I'm gangsta."

I don't trust those sinister clocks where the second hand sweeps smoothly around. I much prefer those clocks where they tick along at second intervals.
I'm a 28 year old straight builder and most days go to work wearing women's lingerie. I love the way it feels. Nobody knows I do it. I'm screwed if I have an accident and end up in A&E.
I got so bored in lockdown I did a road trip of the UK coastline on Google Streetview.
"If I'm alone in a lift, I always walk around in a circle when the lift is moving: I love helixes! Just need to find another person like me in order to create lift-shaft DNA."

"Some time ago I talked a middle-aged man out of suicide on a bridge. Around a year later, he killed someone by driving drunk and hitting them with his car. The face of the victim's mother in the local newspaper still haunts me to this day."
Always tidy the house before we go on holiday in case we get burgled. Don't want them to think we live like animals.
"I'm UK Civil Servant. Since March beloved parent & several friends have died - cancer, Covid, suicide. I'm drinking 4/5 bottles of spirits a week, depressed and impotent. Only reason I haven't killed self yet is one day I hope be in room with Boris and set myself alight..."
I met my husband over 20 years ago. He runs a successful business and is probably the cleverest and wittiest person I know; however for some time now I have genuinely worried that he still doesn't know his left from his right
I failed an emotional intelligence test and didn't get the job. Fair. I'm fucking awful to work with. So I studied Daniel Goleman's EQ book. I aced the next test. Got the job. They think I'm a mushy manager. I'm still the same heartless prick.
Probably getting back with ex for no other reason than there's no way to get laid in lockdown otherwise
When my kids are asleep i go to check on them just before i go to bed and i always fart in one of their faces before i go to sleep. I don't have a favourite i spread the love around
I just took a selfie of my anus and I'm shocked by how hairy and grim it is up there.
Sometimes when I read or hear news stories about people who died I think you lucky bastard.

Every now and again when I'm out in public I wiggle my head around and move in an unpredictable manner as to avoid a sniper shooting me in the head.
I'm a woman and I'm super turned on by lesbian porn. But I'm not attracted to women on an emotional/mental level at all. I love men emotionally and sexually. I don't know what this makes me.
My friend has just joined a pyramid scheme to sell perfume and all she does is post on Insta about her new 'side hustle' and being a 'girl boss' and 'taking control of her future'. Babe making £100 from selling knock off perfumes isn't the power move you think it is.

Someone at work as the surname Chisholm. Given the opportunity I always say Jism instead. I'm 44.
Whenever I drive down south I make a point of stopping in Wolverhampton to use the toilets without flushing them and pumping out as much Co2 from my car as possible. Everyone I know from that area is a massive cunt.
In a previous role I found most of my colleagues did fuck all work. I captured daily shots of the docs in the shared drive to see how little development had been done day by day. I sent the evidence to the head of dept. Within 2 weeks there were 9 resignations. Delighted!

"When I was in my early teens I collected my snotters behind my headboard for 2 years, I collected them all up and moulded them into a small weetabix type shape, added some milk and ate it, tasted salty."
My friend has just had her first baby. It is spectacularly ugly. She keeps going on about how gorgeous it is. I can't even lie to say something complimentary about it. It looks like something from a mutant experiment gone wrong.
"It's so annoying when people ask me and my twin which is the evil one. We're in our early 30's now. What on earth are we meant to answer?! We've got responses to every other stupid twin question apart from that one, and yet folk still persist."

"If I fuck up at work, I'm always super fast to own up to it. People think it's because I'm honest, but it's actually because it means if I actually need to lie about something everyone automatically believes me."
I manage to get away with not paying train fares by pretending to be a clueless 14 year old. Have just turned 18.
Work for a fairly well known Scandi furniture company but sitting in my office buying furniture online from a competitor because lets face it the quality is better and price is lower.
Us letting agents all check prospective tenants' Facebook profiles. If you're an aggressive attention machine who airs badly-spelled petty grievances you're not getting anywhere near our client's property.
I bought a hearing aid on Amazon so that people think I am losing my hearing - but I'm deliberately ignoring them.
"On a local common shared by a golf club, I saw a stray ball laying in the grass. I picked it up thinking it had been lost. Only when I saw a golfer searching in the area did I realise that ball had been in play. I didn't put it back, as people who play golf are generally cunts."

I kept the label from a 4.99 bottle of wine from Sainsbury's over a month ago. When I go there now I discreetly scan the label from that bottle and place whatever more expensive bottle I like on the scales. The staff never see and I must have saved about 400 quid by now.
I have never ever cleaned out my oven... I pretend to myself that the food will taste better without cleaning it but in reality there is a 2 inch layer of black sludge which is actually pretty worrying

I'm a man but once I created a Twitter account where I said I was a woman. Whenever I posted a problem I got so much love and support from other women that it left me in tears because I'd never get that posting as a man.

I block out my Outlook Calendar with things I need to do around the house so I avoid joining actual work meetings
The only reason I keep going back to see my therapist is because she is incredibly attractive and keeps telling how much of an impression I make on her. It's also the only moment I get compliments.

Worked in a bookshop where I dealt with many authors doing promotions. Found that writers are all cunts. Once had Martin Amis in. Already imagined what he'd be like - always hated the tone of his books. Actually he was the most charming man I've ever met. Love you Martin.

My cock is really thick but this isn't a blessing. In porn films the women have got used to big dicks. In real life it's not the case. Too many times I've had to settle for a hand job and I can forget about anal.

"When I was 10, I dared my cousin to kiss his sister on the lips, I blindfolded him. I then held up my dogs arsehole and he kissed that instead. He could not tell the difference, and does not know to this day. If you're reading this - I'm sorry, but also, not sorry"

I tried to sabotage a live broadcast of Songs of Praise when I was a child by pulling out random wires and cables from their power source in a church. See you in Hell.
"I've been married 10 years. I'd never talked about sex with my parents before. I had a blazing row with my wife, they tried to mediate. I told my Dad she doesn't put out. He advised me to visit prostitutes. I think he was joking, but I'm going to do it."
I started having sex with other men just because they're so much easier to pull than women.
My other half gets her nails done every month. She always shows me and says 'what do you think?' I always reply 'oh they look nice..' but I genuinely always fucking hate them. All long and pointy and sharp. Its like banging Edward Scissorhands.
For the last year or so I have been shagging the local cafe owner's wife. We do everything for hours at a time. I find it hard to hold a straight face every time they're both behind the counter serving me espresso. My wife wonders why she occasionally she gets free lattes.
I own a large barn which I regularly rent out to a porn production company. I'm allowed on set and have seen it all in the flesh. I told the wife it was a being used by a Am Dram group who are auditioning for Pretty Woman.

"When I'm interviewing a candidate I challenge them to a game of chess. We only play for 10 minutes - my objective is to observe how they approach problems. Also, I don't know anyone who's willing to play chess with me. Non-consensual chess is my only way of getting any action."

Whenever I was bored and among strangers I'd tell people I was Ed Miliband. This was before smartphones were so widespread so no one really bothered to verify it. They were just mildly impressed to be meeting future party leader David Miliband's brother.

"My wife doesn't know I take days off work and drive hundreds of miles just to pick up old 80s computer gear. I hide Commodore PETs, Orics, ZX81s and BBC-Bs in the attic. I can't stop."
"I've been in lockdown with my female flatmate. Nothing particular interesting has happened, and we mostly keep ourselves to ourselves."
"Whilst wanking in the shower with my electric toothbrush up my arse, my wife burst in. I panicked and quickly shoved the toothbrush into my mouth to pretend I was brushing my teeth."
Still cringe about the time in a gym on the treadmill I got absorbed and over excited by an amazing cricket match... it was amazing. Why was no one else cheering? I cheered. It was a 5yr old repeat. And it was highlights
I never told anyone this until now but I think it's fair that I have to pay back my university tuition fees. It's lot Money for sure but I got a good education and spent three years high on MDMA and knee deep in shags. I'd pay double if they asked.
I'm friends with a number of dating bloggers & relationship experts. They constantly moan about not being able to find the right person. Truth is they're all vain shallow horrible twats. I'm also single but at least I know I'm the problem.
"I am a normal, well paid professional who just so happens to enjoy weed, on a very regular basis. Got sick of paying money to random dodgy dealers and have been growing my own for 10 years now. Now I have too much to know what to do with. Autoflowering plants are where its at ;)"
"My girlfriend loves rimming me when she gives me oral. I don't have the heart to tell her it does nothing for me, but she's seen it in porn and thinks it's normal"
"As a teen I was desperate to have sex but aged 14 no girl would even talk to me. One night I secretly prayed to Satan, promising my soul to the devil if I could get laid. A few months later I slept with a girl. Now I'm worried when I die I am going straight to hell."
My dementia ridden grandad doesn't know I'm using his allotment he never uses to grow some lovely cannabis plants.
I got up & walked out during a one night stand. He was mid stride & just terrible but I was too drunk to get on top & make it better. Pretty sure I scarred him for life.
"I work with a bunch of colleagues in their 20s. They keep me feeling young, until today, when one of the girls spilled her salad dressing on her black dress. I commented that she looked to be the Monica Lewinsky of the office. To a sea of blank faces. I'm so fucking old."
"While eating, my wife holds her knife like a pen. This is wrong and I can't believe we're still married."
I'm a painter and decorator and always draw an annotated cock and balls on the wall before I paper over it.
"I hate cutting my husbands hair and told him so but he wont listen, I cut it badly on purpose hoping he'd get the hint but all he's bothered about is saving money! He looks a twat but I'm the bigger twat cos I have to look at it."
I once dropped my phone into a chemical toilet on a building site with about 600 people working on it. Went fishing barehanded to get it back and put it in a bag of rice.
Most disgusting thing I've ever done.

One of my mates started a vegan milk brand and gives me samples whenever I see him. I've told him it tastes good but in reality I think it's absolutely vile and have poured it all down the sink
I use FaceApp to make selfies of me as a man into a beautiful woman. I now have an Instagram account with many followers and are becoming an influencer
"I'm 43, have no babies in the house anymore but my go-to biscuity snack is a Farley's rusk. Forget Penguins, Clubs, even Tunnocks Caramel Wafers.Nothing comes close to a rusk"
I very occasionally allow my dog to eat the poo from the cat litter tray. The dog goes absolutely crazy for it and it seems to be a culinary delight much enjoyed. Saves me scooping it out too.
I'm a 24 year old man who has chocolate spread sandwiches at least twice a week. It's like comfort food at this point.
"I live in a Brexity area. I removed myself from the organ donation register, because the probability is the potential recipient voted leave. You take away my opportunity, to make yourself feel better about being a failure, so I deprive you of my organs when I die."
I'm a woman in my 50s and I hate children. When I'm in the supermarket I pull angry faces and stare creepily at toddlers to freak them out.
"I know of a musician who has 7 sockpuppet Twitter accounts where he pretends to be his own fans. He spends hours every day tweeting as them, I have loads of evidence but can't do anything with the info because he isn't popular enough for anyone to care"
"When we look after our vegan nephew, 4, I often make him ham sandwiches for lunch."
"I get intense pleasure seeing people get caught in torrential rain. I laugh as I drive past them in my dry, warm car. Should have brought an umbrella - you utter idiots."
I always struggled to remember facts and references when doing my degree but knew every word of Level 42's entire output. Everything. The human brain sucks.
"Years ago I had a threesome with my boyfriend & another girl in a doomed attempt to save our relationship. It didn't work. I can barely remember his face now, but not a day goes by without me thinking about her. I wish I had her phone number, or even if I just knew her last name"
"Sometime in the 80's before beards were in fashion I was blind drunk in a pub in Wandsworth. Some bloke as bald as a coot with a large beard was there. I thought it funny to scream you're shaving the wrong end mate! numerous times. I sincerely apologise, it was the drink."
"I work in IT and I use my company issued iPad as my cocaine surface. Perfectly flat and glossy black glass is the only way to roll, plus no scratches from razor blade."
Was once shagging a really hot girl and instead of saying I love fucking you I said i fucking love you and I still cringe about it 15 years later.
Had Colin the Caterpillar for breakfast today.
I'm a fairly successful DJ who has toured internationally for a number of years. I haven't listened to a single track anyone has sent me since March. I really don't give a shit anymore.

One of my colleagues argued with our team that signets and ducklings DID NOT come from eggs. She wasn't sure where they came from and would have to google it but 100% didn't come from eggs. I didn't like her much before that. Now I have no respect for her whatsoever!
"When I get a greetings card at the supermarket I 'scan' it through the self checkout with my finger covering the barcode. When put in the bagging area with my shopping, it's too light to be detected, so it's free. If caught I have plausible deniability that it just didn't s..."
I worked as a risk surveyor for an insurance company. I was sent to a warehouse to assess the insurability of the premises. Porn was being filmed while I was there. I declared the building unsafe so everyone had to leave. Building was safe. Just wanted to cock block the guys.
Sometimes when I can't be bothered to shower I just wash my nob and bum in the bathroom sink
When I repot my plants I pretend they're getting ready for a night out; then before I water them I ask them shall I pour the wine. Don't really know why

I am an English teacher. I love my job. Poetry is fucking shit though. Absolute bollocks it is.
I love my dog so much. The big man is only 4 and the thought of not having him around can reduce me to tears instantly. How do you get over the loss? Am so worried I wont cope :

I work as an escort - clients mostly banker types - and since the Trump 'pee tape' allegations the demand for watersports has exploded. I need to constantly drink water all day to have urine at the ready. Men are disgusting.
When I first began to masturbate I had no knowledge of how reproduction works. I spent a while fearing that the semen I flushed down the toilet had created a fetus in the septic tank.
"I detest my neighbours & daily fantasise about their death. Couple in their 70s, she's deaf & horrible & he's a flasher; also horrible. Militant about parking, willy flashing in the front window when I put my girls in the car for school. Incredibly loud Bond films."
My boyfriend often complains that the charge doesn't last in his toothbrush. I use his toothbrush to clean the gaps behind the toilet seat that I can't easily gwt to with a cloth. I don't feel guilty at all. I wouldn't have to do it if he didn't piss everywhere.
When I was 18 I went to Tenerife with friends. More than once they all went out but I stayed in the apartment to mime air bass In the mirror to Jamiroqui.
In school I had a calculator with hex. I wrote b0110c5 and passed it to the guy behind in a maths lecture. Haha bollocks he exclaimed and promptly got sent out the room.
I won a fancy dress competition at primary school by hiring an outfit from a fancy dress shop. Standing on stage in front of the whole school I lied and said I'd made the costume myself. I've felt guilty ever since.
My brother in law is a cunt he plays in a band at weekends and gets paid in cash he's been doing it for 30+ years the only reason I haven't shopped him is it would upset my wife. When she dies the whole weight of HMRC is coming down on the fucker.

"Most people count sheep to get to sleep. I go through my dream 'I wish they were dead' list. Trump, Pence, Bannon, the entire KKK, BoJo, Farage, JRM.... It's lengthy. Never fails to work."
"I built my kids a massive treehouse so when it rains, I have something dry to stand underneath when I have a sneaky cigarette."
I have a reoccurring dream of burying dead bodies then I realise the police are planning to do a dig in the spot. I have to go and dig them back up and move the body. Sometimes I wonder if I actually have done this
I work with a goth and I constantly change his playlist going through his Bluetooth speaker to James Blunt to really piss him off.
At the beginning of lockdown I found a positive pregnancy test in the bathroom bin. It's just me and my wife and I've had the snip. Neither of us has brought it up yet.
My daughter has been having free school meals for the past year now. We aren't entitled to them she just goes up and gets her dinner and I don't send payment in. Nobody's noticed
I didn't know until today that you can twist a pepper grinder both ways to make it work. I'm 45
I'm really good at making my wife cum but it irks me that that sort of conservation is off limits in polite society. I want everyone to know!
"During lockdown, I bought a pack of 12 adult nappies and when drunk, regularly pop a pair on and calmly wet myself in various locations around my house. Hugely liberating"
"When I was 13 yrs old, me & a few mates nicked a collection box from the local church. It contained 68p. At the time, 10 Benson & Hedges cost 68p.very convenient, I didn't feel guilty at the time, nor will I ever"
In my head I'm having an affair with the cat. I go and give her secret cuddles and fusses when the missus is in another room. Just for a bit of excitement during lockdown. We've still not been caught in over 4 months.
I'm aroused by face masks. I'm not sure if this is the best or worst time of my life.
Working up courage to slide into a bloke's DMs. Pure Twitter crush. But scared he'll tell me to piss off. No idea how to approach it. How do men do this all the time?!
My earliest sexual fantasies when I was around 10 were all based around getting to live inside a giant woman's bra.
"I work in Customs for UK Border Force, I'm genuinely surprised at the amount of Viagra I find in truck cabs. No wonder truckers are so angry - they're almost permanently on the flop."

Every day I think about time travelling back to the first Glastonbury festival with a load of late 80s rave records and a huge bag of powerful Es and wonder if I could have changed music history
"In High School we had to make clay pots for our art exam- mine was shit so I purposely left massive air holes in the middle so it exploded when put in the oven... it blew up everyone else's on the tray so they couldn't find the culprit, meaning I didn't have to get a bad mark"
The great thing about wearing masks in shops is that you can mouth obscenities at people and they'll never know. I mouthed 'you awful wanker' to a particularly stupid customer yesterday.
I skipped a month of rent during lockdown and no one noticed somehow and obviously I'm not gonna say anything
My wife and her family are from the upper middle class. They are all very well educated and went to the best schools. But they all eat like pigs. On some occasions I have to leave the table and go to the toilet till the feasting has ceased. Their toilet habits are not much better
When I was at art college I was a council estate kid on a full grant. All the posh kids assumed I was connected and could get drugs. Initially I sold bicarb and a drop of ammonia with 5% speed as speed. The same but with acetone as coke and my mums Valium as e's. Was minted
"I am grown man. We like to keep a clean and tidy home. I also think that home is the one place where lazyniness should be embraced. When I'm done with my evening snack in front of the TV, I slide the plates under the couch, where they usually stay for about a week."
I work with someone related to a serial killer. They are lovely and every time I see their relations name as a punchline it breaks my heart. Before I met them I used their relations name as a punchline too. It's not as funny now.
"Pre lockdown I'd thought for ages that my relationship was probably terminal, but after a few months apart I've realised that my gf has the best boobs I've ever fucking seen and she's an absolute miracle of a human being. Thanks 'rona"
I reported my boss's shady tax to HMRC after he made a pregnant woman unemployed to avoid maternity pay.
The ensuing investigation nearly ruined him and he became an alcoholic. Then he fell over whilst pissed and had to go to hospital- where he caught MRSA. 
I have no regrets.
A frenetic bout of wanking made my cock all swollen and raw. Didn't want to go to doctor so dipped it in 96% ethanol to disinfect it. It was agony. 3 days later it shed its skin like a snake and I kept it for a while.
My son makes Incredibly detailed drawings and we both tell him they're amazing. Truth is I find them rubbish and quite embarrassing
There's around 2.5k people on my block list on twitter. Nearly all of them are because they've used the phrase 'bet you're fun at parties'. I hate the phrase that bit more every time I see it used. I know I'll be adding more to my block list when this gets posted
After using a €20 fleshlight from Amsterdam I had to peel a layer of dead skin off the entirety of my bellend
"I pretended to like football to advance my career as my director and MD were serious fans. Was dead easy, I just watched motd 2 on a Sunday and remembered something that wound up one of the pundits for a Monday morning chat by the coffee machine. And it worked."
"I once knocked down most of an incomplete domino rally in a church hall, which had been painstakingly built for over 20 hours by three people for an attempted world record. I never confessed it was me. Only Jesus knows."
I play a game where I give very subtle hints to my wife when I find a female celebrity attractive. I then enjoy watching her eternally over-criticising those women whenever she sees them on TV. Recent-ish ones include Rachel Riley & Laura Hamilton.

I like to use childrens urinals as it makes me feel taller. Im 58
Popped into work in the early hours to collect a usb stick I needed. Security guard was fast asleep so I stacked chairs ala Poltergeist next to him. He quit a few days later.
"When the sugar bowl is freshly filled in the work canteen, I place one grain of coffee in it, it well and truly pisses people off"
"Since lockdown, I now measure my life in dishwasher cycles rather than days. The relentless stacking and emptying seems to give life some structure. 118 cycles in."
"Well-known 80s musician emailed the place I was working at with a complaint, giving us the Don't you know who I am treatment. I made a note of his email and continuously trolled him for months for having a number at the end of his unique name because someone already... #unique"
"I think Brexit is a stupid idea, but still took the cash to do the voice over for the TV ad promoting the benefits of it"
Somebody has given Amazon my mobile number instead of theirs by accident. I get a call from the drivers a few times a month asking where to leave the packages. In the wheely bin is my personal favourite.
When I was a teenager I hated my mum's new husband so much I stuck his toothbrush up my arse every day for about five years. A couple of years later him and my mum were divorced. I was really pissed one night and so I rang him up and told him about my toothbrush antics
"Years after we broke up, my ex published a dystopian sf novel in which a character with my name meets the hero, immediately betrays them and is eaten by pigs on the very next pageI am incredibly proud of this"
"In my early 20s, late, late at night, wanking to some porn on VHS in the living room, my Dad tried to walk in. Don't come in! I screamed. Next day, he asked what I was doing. Pretended I was wrapping his birthday present. Cost me a bloody fortune getting him something good."
"I've used a niche reference to Canadian prog rock band Rush in my tinder bio for over a year. It's quite clever and unassuming, so its gotten me a surprising amount of women. I think it might be the only time in history Rush has helped someone get laid."
When I was a stoned student I took a bite of Cheddar straight from the pack in my parents' fridge. I still remember the look of anger and hurt on my mum's face as she silently held up the cheese with my teeth marks in it.
I use Sainsbury's bags for life in Tesco
My ex pays me to have access to a shared Apple Music account. I regularly listen to weird music to screw with his algorithm.
"I've never seen Top Gear, and so for years, in the noughties when people used to wear 'I'm the stig' tshirts, I genuinely thought it was a reference to Stig of the Dump."
"Since moving to the countryside I've never paid for eggs, jam, or honey. I just help myself from those 'honesty' boxes these bumpkins put at the bottom of their drives."

As a northern Irish person I hold a UK and an Irish passport and always feel like an international spy each summer when deciding which passport to use for my two weeks in Majorca with the wife and kids.
Used to play catch and kiss in primary school. Was chasing the girl I fancied round the corner when she ran into a window sill. Chipped her tooth. Didn't fancy her so much after that.
"When making tea, I like to leave the bag in. This way the tea is stronger and, as a bonus, the pyramid-shaped bag resembles a bobbing goldfish giving warm and gentle kisses as I drink."
"For some reason, when I was about 12 years old, I went through a phase of eating Chewitts with the wrappers still on. I have no idea why."
"Early days of Facebook, when it had that anonymous comment box thingy, I used it to tell a completely random friend of friend that she was beautiful. I then used it to call my sister a cunt. My sister told me it showed my identity. I was horrified & blocked the random girl."
I've muted over half of my followers
"When I was 10, I got caught wanking by my mother, my grandfather, my rabbi and my history teacher. Separate incidents to be clear. Carelessness? No I was probably just at it all the time."
Sainsbury's stopped selling own brand cream crackers with sesame seeds in them over a decade ago and I can never forgive the bastards. Just about surviving on Jacobs's these days.
"I guessed my wife's phone passcode, read her WhatsApp messages and now know all about the affair she had, but obviously can't confront her about it without revealing my own awful behaviour. What a mess."
When I was 17 I lucked into a 3some with my extremely fit 19 year old neighbour and her friend. I'm 29 and married with 2 kids now and can't help but feel that was when my life peaked.
I mill my own flour and bake all my bread and cakes etc. The results are amazing but I can't tell anyone as I sounds like an absolute wanker.
Every Friday I set 15 or so emails to delay delivery to various times on Monday. Then I get drunk on Sunday and just watch films all day Monday. This is why I can't face going back to the office
I've always wanted to try Gnocchi but will never order it when I'm out because I don't know how to pronounce it
Today I gathered all my incriminating and potentially embarrassing possessions and threw them out so my family wouldn't find them if I die of Covid.
I like finding geeky guys and pretending to be interested in them. They'll buy anything for me and I don't have to do anything other than the occasional hug and holding hands.I'm 25 and haven't needed to work a day so far.
"When ordering Picpoul from a restaurant wine list, I always ask for pig poo. No one has ever noticed."

"I have gone slightly crazy since lockdown and will now happily stand around my flat, alone, meowing to myself and making cat noises. I am a thirtysomething senior manager and we do not have a cat. Help."
"I used to work in a call centre for a well known high street retailer. We used to play games on the calls, from fitting random words into sentences, to doing fake accents for the entire call. Getting Sausages into a wedding dress order was particularly challenging."
"When I was a teenanger in the pre-internet days I used to have 2 daily daytime wanks. The 1st would be over Judy Finnigan on This Morning, the 2nd over Carol Vorderman on Countdown. Timing was critical in order to avoid spunking over Fred the Weatherman and/or Richard Whiteley."
"A bloke on my street works for Sky TV, yet his van is always at home, even before Coronavirus. He literally never goes to work and I've no idea how he gets away with it. No wonder subscriptions are so high, if he's paid to sit at home."
"I'm growing tired of having to turn on full urine jet power to piss my girlfriend's skid marks off the toilet bowl. FFS, Jennifer, you're a lady. Sort it out."
"I am a married woman in my 40s, I don't show my tits to my husband but let him have the occasional peak while getting ready for bed, makes his day. I do however get them out regularly for anyone else."
"My ex husband is on Twitter, constantly harping on about how much he misses his son and insinuating that I don't let him see him. Truth is he has never tried, not even a birthday card. He spends what little money he has on weed and booze and soaks up the online sympathy instead."
"I'm a fairly big lad, 6 foot 5, and keep bonsai trees in the bathroom so I can pretend I'm Godzilla while taking a dump."
A lecturer mimicked my northern accent when I asked her a question. I never went to another of her lectures or dealt with the posh bint ever again. It's been 15 years and I google her occasionally to see if she has failed yet. She hasn't.
"I capture farts in voice notes and whatsapp them to people, the wonders of technology and this is how I use it"
"My mother, the lovliest person you might ever meet: when she gets a parking fine she always removes it and places it on the car parked in front of her. About half of them just get paid."
"I once superglued a colleagues handset to the base of his old-syle telephone, and then called him from my desk and watched. When he answered, the glue had not yet set, and he glued the hand piece to his ear."
"Every time I stay in a hotel I temporarily remove the pictures from the walls, and make my own permanent ink drawings in the space where the paintings were. Then I put the paintings back. I have made about 50 of these hidden drawings so far."
I have to constantly reassure my girlfriend that I don't think of other people while we're having sex. I can't recall a single occasion when I haven't.
"I'm female, mid-30s, and I can't masturbate. I just can't. I feel silly and can't get rid of intrusive thoughts about my dead relatives watching me."
"Once, when nibbling magic mushrooms as they dried, I ate a small piece of sheep poo."
"Approximately once a month I have a really toxic argument with either the cheese grater or tin opener. They are proper useless cunts but as they've been in the family for years and had good service years, I cannot betray them. But honesty they are wankers"

I have absolutely no will power for biscuits and chocolate so never buy it. My wife buys it and hides it cos she won't support me. I regularly find it and eat it all and have to go to the garage to restock before she finds out.
"I've worked in an opticians for three years and I haven't worked out if there are identical twins working there or if one girl works two roles, sometimes requiring a lab coat, sometimes not. I've left it too long to ask for names."
I told my wife I have been meeting friends at the pub every Thursday evening. But I've actually joined a Warhammer club. I have a pint on the way home so I smell of beer
"I am 48 years old and I get my left and right hands confused, it's only temporary for a few seconds. I served in the army for 14 years."
"I work as a supermarket delivery driver. I was so desperate for a poo mid shift that I had to pull over at the side of the road, rip open one of the customers toilet rolls and proceeded to poo down the side of my delivery van using the customers toilet roll to wipe my bum."
When I go running I often run past the fish and chip shop. It adds an extra spring in my stride to see fat people queuing for their chips.
I've recently started seeing Marge Simpson as a total MILF.
I shaved my bum hole anticipating that it would feel nice and I'd gain advantage when wiping a number 2. I couldn't of been more wrong and now the stubble constantly chafes.
I like to bid on items on eBay during the last few mins of an auction to inflate the price. Luckily I haven't won anything via this means yet!
"My stepson is a lazy, entitled stoner, who refuses to work and just gets stoned everyday. Whilst doing some gardening I found his bong. I emptied the water out of it and topped it up with my piss."
I've posted tons of photos to Facebook of records on a turntable with sleeves prominently in shot; responses are likes and 'Great album!' type comments. The record player isn't even plugged in and I detest every album I post up. I don't even own an amplifier.
When I masturbate I worry that I might have a heart attack and someone will judge me on the porn I would be found with. I keep the porn on the vanilla side for this reason.
"My girlfriend often lies with her head on my chest and tells me that likes my 'strong, steady' heartbeat. I haven't told her that I'm fairly sure that's high blood pressure due to years of smoking, drinking and sniffing."
"When I go through to the kitchen to make a drink, I quite often roll up a slice of honey roast ham, pretend to smoke it like a cigar before eating it."
"In my younger days, down the pub, I'd freak people out by stubbing out my cigs in the palm of my hand. Truth is, I'd only ever do it after surreptitiously having coughed a nugget of phlegm there, which would harmlessly put out the cig with a noticeable sizzle"
I know exactly how many times I've visited Pizza Express in Bromsgrove because very time I've been there I've lifted a teaspoon. They're a design classic IMO.
In 1995 I was invited to join my best friend and her family on a caravan holiday in France. I was 15. My friend and her dad caught me smoking. Although I openly smoked for many years afterwards I have never forgotten the disappointment on my friend's face.

I rarely brush my teeth for the full recommended two minutes.
"I started giving this woman a lift to work because I thought I wanted to shag her. After two weeks of giving her a lift I've changed my mind, she's grossly annoying and now I don't know how to get out of it."
"When I go to the pub with friends I will order a pint of lager, but what I really want is a pint of milk."
I eat butter straight from the pack like a fucking animal
"Whenever I pass the bakery shelves in Sainsbury's - and I often make a detour - I check for scraps of chocolate from the pains au chocolat or cheese matter from the cheese twists. Then I surreptitiously nab them, hold them for a bit and eat them. I'm 44 and have a well-paid job."
I own and run a posh cheese shop in a London suburb and absolutely fucking hate cheese. Can't stand the stuff but I'm in too deep now and have to live the lie.
"Facebook has turned my wife into an antivaxer & 5g conspiracist.She now doubts COVID19 is real & is against mask wearing. She blames Bill Gates, distrusts scientists & says I've been brain washed by the state for disagreeing.I love her but am so frustrated I'm considering leaving"
I've been sexting a chap in Australia off and on for a year. We met on social media under false pretenses and he thinks I'm a bloke. I'm actually a happily married woman expecting my first child.
There's an episode of Thomas the Tank Engine called the ghost train that I still can't watch because it frightened me so much as a kid. I'm 32 years old.
"I don't know how to tie my shoelaces, I'm 40."
"I still find it funny when I take a banana and two satsumas into work for lunch, and have to show a colleague so we can have a laugh about it. I'm in my mid 40s and I'm a manager at a FTSE 100 financial services company."
Every time I'm about to land in Berlin I can't help but say to myself 'Bombs away old chap - tally ho. I'm a Ryanair pilot. I know it's wrong but... fuck it.
I use a combination of VPN and private mode browsing to look at porn and read the Daily Mail. I don't want anyone to ever know I look at either.
When I am eating nice food as it gets towards the back of my throat I hack it back up to the front of my mouth so I can taste it all again. Repeat until there is more spit than food
I haven't bought a poppy in years. Every November I dig out the same old one and pin it to my jacket.
"When my dad was teaching me to drive, I hit our dog as I swung into our driveway too quickly. Dad told everyone it was him. Our dog was put to sleep a few weeks later and the guilt still haunts me. It's been over 12 years and I've never driven since and never will."
When my husband is reading a book I google the general plot points and find out the ending. Then I say smug things like 'oh you'll enjoy that' basically making out like I've read infinitely more books than him.

A mutual 'friend' has spent lockdown venting on social media about his step kids living with him full time. He adds regular updates about how many days it's been and how stupid/annoying they are and other abusive stuff. We contacted social services and shared the posts with them.
It really ticks me off when a barista remembers my usual coffee order and proudly rattles it off when I walk in. Makes me feel like I'd be letting them down if I fancy a change one day.
I like standing in small cupboards with the lights off. The smaller the better and I often do it when nobody is home. It gives me a sense of peace I don't get elsewhere.
Getting a car with cruise control has been a game changer. Now possible to liven up boring motorway journeys by removing a sock and then having a wank

"I once wandered around a Cornish seaside resort rubbing out the bottom part of the letter 'B' on pub & restaurant chalkboards so that they read, 'CRAP SANDWICHES', 'CRAP SALAD' or 'FRESH CRAP'. Pathetic I know."
At Uni I used to go to McDonalds 2/3 times a week and pretend to forget that breakfast ends at 10am just so I could eat a big Mac for breakfast. I'd make such a song and dance over it.
"When I was little, My Dad explained that the green 'P' plates on cars meant that the driver had just passed their test. I was 20 when I realised he meant that they'd recently passed, not that the P is a warning that they're reckless drivers who were a whisker away from failing."
When I had my daughter I was really looking forward to playing with dolls and dressing up with her but unfortunately she's into tractors and dinosaurs.
I'm a child portrait photographer. I'm known and respected in my industry. My child portraiture has won countless prestigeous awards. The truth is that I bloody hate kids. I only photograph them because parents will spend an insane amount of money.
For a minute after midnight every day for 4 years an entire website I built for a former employer switched all the fonts to Comic Sans MS. As far as I know they never found out. A bit tame I know but a little victory for me.
"The wax in my left ear smells terrible. However, the wax in my right ear smells rather lovely, sometimes I pick it just to sniff it. "
I do wonder if there's a medical reason for having nice smelling ear wax in 50% of my ears.
"If ever I need to purchase something from a local seller or hire a tradesperson, I'll find their Facebook profile and look at their liked pages. If they follow the Tories, Boris Johnson, Trump, or any pro-Leave account, I won't use them."

"Thank you David Gunner who sent us £5. The only one. Oh well, worth a go."
A friend got cancer. Died. Before he left he changed his linkedIn profile to employed by 'cancer'. Every year I get reminders to congratulate him on his work anniversary at 'cancer'. I'm totally going to do this when I get cancer.
"I have a rule that whenever I request or accept a new friend on Facebook, I have to delete an exiting one. Sometimes I delete two or three. It's a great way of getting rid of people you don't speak to anymore."

For a short time when I was a kid I was bullied by a local lad who not long afterwards developed an incurable disease and died. The paper ran a piece about how amazing and loved he was but the truth was he was a horrible cunt and I'm glad he died.
Every time I need to enter an email address anywhere to get free wi-fi I always use the personal email address of this prick I used to work with. It's been nearly a decade.
"Three years ago I did an explosive two-tone fart, and it sounded exactly like Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Sadly nobody else got to hear it, and I've been carrying this knowledge around ever since"
"My Mrs thinks I only smoke when I drink, but I secretly have one whenever she goes out, or whenever I walk the dog, or whenever I drive somewhere on my own. She smokes anyway so probably wouldn't care, but if it wasn't a secret I'd probably end up smoking full-time again."
I live in Sweden and i often invite people over for dinner. Smoked ham is a frequently used ingredient except it's not smoked ham- it's horse meat. I make them all eat horse. Arseholes.
"I still have my on-call work phone from my previous job. I constantly stream music with it & enter at least £10 of text competitions per week. I have zero guilt, they made me & over 1000 others redundant 2 years ago by closing our building as a cost-cutting exercise"
A family member's boyfriend has love you daddy as his text message tone from his two kids. It makes me sick. Just put the phone on silent you creep.
"My dad died whilst he was with a prostitute. I had to lie about where and how he'd died to everyone. Even now my whole family thinks he died on his own, in a parked car, because it was the first thing that came into my head."
When my Son was only about 2/3 I accidentally killed his pet goldfish. I didn't have the heart to tell him so I stuck a little goldfish sticker from the cbeebies magazine on the glass bowl and just moved it to a different position every couple of days.
Now that the hairdressers are open I don't actually want to get my hair cut.
Richard you're a absolute total prick and a coward - ghosting me instead of being honest!! You disgust me

"My partner never mutes the TV, just wastes 10 seconds of my life turning the volume to zero,then all the way back up again. The remote will exhibit A in the murder trial."

I don't pay for creme eggs I just steal them. I'm reasonably well off and I don't even really like them but I have this weird compulsion to take them because I feel they're overpriced.
Wife thinks all paint should be from Farrow&Ball sand chose all the colours and I've redecorated whole house whilst she's been living at work as I'm shielding. She loves the pictures I've sent and can't wait to see her designer house. Saved £400 on paint by using Crown. Result
"I eat obscene amounts of bread, and then tell my outraged husband that it was the dog."
"My wife and I barely have sex anymore and when we do it feels forced, it's almost like she's doing me a favour and doesn't really want to do it. I've no intention of cheating. Till death do us part and all that. Just really sad about it."
"While making breakfast, I strut around the kitchen singing a song that I've made up, to the tune of Do They Know It's Christmas? Sample lyrics: And in our world of plenty, we can spread a bit of jam, Pour the muesli in the bowl, at breakfast time."
I find wanking to my own imagination impossible to do since pornhub.
"About 5 years ago, I told a friend that the cottage cheese that she was eating on her baked potato looked a bit like thrush. She stopped eating it and put her lunch in the bin. Been carrying this guilt ever since."
"I'm divorced, and my child lives with me, she'd go to her father's every other weekend. Since lockdown she spends every other week with him and I love the time alone, and I look forward to her going away. I do love my child but I also find her a little bit boring."
I work with a Neal. Always call him Neil in emails as I know it winds him up.
I'm 38 and still don't know how to use a semicolon:
When I was 15 I did a collection for the striking Kent miners at a Labour Party meeting and forgot about it. I found it a few weeks later and spent the £14 on a fake leather skirt from TopShop. I'm a committed socialist and I still think about it.
"When Johnson was Mayor of London, I farted against his leg on a packed train from London Bridge to East Croydon. I was so mute with suppressed rage it was the only thing I could think to do."
My doctor prescribes me really strong cocodamol for the pain caused by a musculoskeletal condition. They do absolutely nothing to ease my pain but I tell the doctor that they do coz I fucking love that warm codeine buzz.
"As a teen, my favourite wanking pastime was posing my sister's Barbies into deprived orgies with my Action Men. Barbie regularly took on three marines at once. She loved it."
"I always manage to get more chippy chips than I should. They way I do it is to ask for a small portion but when they're about to hand it over I say actually, make it a large. That way they have to top it up by at least, if not more than, the proportionate difference price-wise."
"I go to charity shops and look through the blu rays for a digital copy code in the case. If there is one, I secretly take a photo and redeem the film for free. Most times they work. I have a nice movie collection from this."
"I earn a good wage but cannot resist checking EVERY discarded McD's hot drinks cup for stickers, I'll root through bins, in public, to get the goods. There are a lot less of them in COVID lockdown. So are more precious than ever."

"I speak to my ex on dating sites as different people & arrange a meet, just so I can go along and watch him being stood up & laugh! He's still not figured out why I'm always there to witness his humiliation........mug!!!!"
My husband always stays up a couple of hours after I go to bed. I know he's doing it so he can sneak in a wank after I'm asleep. As punishment I hide his pyjamas somewhere different every night so he can't find them when he creeps into our room by the light of his phone.
"I built myself a pub shed to enjoy lovely days in the garden and cheeky drinks with the wife when the kids go to bed, but really I've just been using it as my own personal cabin for carrying out my secret cocaine habit"

Sister phoned a sickie for me and exaggerated - said I'd fell down an embankment and was rushed to hospital by ambulance! Had to get really drunk and get a hard neighbour to batter me so I could get a sick line. Dr signed me off with severe facial injuries for 8 weeks..

I cut my pizza before putting it in the oven.
I have a very minor level of fame and for years I'd been waiting for a Twitter blue tick. In the end I decided to create 'impersonation' accounts and I'd complain to Twitter about it. Now I've got my distinguishing blue tick.
"I always say thank you to the washing machine when its done its job for me, same to the car."
"I used the maps feature on Snapchat to report drug use and people filming themselves while driving cars. I never contribute anything, just love to know that they'll get some form of warning on their account."

"If I make a tea then find out the milk is out of date, I always pull the exact same expression and look out to the middle distance like I'm in The Office. I was once caught and they thought it was a joke for them but really it's just something to amuse myself"
"To feel less guilty, I always donate 50p to charity whenever I pirate a film - it's how much the dvd would cost if I'd gone to a charity shop..."

I sometimes put food waste in the general waste bin when my wife's not looking.
I can't stop having sex dreams about Frank Gallagher from Shameless. Worse still he rejects me in all of them.

"Guinness is ok, but I used to pretend to like it because I'm a lightweight and it was the only 4% pint you could nurse and not get judged by my peer group"
"I was on a dating app. Was scrolling through thinking how do I get started on this thing. I saw a profile of someone who had made a mistake on their height. So I thought, great ice-breaker and messaged him taking the piss. Turns out he is actually a midget and I'm on a warning."
"My Boss added me to his mad golf mates What's app group. He promised great Bantz he lied, I want to mute the group but he quizzes me on it every morning. I'm thinking about leaving my job or breaking my phone."
Over 2 years ago me and a few mates set up a Star Wars dead pool. The guy who had Chewbacca didn't claim his winnings and the rest of us agreed to keep quiet so we didn't have to pay him a fiver each. He follows this account so if he doesn't claim it now he's a fucking moro...

My idiot sister called her baby boy Ira. I tried to talk her out of it. I don't hold grievances against Irish republicans but we live in an area affected by a bombing in the 80s and it's a very Brexity place. The kid is a teen now and gets bullied over his name
I find the sections that people repeatedly highlight in Kindle books so annoyingly vacuous that I take great pleasure in occasionally highlighting the dullest phrases I can find.
"I think Boris Johnson is a cunt. As is every member of his cabinet, and his senior advisor, Dominic Cummings. Actually, I don't know why I'm saying this anonymously, frankly - it's fairly obvious."
"I lived in a flat with a shared hallway. My mag subscrip started going missing. I figured that the guy downstairs son was nicking it coz there were sexy girls on the cover of the mag. I asked him, he looked guilty af but denied everything. So I pushed pins into tires of his bike"

"Many years ago I was the overnight runner at ITN. One night, me and another runner snuck into the studio, turned the cameras around to face the rear wall and racked up and snorted a couple of fat lines from Sir Trevor McDonald's News At Ten desk."
"Used to work in a hotel bar. I'd harvest customers' half-empty bottles of mixers from tables, combine them, loosely re-cap them and put them back on the shelf. Then I'd sell them again, and pocket the cash. Think of it as recycling."
I work in Mark François' constituency office and know how much inserting a cedilla accent on his surname annoys him. I've also had it added to the autocorrect dictionary of all the computers in the office.
"I never take annual leave over Christmas. There's never any work happening, so why waste it? This tactic bumps my annual leave up to 32 days. Whoopee!"
I look away when a pretty woman walks past me. Don't want to give her the satisfaction.
"My other half has an intense phobia of sharing drinks, to the point if he knows you've had a sip, he will chuck the drink away and meticulously clean the bottle/cup. So as a little game to my self everytime he's out the room and leaves his drink, I'll take a tiny sip"
I like to get a malt loaf and squeeze it into a turd shape and leave it on the toilet seat/ in the toilet for people to find in horror. Makes a great unflushable log to knock everyone in the office sick
When getting petrol I have to round up to the nearest pound. If I go a penny over I go the next pound which on occasions costs me a lot more money. Imagine my horror when I fail to do this and fill the tank to a random amount like £73.67
"My wife is coeliac, anything with gluten is essentially poisonous to her. Whenever I'm pissed off at her I make myself feel better with some KFC, her favourite food she can no longer eat."
"In the 80s I met Joni Mitchell at a party. I was only 18, I'd never heard her music & I didn't know who she was. I was rude to her and refused to share my joint with her. Even now, more than 30 years later, I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night and hate myself."
I preferred life when I was completely ignorant of my own white male privilege. I just thought I was really good at stuff.
I have a slightly strange obsession with plucking the little hairs that grow on the outside of my ear holes. So satisfying to evict one of the little buggers!
"As a newsagent in late 90s, used to cut tops off Sn & Daily Heil where the date was, & dump the papers in the recycling bins. Tops were then sent back to distributors to claim full credit for unsold copies. Gradually they sent less & less till they stopped sending altogether"

"I found one of those Please offer me a seat badges on the floor at a tube station. Before lockdown, I often wore it during rush hour commutes when I couldn't be bothered to stand. I'm a perfectly healthy 26 year old."
My wife insists on making dog-with-a-bone noises when giving fellatio. No fucking idea why. I don't say anything as I'm just happy to get them in the first place. Having your cock licked goes out the window a month into most relationships.
"I Always go on daily walks without my wife. I tell her being alone helps me clear my mind and improve my mental health. In reality, I'm playing Pokemon Go for an hour"
"I made a no-budget film with the hero based on me. My friends thought he was a horrible sociopath, so I had to pretend it was a satire."
My company's social distancing and face mask rules make it much easier to hide my alcoholism from my team. I hope this pandemic lasts a long time.

Im the only one in my family who knows why my dad has high blood pressure. I once found him with his other 70 year old mates doing lines of coke in the side room of a 500 year old temple. We've never discussed it.
The first time I ate king prawns I didn't realise I had to take the shell off. I said to the person I was with in the restaurant that I enjoyed the crunch.
I stole a work colleagues favourite spoon. Every morning he'd arrive AT work THEN go to the kitchen to make his porridge.He used the same spoon every day. On my last day I stole said spoon and took it home with me. It's still in my kitchen drawer. I don't use it but nether can he

I once keyed the entire length of a hummer that was parked on the sidewalk

I've been using the Oxford comma since I learned about it 10 years ago so that I can 'educate' whomever tries to correct me for the extra comma. No one has yet but I still use it in hope. I'm a 50 year old man.
Years ago on a work night out a colleague once discussed how his mother died eating KFC. Ever since I've been petrified eating KFC that a bone will get lodged in my throat which will result in my death. Chicken Tuesday buckets for £5.99 are delightful though. Well worth the r...

"Years ago, I told a now well known comedian and tv presenter that he was absolute shit and to give up, to his face. He was just starting out at the time and I still feel bad about it as it was quite obviously hurtful to him. Still don't find him funny though."
"I believe in soulmates... unfortunately my husband isn't mine, my ex-boyfriend is... and its kills me everyday"

I still sometimes listen to Lostprophets. It wracks me with guilt but some of their songs mean so much to me and helped me through a difficult time in my young-adulthood. I can't give them up completely.
My long term mistress and I sometimes visit sex clubs. Together we've had sex with many strangers in various ways. It's great! My wife knows nothing & I think it's saved my marriage.

"As a motoring journalist, I occasionally get asked for car buying advice. If I don't like the person, I recommend the truly wretched Ford EcoSport SUV. I regret nothing and have no trouble sleeping at night."

My dad has dementia and I don't see the point in spending time with him because he can't retain any of it. In a way he's already dead.
I really like The Big Bang Theory but I'm too embarrassed to watch it of my own accord. I have to wait until it comes on E4 and pretend I'm watching it because nothing else is on.
"I'm head over heels infatuated with Gary Barlow. To the point where whenever I have sex, I imagine it's him to make it better. I regularly zone out in class with sex fantasies over him."
I'm an academic in my 50s with an interest in human origins; also a vegetarian. I've taken up running during lockdown. When I'm on a long run I imagine I'm a Paleolithic hunter chasing down faster prey to exhaustion because it's incapable of sweating. It's fucking awesome.
The girl who works in the local Italian deli is so ridiculously attractive I can't go in there any more because I feel like a gargoyle by comparison.
"Was always curious about being dominated but my wife wasn't. Have been watching a lot of pegging porn through a bedroom drought. We're now making more of an effort but vanilla sex just doesn't cut it anymore. Can't explain why to her, that would mean admitting to all the porn"

Whenever I see anyone in Help for Heroes clobber I engage them in conversation and see if I can get them to say something racist. They always do.

"My wife nags me to make her toast before she goes to bed, I tax her by taking a sliver out the middle when I cut it. The more nagging, the bigger the sliver."

When my daughter was about 4 years old I used to let her swear into a plastic cup that was used to wash hair with in the bath. We called it the Swearing Cup. It amused me no end and she almost always said the C word.

I turn the kettle off just before it boils. The water is still perfectly hot and I like to feel in control.
There's this guy in our office who is convinced he can make convincing cat noises. He seems so lonely. Whenever he makes his cat noise - more akin to a tortured bagpipe - we all turn around to make him feel better. It seems to be the only thing keeping him going after his wife...

I could never pull a wheelie on my bike and it still fucks me off. Why am I so shit at it ?
My wife is my everything. It cuts me to peices when she says she only stays with me as we can't afford to live separately. She's also started to refer to things as her kids/bedroom/house like I don't exist anymore in her mind

"I pretend I'm in love with someone else and he pretends to be in love with me and we sigh and say how different it could be if we didn't have spouses but we both know if we were that bothered, we'd leave them and be together. It is a nice way to pass the time."

At school I would unpeel the metal tags inside book covers in the library and plant them deep in the bowels of my friend's backpacks so that the door alarm would go off every time they went through. Months of enjoyment ensued.
"From the second they wake up to the second they fall asleep my small children talk. All day. Every day. Talk, talk, talk. On and on and on. I love them and everything, but sometimes I think about killing myself just for some peace and quiet."

"I fucked 3 guys called Dave on the same day! One in the morning then, had a threesome with the other two in the evening!"
My ex and I had a magnificent book collection. When we broke up I let them have the lot because I couldn't bear to split them. So I did the next best thing and spent ages cutting out various last pages and substituting them for other last pages in books the same size.
"Before lockdown, my partner went to the gym four nights a week. Unknown to her, I'd cancelled the gym membership just before Christmas but she still 'went' most nights. She's the only person I know who's got fat 'going' to the gym & that's what her affair did for her..."
I eat peanuts by poring them into a bowl and using a spoon.
My LinkedIn says I'm a media relations expert but I know fuck all about the media. I just throw stuff out there and say what I like to journalists and hope for the best.

"7 years ago I found a wallet with £548.73 in cash & cards. Used the name on the card to return to the owner, who was a Count & owned a children's soft play. Yrs later, when I had kids, my wife visited & told him the story. He gave no discount! Wish I kept the cash, tight prick!"
"I was walking home from work one morning whilst smoking, it was summer and we were due a dry hot day. I threw my fag flippantly down an alleyway. Next morn I was walking home, a random garden in the alleyway was completely burned down, shed & everything. I think that was me."
"I'm a guy. At university, I was once in a room with 3 female friends, A, B and C. I solemnly looked at A at one point and made a promise to myself that I would kiss her. The following week I snogged B, and ended up marrying C. We've been married 20 years."

My girlfriend has quite a big forehead. When I lie next to her in bed I can't help but thinking how far she could head a football
"A guy at work and I both know we have 'something' there even though we're both happily married. When we both have to take a long flight together for work, the first of us to book our seat casually mentions the seat number in open plan. The other always books the adjacent seat."
I did my masters in cancer research. I didn't have the results for an experiment so I just made them up. More scientists do this than you'd like to think...

"When I was a teenager I learned that if I squeezed my sperm pipe at the magic moment, it stopped my hot fuzz coming out and saved me the hassle of cleaning up. I did it for years and it's probably made the infertile now as my ejaculate is lumpier than frogspawn."
"Dear Mr. Roeder, it was me who stole your bag and took a shit in it in 7th grade. Not sorry."
My big brother had a magazine called The Unexplained. The 1st edition came with a flexi-disc called Voices of the Dead. I was so terrified I bent it up and hid it behind his drawers. He never found it

Whenever I see Benjamin Netanyahu written down I feel the urge say Net-en-YA-HOO! in the style of the jingle for the late 90s internet giant.
In my experimental teenage years I fingered my arse with 3 fingers and the help of a generous lathering of Vaseline. Felt more like a science experiment than a sexual endeavour. Really regretted telling my mates.
"When Michael Jackson died I didn't feel especially sad, but rather disappointed because I'd always thought it'd be fascinating to see how his face would morph or possibly even melt as he turned into an old man."
I am a married mother in early 40s and I have thought about Keir Starmer's penis every day for about 3 weeks. To be clear...I think about it in its erect form and I imagine it to have a wide girth and 8 inches or so of length
Since lockdown I've discovered that all the duties of my quite senior job can be condensed into 45 minutes a day.
"Every day on my daily walk I go to the Co-op, buy two Turkish Delights for a quid, and eat them before I get home. Nothing for my partner."
"My roommate has a very sweet dog and, because we work different hours, I take care of the dog when she is at work. Whenever I'm alone at home with the dog I go out of my way to make the dog like me more than her because I don't think she looks after her dog well enough."
"If I use google maps for walking to a place, I invariably walk in the opposite direction, I can never quite work out the North, South, East and west instructions."
"Boys' secondary in the early 80s, we weren't allowed to wear underwear for PE/Games. Indoor kit was a white vest and nylon shorts. Aged 14/15 the combination of exertion and friction gave me an erection. Everybody noticed, even the teacher. 40 years later I still cringe."
When I see someone with veneers I just imagine the freaky little nubs underneath
"Although it was the right decision, I was still sad when my marriage ended. I often dream my ex lives with me & my son & we are all happy. When I wake up I hug my new partner with my eyes closed pretending she is my ex & that my sons family is still together. Then I feel guilty."
"When driving I sometimes put Tonight from West Side Story on and belt it out, reliving my school's 1988 inter-house choir competition. I picture the judges, the audience cheering, lifting the trophy, the lot. We were runners up but fuck it. We deserved to win so this way we do."
When working in a call centre I would change the horrible customers names on their accounts to Mr or Mrs Twat.

I used to retouch famous faces for a very well known make up company's global advertising campaigns. Often I would write obscenities at minute scale and hide them in the pictures. I once wrote the C word on a very famous English models top lip.
I regret having children.
"I have an A5 piece of card behind my drawers next to my bed. Any treasure from nasal digging gets stuck to it. The one side of the card is nearly completely covered, like a bogey mosaic."
"As a kid I was obsessed with the first Highlander film, so much so I convinced my parents to buy me a sheep skin rug to sleep with to make me more Scottish."
Was pleased when an old friend contacted me out of the blue. He did so to make a deep and sincere apology for his apparent insults and bullying towards me. I have no memory of this at all. I lied and told him his apology meant a great deal to me and set my mind at ease.
"When I was a young lad of 10, I found my mum's pantyliners. The instructions said tear off strip, and press to close fitting pants. I thought they were padding you used if your trousers were a little tight around the waist. I wore one for a day. I've never told anyone this."
I recently found a website that shows MoT history for cars. I often search the registrations of cars that I no longer own to see how much grief they're causing the next owner.
"I met a woman at a goth club in London. I was 19, drunk and full of myself, and when she said her name was Esther, I said, Like Esther Rantzen and walked off. Regretted it ever since. Wish I'd been nice. Maybe I wouldn't be enduring lockdown and Brexit alone. Sorry Esther."
"I was once late for a funeral service so snuck into the back of the church, no seats so I stood up and rested on the wall with my shoulder. After a short while, I slid a little bit on the wall and turned the entire lights out for the church."
"I'm a 45 year old woman with reasonable skin but if the 50 year olds and their selfies are anything to go by, I'm going to literally shrivel over the next 5 years. Absolutely shitting it, my face is all I have."
"I'm female and when I'm horny I get angry if I don't get seen to. Wanking is good, but it's just not the same."
If it's wasn't for my family I would withdraw from the world completely. Choose 1000 books and 1000 movies to see me through. Maybe a few puzzles. Had enough of absolutely everything.
"Always cruise on the motorway at 69mph , not for safety it just makes me smile looking at the speedometer"
"Every time a new website opens and looks like it might be even a little bit popular, I run a bot to register dozens of account names I think will be popular. I don't intend to sell them or anything I just like being a nuisance 🤷‍♂️"
"My OH had a 'thing' with a girl in America when he was 18, his 1st tattoo was her name across his back. When I came into the picture, I got jealous as I saw they were still friends on FB so I went on his acc+ blocked her+then unblocked, leaving him thinking that she deleted..."
"I've spent my entire life telling people I am profoundly allergic to cats when in fact I have no such allergy, I just hate being anywhere near the filthy things. The thought of a cat shitting in a litter tray and then walking on a kitchen surface makes me want to vomit."

"I really don't like my missus at times & often think about just walking out & never returning. However, she's the owner & director of a business worth several million big ones. Her parents are worth about £2m also - of which she'll inherit half of it. Me? I'm just a van driver."
"As a teen I wrote a letter to a neighbor girl about I had a crush on her. She came over and asked to go for a walk. We got to her house, she asked if I want watch a movie. I thought she meant for me to watch alone, I said no and left, she never spoke to me again."
"I've been married for a number of years and love my wife dearly, but I can't stand her kids as they talk to her like shit all the time and it tears me apart because she doesn't deserve it, but won't say anything to them, and they don't listen to me as I'm not their dad."
As kids we collected a load of dog shit and filled all eighteen holes of the local golf course with it one night. I regret nothing.
I once urinated on a mosque. I was caught short on way home from pub and went in an alleyway and only realised after the deed. I'm actually not remotely islamophobic. Forgive me.
When I was 19 I had drunken sex with my friend's mum. 9 months later she gave birth to twin boys. She was 99.9% sure I was the father. I'm now 53 and the 2 boys are the spit of the young me. They don't even know I exist. It kills me when I see them now with families of their own.
"No matter what tv channel I'm watching, I always put it back to BBC1 before I switch off and go to bed"
"Every single thing I've ever posted on Twitter or Facebook has been a coded cry for help, one way or another. But I try to make them witty, so people laugh. But if they notice, and try to help, I feel I have failed, and I laugh it off. This has been going on for years."

I had an affair with a married man I met online who I suspected gave me a fake name. As he showered I checked his wallet. 8 months later he ghosts me. So Hello Simon/Steven I've known for 2 years & I found yours Mrs on FB. I promised I'd not ruin your life and I never will x
I used to drink water that collected in yogurt pots in the dishwasher trying to become ill and avoid school/college. Never worked.

I don't know if it's Duck Tape or Duct Tape and I'm too old to ask
"I killed a bee. Found it crawling on the carpet, picked it up and made some sugar water for it. Made too much and it fell in. Good intentions but still feel really bad."

"I spent my 20s & 30s epicly slutting it up & working as a sex worker. Now I'm 47 & married to an amazing guy who knows abt my past & adores me. Girls, listen to aunty: sluttiness doesn't make it harder to find love, but it does efficiently cull losers who aren't worth yr time xx"

I'm not exactly famous but I do have my own Wikipedia page. Once every couple of months I check up on it and edit in nonsense - at the moment it says I'm allegedly Mick Jagger's unrecognised son from an Inuit woman.
I have a habit of emailing companies with adverts I don't like to let them know I won't be buying their product.
I've pretended for years that I've got kids. Just so I can take the piss and take off work at a drop of a hat.
Won a longest amyl nitrate sniff competition as a teen. My prize was a convulsion on a shopping centre floor.
Walking home after heavy snow I wrote LSD using my footprints on the front lawn of every house to reflect what was going on in my brain
I opened a neighbours mail from the DWP and found out she was claiming to be a single parent family of 4. Actually she has only 2 children and lives with her partner who is also her landlord. Shopped them both. They have to pay back 8k. Not a bit guilty.
"Some guy on Reddit started messaging me asking for foot photos in return for Amazon vouchers. Obviously I'm sending him them, might as well make a few quid out of my girly looking feet, just wish I didn't have to keep shaving my legs."
"I'm a grown up who has never routinely taken exercise. Now I'm desperate to get on a bike or to go for a run, but I am very self conscious about starting doing something new. I bought some running trainers yesterday."
Worked with a guy who was very diligent with his to do lists. I could copy his handwriting and used to add things like take up smoking and birthday card for Lucy. He had a month off with stress and I think I might have been responsible.
I had a beautiful London city scape painting on reserve for me to buy for £7k. The artist was Rolf Harris. He got charged two days before I was due to pay. Needless to say I cancelled. Bet they couldn't give it away after that!
To encourage agreement between our kids when choosing a family film we did a secret ballot and I pretended Labyrinth - 80s Bowie - had won. We watched it and the whole way through they blamed each other for the utter shite we had to endure.
"Mountain biking about 18 years ago, I mounted the pavement on the Leeds Ring Road at Weetwood Lane and very nearly hit Jimmy Savile who was out jogging. If I'd killed him then, I'd have been country's most hated woman. For about 3 days until I became a national hero."
I always order steak rare because I think it's sophisticated but I don't really like it

"Late 90s, one night my brother, a cousin & I created a massive crop circle in Cornwall, using planks and rope. It took 4hrs but was worth it. It appeared in national papers but the 3 of us swore never to reveal ourselves. I can confess it here anonymously!"
"The suction on our hoover is a lot stronger than I anticipated when I stuck my cock in it. Less of a blowjob experience, more of a few frantic seconds thinking it was going to rip it right off."
"If it wasn't for the nagging, there'd be pretty much zero conversation in our household. So on a weird level, i'm kind of thankful for it."

31st August 1997 I was having a wank and the news came on the TV that Princess Diana had died. Now every time I wank I think of her. Only for a split second some times. But every time guaranteed.
I don't use bog roll. I wipe my arse with baby wipes. You're not supposed to put them down the toilet but the cleanliness and hygiene of my hoop is far more important than the stupid environment.
I block every promoted tweet. Fuck them.
"When I started work at the building society, I earned £9,800 a year. I felt like I needed a holiday so I stayed late and stole some colour toner cartridges from stationary supplies and sold them for over £100 each on eBay. I was worried about it on holiday but no one noticed."
"I don't think I'm depressed, but I just can't find a point to my life. What is the point in ANYTHING? Protests, Online Influencers, watching the telly, going to work... It's fucking useless. We're going to die anyway, so why bother?"
"If you park on the pavement, I'm walking into your wing-mirror."
Always hated Ofsted. Bullshitted my way into working for them full time. It's easy and spend my days drinking tea and on the internet. The reports I write are heavily dependent on the quality of biscuits and whether or not the headteacher is a dick. Know for a fact I'm not alone
"I once sat on a train opposite a young stripy-shirted banker who had irritated me with his loud phonecalls. He went to sleep. I wrote in his diary on a random page, Tuesday: fuck a badger."
"I'm a postman. When I walk past a house that has no mail and someone from that house sees me and says, oh good, no bills then it makes me want tear their fucking heads off. It happens at least 10 times a day. It's not funny anymore."
For over 10 years I've been writing letters to agony aunts about imaginary and highly improbable troubles. Fave one - though far from most outrageous - was when the Guardian printed my letter where I pretended to be a woman whose husband makes her wear celebrity masks during sex.
"Someone once used my surname as my name in an email, six months ago. Still angry."
"My parents are divorced.My remain voting dad is now posting All Lives Matter bullshit, and my Brexit voting mum is posting Black Lives Matter stuff. I now don't know whose doorstep to shit on every few weeks."

When I was 11 I knew that men's penises could get erect but didn't understand how. So I rationalised that each man had 2 penises - a stiff one and a soft one. The one not in use would be kept in the fridge in lidded Tupperware. Somehow.
I always give a fake name whenever I get a coffee at Starbucks. They're getting more and more outlandish. 'Anakin' was the last one
I often pass off stuff I have read on Fesshole as anecdotes of my own in an attempt to disguise the empty banality that is my life.
When someone dies I always try to find their social media accounts for the poignancy. Did they know their last picture/tweet was their last?

"In the 90's I bought a brand new car on finance; and 3 years later opted out and returned it; still with over £10k left to pay on it. Knowing how the system worked for these, I then offered to drive the car to the local auction; where a day later I bought it back for £2500."
"Not me, but my dad. When we first got the phone connected in the 1970's we were given a number that had once belonged to a pizza joint. Drunks would call late at night ordering pizza. Rather than explain, dad pretended to take the order and tell them to pick it up in 20 minutes."

"For years I didn't understand North, South, East and West. Regardless of where I was facing I thought North was in front of me, South behind, East to my right and West to my left."

I worked for Rupert Murdoch for nearly 20 years.
I worked with a BNP member and council elections candidate. I didn't have the nerve to challenge his views to his face but for 2 years I regularly pissed in his coffee.

I got 4 tickets for Michael Jackson's last tour. Me and the gf took two and I sold the other two on eBay. When MJ died I never refunded for the eBay tickets. Still feel guilty about it now even though it was over 10 years ago.
"I'm a straight guy, married with kids, never done anything gay before. When I shower I like to squirt shampoo or conditioner in my face and look at myself in the mirror. I get off imagining I've been bukakeed by a group of straight mates."

I'm a journalist and have a lot of numbers saved in my phone. Phone went mad once and got stuck speed dialling Alastair Campbell
"My wife & I have 2 toy monkeys that we treat and dress like children. They have developed their own unique personalities and they occupy space in our psyches like real people. So much so that if we ever lost either of them we'd be devastated. I'm in my mid 50's, she's mid 40's."
"Loving the fact that drug dealers still operating all through lockdown, got me through this, in fact Saturday night was epic!"
Years ago I had a short-lived affair with a married woman in my office. She had beautiful red hair and an astonishing body. Over 20 years later and my most Googled search term is: big tits redhead.

Life is immeasurably better since I started driving to work and the extra cost is absolutely worth it. Takes about the same time door-to-door but I'm in my own space and can travel whenever I want. I'm no longer exhausted and actually look forward to my commute. Joy.
"I get up at 5am on weekdays but unlike other early risers, I don't feel the need to mention it all the time because I'm not a cunt who thinks it marks me out as superior"
"Imagine my utter disappointment and dismay as an 8 year old when I was taken to see the Elgin Marbles and discovered they were classical Greek sculptures and not supersized, special marbles to play with."
I seriously regret ever having children. I would be a lot happier if it was just me and my husband - but here we are 3 kids later.
"I got 9 As in my GCSEs but one F - in RE - because I absolutely fucking hated that indoctrinating bollocks subject - and spent one entire exam paper writing a spoof biopic of Jorge McFuckytaps, the zany half-Portuguese half-Scottish inventor of the celebrity rectum simulator."

It wasn't until I was at university that I learned vagina was not spelt fagina.

Whenever my friends discuss how sandwiches should be cut I always go with the flow and say rectangles. When I am on my own I always cut them diagonal because that what I prefer. If I have to cut a sandwich into rectangles because I am in company I angrily resent it.
"Whenever the missus asks me to make a gin and tonic, I pour equal measures, then take a massive swig from the bottle. Only way to cope with her bullshit and my misery."
"I have stolen a cat. It spends all day every day in my house making my kids feel like I have finally let them have their own pet, only returning to its own home to shit and feed. All it costs me is a saucer of milk in the morning & evening. Actually maybe I have bribed a cat."

"The mother-in-law died at home last week, after a long illness. Before my husband took all her unused prescriptions back to the chemist I skimmed off all the good bits. Have just snorted a vial of morphine before dinner & there's tranquillisers for later. I don't feel bad."
"I quit smoking 11 years ago when I had a heart attack. However, on every anniversary of it, I buy a 20 pack and smoke them over the course of a week. I mask the smell from my wife with mint humbugs."
Sometimes I delay feeding my cats for a couple of hours so they love me and give me attention.
"I sometimes turn the kettle off seconds before it actually ends as I can't be bothered to wait but then when I make a cuppa, I always worry if I have ruined it by not letting it boil those couple of extra seconds."

My daughter's horse is an absolute money pit and I hope it dies or she loses interest soon

I've never really fancied the person I am married to but he is a great person to share my life with and we have a wonderful time. Also he is rich so I don't have to work and I relish this every weekday morning when I roll over in bed and don't have to get up. I love him.
I like Ribena and Milk. Wife is appalled by this
I can't eat ice lollies in front of family members. According to my partner the technique is very similar to a blow job.

"Before uni, I went to my future uni town to 'find a part-time job'. Spend the day in the pub, came home & told my parents I'd got a job at Boots. For the next 4 years every time they visited I pretended I worked at Boots. Never set foot in the place."
About 3 years ago I had to have fairly major surgery with all signs pointing at cancer. Post Op biopsy gave me the all clear. Not long after my mum was diagnosed with cancer and died 18 months ago. Everyday I think that she made a deal for me to be fine & for her to take my place
"Sometimes I buy a pint of whole prawns at the seaside and share them with my cat at home. We have a 'one for me, one for you' dinner, but often she eats them slower than me and I have an extra one and feel guilty."
I've recently changed roles at work and the stuff I'm supposed to do barely takes up a third of my day. I honestly don't know if I'm supposed to be doing other things but my SimCity has never looked better.
I always hold my phone up to my ears when I'm singing/rapping along to song while driving. I'd rather have passersby think I'm in a full blown argument than know I'm singing. It eliminates the cringy feeling of being seen
"One time as a teenager I got excited when my parents said they were headed to bed, but instead they ended up watching an incredibly dry BBC4 documentary about Bob Monkhouse, thus delaying my wank by an hour. For this reason, I've always resented Bob Monkhouse."

When I got my latest smartphone that was water resistant. The first thing I did was take about 20 pictures of my cock and balls underwater in the bath.
I had an acrimonious split from a business partner in which I was fucked over. Every month he gets a new delivery to the office. Each box has something more offensive written on it. Stuart's porn. Stuart's gay porn. Stuart's scat kit. Stuart's nonce club is my favourite.
Once found a cache of Hermes 'missed you delivery calling cards' I'd fill them in with 'left in bin' and post though neighbours doors night before bin night. Wake up early to watch the chaos next day with the bin men
"When using zebra crossings, I slow down a bit to make the cars wait longer."
"I used to think Spongebob didn't belong in the Spongebob universe, because he was the only man-made object. Then I learned about sea sponges."

"When I was single I used to be in the swinging scene, but since meeting my girlfriend she is totally against it. God I just yearn for orgies and shagging other people's wives"
When my wife and I started dating she dared me to wear her underwear out for a meal so me being me I did it. However we ended up drunk in a pub doing karaoke where I sang The Thong Song whist dancing provocatively. It mortifies me to this day

I really like peeling long strips of skin off the heels of my feet and eating them. They're chewy. I'm thinking about frying them to see if they come out like pork scratchings.
I once walked into a museum late one evening. The lady at the front desk was sobbing inconsolably. I asked her if the museum was still open for visitors. She said no. I turned around & walked out.Didn't ask her if she needed any help or offered any support. I still regret it.
Did a poo today that perfectly resembled a cock and balls - I have peaked
"I worked for one of the UK's biggest football clubs. If you got a signed ball from the club or won one in a raffle in the early 90s, there's about an 80 per cent chance all the autographs were done by one fringe player who could forge all the others' signatures."
"I collect those little plastic charity-slots discs they give you in supermarkets. They give me them at checkout & I resent being socially pressured to give, so I pocket them & walk out. Hot tip - they work in the shopping trolley pound slots!"
"I named my first daughter after someone at work. My wife thought it was because I liked the name, but really it was because I fancied her like mad."
"When I was a kid, I used to make myself breathe really slowly because I once read in a book that someone 'had taken their last breath'. I thought everyone had a finite number of breaths after that."
I hide my weekly McDonalds in a Sainsburys bag for life so my neighbours don't judge me.
"I sometimes tap the ends of my tweezers together, pretending I'm the morse code operator on the Titanic."
I went to a house party despite having acute diarrhea. Left early because I needed to go but got caught short on the walk home. Ran into the nearest bit of cover I could and exploded on wall of the building. I then realised it was a church. I wonder if it was deemed a hate crime.
"Sometimes, when I'm bored, I like to go to busy car parks and leave notes on several cars that read Sorry for the damage and watch as they start inspecting their car."

 #thedishwasher
My dad was adopted. His birth mum had him when she was 13. She made contact when she was dying. They both lived in the same town. Turns out he has a half sister and when he turned 50 he invited her to his party. I recognised her straight away. I fucked her 4 years ago.
My boss told me proudly how he would vote Tory at the last election so he didn't have to pay more tax. Their incompetence and corruption is now ruining his business. This makes me smile whenever I think about it.
"Pretty much all my music came from one person, who ended up abusing me. Because of this, I can now only listen to the ten songs I already had beforehand, plus the shrek soundtrack. If this gets published, can y'all reply with cheerful songs?"
"I always like social media posts that are a single like away from 100's, 1000's etc. Even if I completely disagree with what's shared. I think I might have OCD"
I use fly paper in the summer months. Hours of pleasure watching the little fuckers try to get off it again
"I sometimes jerk off watching boxing, MMA etc. Not because I'm gay but because there are always women in the crowd really getting off on the testosterone and violence. It's really sexy. I've also frequently roared 'The Notorious!' as I spray my telly. I clean it off don't worry."
I recently used the Faceapp app to see what I would look like as a woman. Then I had a crafty w@nk over the picture as I looked surprisingly fit. It's left me very confused about my sexuality.
"I'm absolutely delighted to have been diagnosed as perimenopausal, because now doctors will stop patronising me about how I might change my mind about not wanting kids. The end is in sight!"
"The wife and I have spent this year's holiday money on a Summer House out the back. We both know it's to spend time apart, as we plan the inevitable separation when all this is over. I like it down here."
"Every Sunday I make a roast dinner for my family. They're often left somewhat disappointed that there's no stuffing. I tell them that I've forgot, but I haven't. I make the stuffing and love to eat it raw whilst slurping on pre-dinner drinks. I'm not even sorry."
I purposely drive through puddles to Soak and annoy pedestrians
I push the buttons on pedestrian crossings even if there's nothing coming for a while. I like that it looks like the cars are stopping for a ghost.
I once stole a packet of £1 fishing hooks from Woolworths in the early 80's. I still blame myself for them going into administration.
"When me and my wife have sex, we try to spice things up and challenge ourselves by playing the least erotic accompanying music we can think of. Last night it was the theme tune from Albert the Fifth Musketeer."
"A couple of years ago I did something really nice for someone but as I didn't film it and put it on social media, I'm not sure what the point was"
"I once pissed in a lift just to see what it would be like. Enjoyed it, would recommend"

I never wish anyone a happy birthday on social media because I neither care if it's your birthday or if it's happy. Fuck off.
For nostalgia I decided to have a harmless wee in the bath like when I was a kid. Imagine my horror when I unleashed a rancid luminous radioactive torrent which destroyed all the bubbles and turned the water a sinister Chernobyl green. So much for nostalgia.
"When I was 17, I once knowingly sold a broken, heavy, VHS player to an old man at a car boot sale"
Nestle go to all that trouble to make and shape Shredded Wheat but I undo it all by scrunching it up in the packet before putting it in the bowl.
I derive a peculiar pleasure from flicking my bogies into the recycling. I wonder what they have been re-manufactured into. Perhaps you have one or two of them in something you've bought recently.
I'd never had sex in a public so one day when I was single on holiday I went down to the beach at night. There was no one around and I just pulled my pants down to my ankles and masturbated to sound of the sea. The only lights were in the distance provided by Llandudno pier
I just can't find a jumpsuit that suits me
"Threw away sex toys and physical porn in case I die of Covid. Also clear my phone every night but can't go back years into e mails so just have to hope no one looks at those. Nothing illegal, just affairs that would sully my spouse's memory of me"
"I recently changed my Twitter name and photo to that of an average looking middle aged woman. I don't tweet any differently to how I did before, yet I seem to get more likes/retweets. I also get a lot more negative comments though."
I think it would have been a good thing if the COVID-19 death toll had been much higher.
I'm on a local village FB group. I spend time winding them up which means they appeal to the group owner/moderator. This morning I discovered there wasn't one so I appointed myself. Now have a great time kicking the arseholes off and approving fit new members.
"I'm so good at faking how I'm feeling. Everyone thinks i'm fine when really, I can't cope anymore, and i'm fed up of feeling anxious and crying myself to sleep"
"I hate couples who become overnight experts on parenting. My mate and his wife talk of the hardship of having a baby, any 'advice' they give us we do the opposite. Even if what they say is true we are going to say opposite, even if I'm really tired I'm going to say I'm not...."
"I like to buy courgettes and put a condom on them, then place them on the stairs in my block of flats. "
Concierge and the housing company are perplexed.
I regularly wee into a chamberpot during long video conferences. I do mute myself and turn video off first though - I'm not a monster.
I suck cheese. Like a mint.
I have a large guitar and amplifier collection. My biggest fear is that if I died my wife would sell them all based on what she thinks I paid for them.

Whenever I drive over a railway crossing I squeeze my shoulders in case a train comes and I need to just make it through the gap. I am 48.
"I fantasize about having a statue of Dominic Cummings put up, just so we can smash it. Am I losing my sanity here?"
"When I put air in the tyres on my car, I have a favourite one. Always have done. It's the back one on the drivers side. I always treat it better by giving it a bit more air than the other ones. No idea why."
"When I was 8, a 10 year old boy punched my 7 year old brother. I thought about it for a second then twatted his 6 year old brother. Made perfect sense at the time."
I've put a fair bit of weight on during the lockdown and secretly hope my boyfriend leaves me over it.
"I'm a married father of two infant children. One of my biggest fantasies is about how nice it would be to live on my own; what I'd do in the evenings after work & at weekends, how I'd decorate the house. I even think about how I'd use the kids' room."

I once won an iPad from a sticker off the front of fish food bottle. Thank goodness for 'no proof of purchase required' as it meant I could peel all the stickers off in the shop I worked in and enter them at home.
"Once when I was walking to primary school I saw a leaf on someone's hedge covered in some kind of insect eggs. I pulled it off the bush and ate it, thinking it would give me special powers. With some hindsight it's a wonder I didn't die or at least get the shits."
"Recently my firm has taken on lots of temporary staff, After interviews I immediately went on there FB profile and accepted/rejected them based on how attention seeking there status's are. A 'check in at Drs' and 'I'm so angry' type people went straight in the no pile."
"Whilst working from home, I put my status as busy on MS Teams and ignore my bosses calls"
"My mate's an estate agent. Once a year, he grossly undervalues a property, buys it then sells it for a huge profit. He claims this isn't even illegal."

I wish my husband would shag me more. I'm starting to resent his lack of sex drive and getting bored of wanking. There is only so much a rampant rabbit can do.
"I'm a fully-functioning alcoholic. Pre-lockdown, I'd spend £50-60 each day working from home ie pub. Since lockdown, I spend tops £15/day on 12 cans when I take dog for walk. Girlfriend suspicious why I have £1k+ spare end of each month, but fuck it, I'm a park drinker ..."

"I never wish anyone a happy birthday on FB. I just don't give a shit, you're not a child."

I've been vegan for 6 years but since lockdown I have developed a secret Jaffa cake addiction. I buy them whenever I can and eat them in the car or when my husband goes walking the dog.
I have never downloaded any music. I was confused by it when younger and thought it was all illegal and that has put me off ever since.
I always act hard done by when I have to take the dog out to score points with the wife. But secretly I love it. An hour out the house with my headphones on just me and my dog
"Madly in love with a beautiful, kind and clever woman and amazingly she feels the same. Pity we're both married to other people. We've agreed nothing will happen and we shouldn't keep in contact. Heartbroken."
"A Tory MP was a tenant for a company I worked for. I'd regularly make him call us by sending him reminders for money he didn't owe. I'd like to say it's because he's a massive racist homophobe, but it's mostly because he insisted on being called Sir to 'respect the title'. Knob."
I was 19 before I realised a condom is not meant to cover the balls as well

I once maxed out the internet limit of a holiday cottage by downloading porn

"I had to live with this absolute dickhead in my first year of uni; smoking indoors, constant mess in the kitchen, twatty mates round 24/7 etc. So if I ever saw he had food in the oven, I'd turn the temperature up to maximum. Burnt pizza for him every time"

"I found out my boyfriend cheated on me. He'd always been conscious about his thinning ginger hair. I decided to mix his shampoo with hair removal cream. Shockingly, he didn't even notice the change in smell. I did this for 6 weeks before I moved out. He'll always be a bald prick."
"Even though I'm quite wealthy now, I was once really poor. As a result, I never know how much I've got in the bank because I still daren't check. I now live in constant fear that if I do, it will all be gone and I'll be poor again."
"I always try to get a sneaky look at other mens cocks when I'm at the trough. I'm not gay, but it always gratifies me when mine is bigger. Having said that, I was once next to an old man who was at least 8 long x 2 wide LIMP and have never felt so inadequate."

"My mate showed me explicit nudes of his side-chick. He then fell in love with her, & dumped his long term gf."
It's now been 10 years since he promoted her & it's still awkward for me when I see her. Probably more so because I had multiple wanks over the pics.
Bloke who I sit opposite at work took up cycling and has been his only topic of conversation for months. Bought an £18 hearing aid from Amazon and now when he starts I just tap it and shrug. Work is actually bearable again

"My husband used to lay in bed naked, legs akimbo and I'd complain about the smell of poo so he'd go and use a wet toilet wipe to freshen up. Turns out he never washed his arse until I told him to, age 40. When we split up I told EVERYONE about his filthy bum hole."
"My brother in law begged us to lend him £1k, we did but he never paid us back. I hope he never does since it means I'll never have to speak to his dull wife again."

"I was leaving a sales job I had stopped giving a fuck about, so started telling customers the unvarnished truth about the quality of various electrical manufacturers. I am sure Toshiba lost several grands worth of laptop sales thanks to my hatred of their pre-installed bloatware."
"Our street never had parking spaces, it was a free for all. Parking outside That One Cunts house would cause him to knock on your door at all hours, demanding you moved your car.I lost count of the number of times I pissed on his doorstep late at night."
I'm an NHS dietician and 80% of my work is girls who weigh under 45 kilos thinking they are too heavy. You have literally no idea what your dieting and performative I feel fat - when you know full well you're not- social media posts are doing to young people. I do. Please stop.
"Me and my ex husband married after 9 year, on holiday he went away with someone else but unbeknown to him so did I. I filed for divorce on grounds of adultry and got half of everything. He still doesn't know"

I walk through a graveyard with my dog and he poos on people's grave. When I pick it up I say sorry about that to the dead person.
When me and my friend were about 10 we used to go into book shops just to read sex books. We would hide the books inside of a kids story book then sit at the kids reading area secretly finding out how to have earth-shattering orgasms.
"Sometimes, when I poo, I wipe and I wipe and I wipe. Still poop. It's like wiping a marker."
I always say to tattooed friends/people that their tattoos look amazing even if it looks awful. And they never know if I mean it or not. There's no point saying I hate it when they've got it forever anyway.
"I have 3 pre-planned body dump sites. An emergency/quick one; a medium security one but requiring more time to utilise; and one where the goods will never be discovered but would need the luxury of not having to rush. I have no intention of ever killing anyone, but, be prepared!"
I once got a round of applause in the Albert Hall. It during a young person's religious event. The program was several sheets of A4 with the order of service. Sitting high up I couldn't resist. I made a paper airplane. The plane circled three times and crashed onto the stage.
"When I was 21 I'd written a love letter to Alison, she came back to my flat, picked up my notebook and asked, is that a letter to me?"
"I snatched it off her, and said something about not reading my private stuff."
"30 years later, still the worst decision I ever made"
When I make my wife a sandwich I use the opportunity to remove the toast crumbs from the butter.
The nice old man who lives next door has just fired up a petrol chainsaw and started cutting his hedge at seven in the morning on a Sunday and I have never wanted someone to accidentally cut their own hand off more.
"You spent the whole night talking to me, went out of your way to drive me home, sucked me off, apologised a lot for not going further, visited me at work to say what a great night it was. I never called you, 30 years had lots of regret about what might have been, sorry Sarah"
"Because of the title and the famous poster of Marilyn Monroe grabbing her crotch, I always thought The Seven Year Itch was about a woman who had an itchy fanny for 7 years"
"I went to school with a guy named Pollock. He was a smarmy cunt, I hated him. Used to change his name to Bollock with a pen on all his books and various class lists but pretended to sympathize and be outraged when he got upset about it. Secretly was laughing my ass off."
I flash my headlamps at oncoming cars when there's no camera on the opposite side of the road so they slow down. I don't flash when there IS one. Speed kills you dicks.
I'm a respectable family woman in my late 30s and I have no idea how many men I've slept with. Think it's between 40-50. 80% one night stands while I was drunk in my 20s. Don't regret it but wish I could remember more about them!
"In over 3 years of marriage my husband's electric razor has given me more orgasms than his cock has. If we ever divorce, I'm getting custody of the razor."
"Interviewed for job in a school. Had to answer questions from the student council. Asked if I knew any jokes, panicked and told the first one that came to me. "
How does Michael Jackson know when it's time for bed? When the big hand touches the little hand. 
Didn't get the job.
"7 years ago, on a second date, I told a girl I wanted children long term just to keep her sweet and get her into bed that night. I really didn't want children.One thing led to another, we got engaged, married and recently had a kid. Who I love more than life itself."

"My workplace has a lax security system for its digital kit. As the manager, I'll regularly order bits and bobs for production that end up in my fully kitted out home studio. It's been 10 years of profit. Kerching!"
"When I listen to my favourite albums- The Stone Roses, Definitely Maybe, All Change, Parallel Lines, Everything Must Go, I realise I've wasted the opportunities I had 25 years ago. I've done nothing with my life."
A former colleague died of Covid-19 yesterday and although it's terribly sad I'm secretly relieved I can't attend his funeral. Meeting all those people from so long ago would be unbelievably tedious. There's a reason we lost contact you cunts.
I hate all these youtubers who make £££'s opening toys/stupid challenges as they come across having a perfect life doing fuck all. I'm insanely jealous and wish i could do the same.
"For the truly most mellow @fesshole experience, like the Instagram page where we've remembered to post exactly ONE post.(We were going to automate it but then forgot. Maybe we'll get round to it later)https://t.co/eVnDNEYbQ5"

I robbed a corona virus care package from someone's doorstep because I needed the milk.
I'm a cop and I regularly let people off with minor crimes because I hate the system.

I keep being given plants I hate them I don't want them please stop giving them to me. They make me feel guilty when they die
Lockdown & working from home has given me the chance to have two wanks and three spliffs a day during the week. I'm a senior civil servant.
"Instead of saying thank you to the driver when I get off the bus, I say cheers. But a few years ago I changed that to jizz. I'm in my 50s but it makes me very happy"
"I have no sense of smell. Only my family know. I have got away with it for 40 years by just agreeing with people when commenting on smells. Now I'm too embarrassed to admit it, it's gone on too long"
"Walking the dog in the woods, I come across a lovely high end multitool. Knife, pliers, screwdriver, that sort of thing. I pick it up. 2 mins later I see a council forestry worker looking for something, I say nothing."
I feel bad every time I use it.
I wrote my uni dissertation on the impact of corporations avoiding tax. I now work for a professional services firm and my role is to help clients avoid tax.
"I really, really hate peas being served on a plate next to chips, especially if they're touching. Makes me feel sick how everyone else seems to ignore the fact they turn the chips green and soft. It's. Just. Gross."
The rush I get from playing the extended remix of Hi Ho Silver - the theme from 'Boon' - on a loop at full blast while dancing around my apartment is better than almost any drug I ever took.
"Since the pandemic kicked off, I've lowered my kitchen blinds a bit so no-one can see I've got coke"
Turns out my last wank was too energetic and I hurt some skin. That was three days ago and I just had to turn down real sex because I feared the pain.

"Unfollowed JK Rowling because of all this Ickabog nonsense. I'm sorry, but I'm just not interested in random kids' crap drawings all over my timeline"
"Whenever I see rainbow drawings in people's windows I check that the colours are correct, and silently judge the child if they've got them wrong."
First job doing data entry. 6 boring weeks bashing in data. This was early 90s so had to copy finished thing onto a floppy disk. Accidentally did 'del .' on the c drive. Was going to do a runner before IT man rescued me with Norton utilities. It was like God intervened.
I don't watch porn on new laptops or iPads for 6 months after buying as they're 'clean' and 'fresh' and I don't want to spoil them
I used to be a musician. I took a shit on a tour bus because I knew BB King was the only other person to have ever done so on that bus before. You can't flush on tour buses. The tour manager made me scoop the poo out with my hands.
Think I might have to divorce my husband. He thinks Dominic Cummings did nothing wrong.
"I'm deaf in my left ear . However, if I'm in a meeting and the other person is annoying me I often pretend I couldn't hear them and just blame it on my deaf left ear"
Literally the only reason I ever clapped for carers is that the girl who lives opposite is quite fit and I got to see her once a week when she came out onto her doorstep.
"I regularly ring up my old work place ict desk and report faults under usernames I remember, I feel so good wasting their time"
My fiancee laughs in her sleep and it scares the life out of me. Apparently it is a common sleeping disorder. But knowing that doesn't make me less terrified when it wakes me up in the night.
"I say Can I get... in shops because I know how it annoys people. Middle-class places like ridiculous delis and co-op bakeries etc are the best for it, you get actual eye rolls and audible tuts."
"At school we discovered you could access anyone's personal folder. The day before a deadline, we deleted all of a bully's coursework."
"The 15 minutes I spend with my beautiful hairdresser, Monika, is the best 15 minutes of my month....I am married to a twat and I dream of how good life could be..."
"Around 1991-92, when much younger, I was sadly partly but mostly responsible for the death of a polar bear at chessington zoo, no one believes me either."
"I'm a 45 year old bloke and I've never danced in front of my partner, family or friends. I can't dance and feel ridiculously self-conscious of it."
Buy when everyone's out of the house I crank up the stereo and dance around like a giddy 5 year old after a jumbo bag of haribo
My husband is balding and he refuses to accept it so he tries to do a comb over but it looks atrocious. I find him more and more repulsive with each day that passes.

"In the 90s as a horny teen, the only Internet access was in the living room and no easy access to dirty mags, just old Nintendo ones from my older brother. Churned out some desperate wanks to 'hi res' Princess Zelda, Peach, etc, images..."
"I once shagged a bird at 4am in a betting shop I managed as I had nowhere else to take her, the entire thing was captured on CCTV and I had to nervously wait a month for no robberies so the footage could be deleted"
"My ex-boss was a twat. Among other annoying traits, he insisted on quoting naff idioms like 'Over the Moon' or 'Sick as a Pig'. Once he invited us to a house party where drunk, I urinated in his vinegar bottle. Now I piss on his chips."
"I hate people knowing I've been for a shit. At work if someone is already in there I pretend to use the urinal. If someone walks in, I'll sit on the loo until they leave. I walk out the toilet with my phone in my hand so people think I took so long because I had a call"
My girlfriend had a hamster. I noticed the cotton wool from the nest box had fallen on the floor so I poked it back into the cage. Next day I found out the hamster had died and I realised the cotton I put back in the cage was covered in nail polish remover. I never admitted it.
When I first discovered masturbation my father kept a medicated shampoo bottle to treat his dandruff that had a wider-than-normal opening which I used to wank into. I'm still haunted by the thought of him wondering why his condition was worsening despite doctors orders.
"I recently learned that if I whisper lights off to the Alexa it whispers back. Only sexy moment in my day, even if it is a robot trying to sell electrical goods"
I love a beer. Moreso during lockdown. But the sound of opening a can depresses the fuck out of me because I picture myself as one of the guys on Men Behaving Badly. I genuinely can't shake that image.
"In 2005 I bought the sound track to Layer Cake on cd from a record shop. The security label covered both sides of the lid. I dehinged the case, took the cd and replaced it with a Jenna Jameson dvd. I returned it and got a full refund. Someone got a cream pie instead of layer cake"
"Sam Neill might be in his seventies but he is sexy AF with that lockdown beard and would definitely get it if he ever spent the night in Hull, maybe in the Premier Inn."
Two amazing things have happened during lockdown. I've started shagging my hot Norwegian housemate - her boyfriend is stuck in New Zealand - and I've watched every episode of Rumpole of the Bailey. Leo McKern was perfectly cast as the grumpy barrister.
I can't drive so my girlfriend drives me most places. I started playing football with a few colleagues and leaned in for a kiss when one of them dropped me off at home. It will haunt me until the day I die
"When I was a smal boyl, I played I'll show you mine if you show me yours with two girl friends. I met them separately about twenty years later, and they are both Lesbians. I wonder did I turn them that day ?"
"I've been mistakenly on the mailing list of a Freemason's Lodge for years. I have everything. Names, addresses, bank account details, plus minutes from every meeting. I'll never do anything illegal with the info, I'm not stupid. I just think it's hilarious. Secret society my arse"
"I've been gathering intelligence and passing it to the police about a local drug dealer for months. He doesn't know yet, but I'm pretty sure he's going to get raided soon. Can't wait"
"Geocaching, Google if you don't know what that is. I like to hunt for the caches and destroy them. All because the people who do it call non-cachers muggles."

"Shared a house with some students a few years back in Leicester. After becoming increasingly wound up by them helping themselves to my expensive M&S salted butter from the fridge, I decided to teach them some manners by marinading the next block overnight in the bowl of my toilet"
"During my retail days, whenever I had to make an in store announcement over the PA system I would always start with Good morning Lardies & Gentle Ben instead of Ladies & Gentlemen."
I rarely watch porn but I often masturbate over women I know or have previously slept with. I'm not sure if this is more or less problematic than porn?
"I was 8yrs old in 1974 when 2 anti-nuclear Germans called at the front door looking for donations. I gleefully presented them with my 2 Action Man figures, one in regular Wehrmacht uniform, the other in full SS regalia. I was a blond, blue-eyed kid and must have terrified them."
I still don't know the difference between &lt; and &gt;. Didn't understand when they taught it at school & frankly wish everyone would use the words instead
I went to Baikonur Cosmodrome to witness a rocket launch but got remarkably drunk and otherwise fucked up and missed the whole thing. At home I had to make up complete lies about the ear-shredding noise and overpowering smell of burning kerosene. It cost a bloody fortune.
I work in a restaurant. If you fail to turn up without cancelling your booking I will call you from a withheld number in the middle of the night and hang up. I'll do this multiple times if a large group.
"I dropped out of uni twice. I've lied in job interviews about having a degree for years, it's never been checked and I've had a successful career because of it. I feel guilty for taking the opportunity away from somebody who's studied and earned their education."
During lockdown a neighbour began removing rust from an old motorbike with an angle grinder. After 4 days I snuck into his shed at night and put the grinder in a bucket of water and blocked his outside power outlet with expanding foam. I regret nothing.
I have an asthma inhaler that I've modified to dispense cocaine in small doses. I can now use wherever I am including when representing clients in court.
"I've watched far too many Gangster movies over the years, so every morning when i go to work i'm perpetually reluctant to turn my car key to start the engine incase i've had a hit placed on me. I may start taking public transport."
I've just scrolled through my mate's wife's Instagram and she's made the same face in every single photo since starting her account in 2013. There are over 500 photos. She needs to get a life.
"I cannot stand most of my siblings. I'm the only person in the family who talks to all of them though, so I feel I need to pretend to be nice. They're all selfish and I cannot stand it."
I became a campus slag at Durham University in the early 90s. I went to bed with a different guy nearly every other night. I'm now married with three kids and have a successful career in law. But I still want to get trashed on snakebite and fuck strangers.
I'm 26. Female. My boyfriend lives in London. I'm in lockdown in my shared house in Bristol with my two male housemates. I started fucking one of them after two weeks the other after three weeks and both together after four weeks. I blame the government.
I don't drink tea or coffee so every morning I have a can of Strongbow with my breakfast. When people ask me what I drink in the morning if I don't like tea or coffee I tell them I drink apple juice.

"My obnoxious, bullying manager has died from coronavirus / being a fat, lazy cunt. I feel like I've passed from night to day. I can't wait to get back into the office."
We tell people we can't have any more kids but the truth is our son was so awful as a baby we both nearly had mental breakdowns. He didn't sleep one single night until he was 18 months old and would scream his head off constantly. He's great now but a sibling? No fucking chance.
"In 1993 whilst on holiday in North Wales, I tricked another boy into stepping in a dog shit. I really regret it, but still chuckle about it sometimes."
"Got drunk with new girl at work, went back to hers, whilst doing her from behind I shouted 'I'm not taking any prisoners'. The relationship didn't go far."
"I tried everything to stop the neighbours cat pooing in my garden. Nothing friendly worked. I upped my game, bought an animal trap and caught the cat and then drove into the next town and set it loose. Problem solved."
I've spent thousands on camera equipment and keep them on auto. I've no idea what I'm doing.
"When drinking my favourite brand of cup-based soup, I'm always careful not to stir it too hard, as the best part about it is the gloopy powder at the bottom."
"I lost 50kg whilst living on cocaine and pizza, I now promote Herbalife with the before and after photos"
"I really really LOVE slurping tea. It feels great, and I don't care who it annoys."
My family know not to come in to the study if they hear me on a work call. I've recorded a few hours of actual work meetings which I now play back while I sit and watch films with my headphones on
"During lockdown, just for variety, I've started making my sandwiches Scooby-style with another slice of bread between each layer of filling. Going through about a loaf every day-and-a-half, but don't think I'll ever go back to my old ways now."
I took LSD for my English GCSE and got a D. Resat it next year and got an F because I was fried on Ecstacy.
"Dropped a croissant on the floor at an M&S self-checkout. Picked it up, paid for it, took it home, and ate it. During a pandemic."
"Our son believed he needed glasses, but just wanted them to look smart. The eye exam confirmed it. We bought him £10 display glasses. He put them on and was like finally, I can see, we never told him. Easier than dealing with his shit."
"I once dated a french chef, on our second date he asked if he could lick my arse hole , he said it was okay for me to shit in his mouth whilst he anally licked me out. I legged it!"
"Even though my chances of action are vanishingly slim, every night after putting the kids to bed I wash my cock; on the off chance that my wife will have sex with me. There is always hope."
Sometimes I go for a shower when I actually need a piss. I like showering as much as I dislike the monotony of going for a wee.

I was once so horny I masturbated to blue planet. There was something about Attenborough's soft voice against the chaos of a feeding frenzy that worked in the moment. The post wank existential turmoil was a killer though.
"I've become convinced that the wood lice and worms in my compost bin worship me as a benevolent deity, periodically bringing light into their world and dropping a bounty of food from the sky."
"I just made a gluten free, dairy free banana bread. Don't worry, I hate myself too."
"Regularly used to leave parties without saying goodbye to anyone til I read somewhere it was an utter dick move designed to draw as much attention to oneself as possible and when I thought about it for one minute, realised that was right and I was a cunt."
I hang around a well known UK coastal suicide spot in the hope I can intervene and be a hero. I've seen three people go over the edge this year and I feel like a failure. I wish they'd hang around a while and give me a chance instead of going straight at it.
When I'm in a car and pass a wedding I ALWAYS wind down the window and shout don't do it!. Always raises a laugh but I mean it.
I once took two lambs from a farmers field. I sold one to the local takeaway. I ordered a lamb curry the next day and it finally tasted like it had lamb in it. The other is running around my garden now. We called him Steve.

"When people who irritate me post anything risqué on Instagram of facebook, I report them. For no reason other than irritating them."
I eat mushy pea on toast and have told my girlfriend it is a Avacado so she doesn't get freaked out
"I'm too proud to forgive one of my past English teachers who, when I used the word 'thrice', laughed at me and said that such a word doesn't exist, making a fool of me in front of the class. Everytime I come across that word I'm positively basking in her incompetence."
I'm a civil servant and working for this government makes me sick.
"I would love to have an affair but the truth is I can't because I'm ashamed of my naked body as my ball bag hangs low and off my actual balls. I'm only just forty. I could have had an affair at least twice, and it's the only thing that's stopped me doing it."
"I often squeeze out shits I don't need to take because I can't stand my family, my work colleagues or my job. Two or three extra shits a day."
Added as a wrong number to someone else's work whatsapp group. No idea who they are or where they work. Watched and read delicious stories of extra marital affairs and group sex with their boss. Very horny stuff. Shagged my wife many times thinking about it.
I have ordered and enjoyed pizza with pineapple twice this month and i will do it again

"My boss once gave me his email password so I could send some emails on his behalf. He's married; lovely wife. Well, half his inbox was dating website emails. I've wanted to tell someone for ages but I love the guy and don't want to destroy his marriage or reputation."
When walking along the pavement and a cyclist is coming up behind me I deliberately walk much slower and in the middle of the pavement so they have to go on the road - where they should be
I use to think Silicon Valley was a place for people to go for plastic surgery. I mean silicon breast implants right?
"Andrew, I'm a lesbian. I masturbate. I don't think of you when I do it. You're bland. I want to leave you, but your insipid greyness has filled me with inertia & I can't summon the energy to go."
"Sometimes I vacuum up the little LEGO pieces or Sylvanian Families accessories or LOL Doll shoes on purpose, just so I never have to tidy them away again."

"I'm 44, I'd describe my life as unremarkable. I do all the right things. However, whenever I drive past a police car I position my hand out of sight and give them the middle finger. I don't know why"
"In the 80s we had a lean-to shed on the side of our house, it caught fire and nearly burnt our house down - gas canisters for our oven etc in it. My dad assumed an electrical fault but it was 9yr old me through trying to battle damage my star wars x-wing with matches & a candle"
"I have a massive collection hedgehogs, fluffy toys and ornaments. It started when my friend bought me one and snowballed. Every time someone sees one they buy it for me. Fridge magnets, tea towels. But I hate the things. Really hate them."
When peeling a banana I always ensure that it peels in 2 or 3 strips. This is a result of being told at school that if I put anything with 4 skins into my mouth I would be a massive bender.
I'm 48.
"My daughter just lost her tooth but cause we're on lockdown & i haven't used cash for ages i have no change, only a tenner so I've told her the tooth fairy is on lockdown cause of covid19"
"I eat a Snickers bar by nibbling all the chocolate around the sides, then along the top, then along the bottom including the nougat and finally the nutty toffee."
Often when I'm going for a piss at home I get my cock out before I have reached the bathroom and pull myself towards the bathroom

"I have this one DJ around my age - 50 -that I follow on Instagram. Only because I really don't like him, his music nor his style. I mostly enjoy the videos he posts of his fans that are mostly weird women dancing in hilariously bad ways to his music in their kitchens."
"I started an ironic Pro Brexit twitter account but so many Quitters didn't get the jokes I stopped making them, It has over 7000 followers, I use it to tweet things I know are wrong or contrary to what https://t.co/6r1H4YBVSa have tweeted, just to sow discord."
Had some short lived but fairly decent success in the music industry in the early 90's. Was good friends with Annie Lennox and Ringo Starr for a couple of years. Now I'm an accountant
My claim to fame is a famous 90s indie artist has seen my vagina
35 years ago our then cleaner caught me on the couch spanking with a magazine. I was so embarrassed that I told my mum I'd seen her rifling threw her jewellery. She was fired.
I'm a gay man who's never given blood. I haven't had sex for years so technically could but that would mean admitting it to people. They can carry on thinking I'm a slapper.
"Even when watching a quiz show alone, my rule is that I don't get the points unless I actually say the answer out loud"
I wish there would be a second spike of COVID cases so I don't have to go back and work with reception children.
I once filled ex Blue Peter presenter Lesley Judd's jacket pocket with Cauliflower Cheese at a WRVS grand dinner. I was a waiter and her jacket was hung on her chair. I knew I'd done it and simply walked away. The guilt lives with me.
"If my posts don't get enough views on social media, I delete them and pretend they never happened."
"I hate all these learn to code initiatives. It's about flooding the market with cheap devs to drive prices down, this is why there's no Learn To Lawyer. You keep prices up by building a big license moat."
"I fantasise about travelling back in time to 1939 and giving the British Government the plans for weapons from the mid-1950s so that we can beat the Germans sooner, and preserve our position as a great power, but without making it look like we received weapons from the future."
I stood at the dispatch box during a school trip to parliament in 1995. As we listened to the tour guide I used my thumbnail to write my initials in the soft green surface of the lectern. Hope my tag is still there.
I picked my nose and stuck a boogie on the underside of Salvador Dali's lobster phone when it was on exhibition in London 20 years ago.
"I still have 6 or 7 'smut mags' in the loft. Haven't read them for 20 years. Can't bring myself to ditch them, but a piece of me is ruing the day they get discovered. Doubly concerned it will be after I've checked out and my family are going through my lifetime of keepsakes."

My wife is terrified of spiders. Sometimes when she asks me to catch them they escape and I have to pretend I'm carrying a spider outside and throwing it into the garden when I know it's still loose in the house.
I'm in HR for a very large multi national company.

I had an abortion 9 years ago and never told my husband. Couldn't face starting again at the age of 45 with another baby. I also suspected my husband was in love with someone else at the time.Think of what he/she would be like now and feel guilty.

"People who throw French words into conversations are cast-iron cunts and I've sacked three people, ostensibly for other reasons but actually for this."
I've lived in the US for almost 20 years now and still don't know how to order eggs in a restaurant. I just order scrambled. I don't really like my eggs scrambled.
I open and reseal parking tickets on cars and in the 'reason for violation' box write 'because you're a cunt.'
Over the course of the lockdown I've been experimenting with wearing socks and sandals around the house/garden. Now I don't know if I can stop.
I'm a voiceover artist. An ad agency dickhead asked me and another voice to self-record some background mumbling voices for a radio advert set in a bar. We said 'cunt' 5 times in the ad and no one noticed.
"Whenever I cook alone, I pretend I'm filming for a YouTube cooking channel. I reckon it would be very popular."
Whenever I hang out my wife's knickers on the washing line I use 2 pegs to emphasise their size. 1 peg does fine for my boxers.
"Born/adopted in 68. Traced biological mother last year but she rejected me. She got married/had a son a decade later, who probably doesn't know about me. I suppose she is afraid of damaging her relationship with him. Would really like to meet my 1/2 brother."

I love Paul McCartney but I'm secretly looking forward to his death. When Michael Jackson died his music was everywhere for about 6 months. I often daydream about the mass singing in pubs of Let it Be or Hey Jude and I absolutely can't wait #RIPPaul
I sell conspiracy related merchandise online and now have a database full of the details of nutters around the world.
"I am a plumber, a customer was very rude to me as I was 10 minutes late due to traffic, so I took a shit into their water tank."
"For years I thought Mick Hucknall was a single word name, like Madonna. McCooknell. Still confuses me now."
I judge whether used jeans of mine are still good to wear by holding them up to my nose and taking a hard deep sniff of the zipper. I got this from my mum who once did this when I was a kid.
"Just heard my housemate shagging his girlfriend for the first time in like 2 months, happy for him"
Since the lockdown started l have been visiting a friend. He sits in the conservatory and l sit in the garden. We share alcoholic ginger beer. When l get home l tell my partner that l decided to take a longer walk. He would be pissed off if he knew. I quite like having a secret
I often wink at things I plan to eat later as I close the fridge door.
"I think the song 'Never Forget' by Take That is one of the greatest songs of all time. I'm a 38-year-old male, I still know all the words and I even know the dance moves that I do in the mirror if I'm alone."
I have to be stoned when I walk my dog or else my constant anxiety makes her overprotective of me and she tries to bite passersby.

"My parents split when i was 3, one night a few years later i was maybe 8-9 i heard the man shagging my mum in her bed say 'Surely you cant be doing this just for the money' i never told anyone, im 50 now"
I've just farted and it made the exact same noise as when the X comes up on Family Fortunes. I will try to do it again but it may end in disaster. Wish me luck.
I was once stopped by a man who spoke little English at a train station asking for a particular platform. He had a large suitcase and I presume he was going to the airport. I'd had a bad day and was late for my own so I just pointed him in some random direction. I hope he made it
"I have recently started working as a delivery driver for a supermarket due to this coronavirus wankfest. I regularly discourage customers from accepting their substitutes so refund them and keep the food substitutes myself. Et voila, free grub!"

"I spent an hour helping my kids search for 2 bars of chocolate that they'd lost, but in reality I'd eaten them a few hours before."
"I try to make an anagram out of every car license plate I see. If I can't, I allow myself extra vowels, but no consonants. That's just cheating"
"I hate anything brown, orange or yellow. It causes a noise in my brain. People say I might be autistic. The doctors disagree. Doctors are probably correct. Something's not right though"
I always pour myself a slightly larger glass of wine than I do for my girlfriend. I love her but I'm heavier than her and I think it's fair
One of our mates recently became a dad and it's the best thing that ever happened to our friendship group because now he's too busy to talk to us and we all think he's a cunt
I was 18 when I had my first kiss because there were no girls in my school. Don't send your kids to a single sex school. It's weird

I put sugar on frosties

"I'm a senior manager at a large corporate company, and I still don't know the alphabet"
"I use my wife's fancy conditioner for frizzy hair on my sack n crack. It makes my coarse dry arsehair feel amazing and fresher far longer than just shower gel. I highly recommend conditioning yer bumbeards, lads"
My son is a right-wing incel arsehole. I dread it when he rings. It's like listening to that Prison Planet prick.
"Use my work phone to donate money to Comic Relief, enter competitions, and buy extra broadband for wanking. They never check the bills. Zero guilt."

I once stinkpalmed David Cameron at a conference
After my mother died I was clearing out her house and found lots of old photographs.Mostly innocent stuff - holiday snaps and us as kids but then I found a few graphic amateur porn ones with my parents in them taken badly by my Dad. Now I can't wank without horrifying flashbacks.
When I first met my bf we couldn't keep our hands off each other. A good few years down the line & I've lost my sex drive. We've both let ourselves go & I just don't want to have sex. He's my first serious relationship so I don't know if this is normal or if we're drifting apart.
My partner has a kid from a previous relationship. Kids ain't for me but I thought I'd get used to it. It's been 9 years and I'm still not. Just waiting for her to grow up so I can have her dad to myself.
"Even after a couple of decades, I'm still not over my parents' divorce. And it disgusts me every time I see a couple having children when they clearly won't be together for much longer."
"Any time I see Nicholas Lyndhurst on TV playing a serious role, I think to myself You'll never shake off Rodney Trotter and it fairly cheers me up. The plonker."

A school friend let me borrow True Lies on DVD in 2005 & I still haven't watched it.

"Neighbour who every sodding year helps herself to the rhubarb that grows in my garden is probably unaware that when I take the dog for a last turn, I piss all over it. Her rhubarb crumbles and cakes look right nice on Instagram."
I'm Dutch but studied in Scotland. I have £16k student loan debt there. I no longer live in Scotland. I'm ashamed to say a part of me hopes for 'splendid isolation' and shitty relations between the UK and Europe so they don't/can't enforce. My overall uni experience wasn't go...
"Saw a porno yesterday with someone who was my exact cock double, really threw me, never conceived of a cock double before"
"I've spent almost every waking moment in the past 65 days with my girlfriend in lockdown. Today she returned to work. I didn't, Now I know how parents feel when their children finally return to school after the summer ends. I honestly haven't ever been this happy to be alone."
I earn nothing and am therefore not required to pay off student loans. That I am married to a wealthy man and could settle the debts immediately is no concern of the loan company. They get cancelled in a few years anyway.
I don't miss seeing my friends and family at all.
In the last 20 years I've had multiple sexual partners besides my official partner who has never known about the others. The secret is just not to say anything. It's really not hard.

Sometimes I use parcel tape marked FRAGILE to seal up entirely robust packages

"My other half used to torment me by regularly cheating, so I decided to torment him by convincing him he was going insane by secretly, and regularly, throwing away his keys, wallet or phone when he was asleep. He was convinced he was developing early-onset dementia."
"During lockdown, the wife convinced me to watch The Greatest Showman with her. I actually quite enjoyed it. There, I said it."
"During lockdown I've been drinking so much that I've set up 4 different online shopping accounts. That way, none of the deliverers realise how much booze I'm having."
I'm a gay man but I only wank to lesbian porn
Many years ago I had a low paid temp job entering completed student enrolment forms into the university's admissions system. Eventually I got so bored that i started changing various details to amuse myself - including the degree courses.
"I know I'm not supposed to like the cheap peanut butter, cos it kills the orangutans, but I can't help myself. The expensive eco-friendly stuff is claggy and bland. The cheap shit is sweeter, saltier and tastier all round. Yummy Palm Oil."
"My first girlfriend would invite me round for sex, randomly at short notice. Being a fairly unhygienic teen, I used to wash my nob in her parents' cloakroom sink. Seemed reasonable at the time, but looking back I have a horrible feeling they knew."
Today my best friend of 14 years didn't ask me to be his best man. He asked two of our other really good friends. We'd always promised we'd be each other's best man and now I feel like my memories with him are tainted. I'm so happy for him but I can't tell him how crushed I am.
I'm cherishing every moment of my two children being small and thinking I'm great. Because one day they'll discover that I'm actually a tedious loser who nobody respects.
"I am currently using a standing desk - I'm in my 50's and have a bad back - while I'm working I put my headphones on, nod my head while I'm staring down at my work and pretend I'm a world-famous DJ"
I hate nearly everyone. Except the dog. I like the dog. A lot.
I often wonder if at some point I have wanked at every minute of a day. So for instance if I wake up and its 3.14am ill crack one off so I know its been covered. I have no idea how close or far I am to completing this challenge. I know 5am - 6am isnt that fruitful.
"I work a 4 day week and my wife works 5. She thinks I clean the house on a Friday for her. Every 2nd week I get topless cleaner in. The cleaning company is great, I can choose a different topless cleaner every week."

"I'm addicted to porn. No one knows, least of all my girlfriend. Not sure what to do. Everything online says 'get help' but that's much easier said than done, especially since I'm dead broke"
"I'm a 47 year old happily married man, I have a well paid job where I work from home a lot."

Around the time of Madeleine McCann's disappearance I was having an affair with a beautiful Portuguese woman. Happiest time of my life. Every time I hear about McCann it reminds me of that affair.
Watches are designed to be worn on the left wrist. If I see someone wearing one on their right I take an instant dislike to them. I have even turned down a well qualified applicant for a job role because we was a right wrist watch wearer.
Sometimes on Tinder I swipe left on someone so utterly revolting that I then have to vigorously swipe left on the next 3-4 people without even looking at them.
"I read all the Buzzfeed articles on Game of Thrones, so knew all the characters and was quite into it until I actually watched an episode and found it was crap."
I keep an old big key for a garage I no longer have with my house keys so I can always have a bigger bump when a bag of coke is being passed around that my friends and I have all put money towards.
"I work with blind people, if I have to explain a load of food choices to them I just pick a few otherwise they take too long."
"In my teens I used to steal VHS tapes regularly from Woolworths. Wrestlemania 88-93 tapes, most Van Damme movies, Predator, Commando, RoboCop and more are most likely still hidden under the insulation in the loft of my Mum's - now sold - house."
"I desperately want to have sex with my sister in-law. Truth is she isn't even that attractive, just the ultimate forbidden fruit."
Some kind hearted souls regularly put out sweets in the reception area of our block of flats to thank the delivery drivers dropping off parcels. I always take one - two if I'm feeling particularly greedy
"I'm a MD in a global bank. I've done no work for 10 years, all I do is reply to emails and show up to meetings. I got a massive productivity bonus last year and was told I'm a key man dependency. It's like 2008 didn't happen."
"We live next to a school, but opted to send our daughter to a private school ten miles away. A decision based purely on the spelling and grammar of the locals on our village's Facebook group."
I wish I'd had sex with more people before I got married. Men and women.
As a kid I got a ton of viruses on the family computer after watching porn. I blamed my stepdad or stepbrother and my parents believed me because mom doesn't think women whack off
"I often run my girlfriend a bath. I light candles, get her some wine, put music on etc. She thinks I'm being lovely, I just want her out of the way so I can play FIFA in peace."
Having exhausted every possible category of porn - save for illegal ones - I've now graduated to wanking over images of unbuilt architecture. Herzog & de Meuron's site is my new PornHub.

"When I take a pee first thing in the morning, I take my belly button fluff and drop it into the toilet. As it falls I pretend I'm clay pigeon shooting and attempt to hit it with my pee jet. I have not succeed yet but I know it's in me."
I went to a party at some random blokes flat in Brighton in the 90's. He really pissed me and my mates off so I called the New York speaking clock from his home phone. Apparently he didn't realise for 2 days.
I used to play Street Racer on the SNES and when my mates came round to play it I put a cheat code in and upped all my stats they all thought i was brilliant on the game because it was mine they never suspected foul play
"My name is Peter, and my wife's name is Lois. I named our kids Christopher, Stewart and Megan - annoyingly in the wrong order! My wife is completely oblivious to the significance of this and I'm dreading the day she realises."
"When I first moved in wife my wife and cooked - I gave her the best of the 2 meals, no question. Now, I give myself the best and go out of my way to even present her food poorly and it is reciprocated. Is this greed, passive aggression or is this now a platonic relationship?"
"I've been going through my books to get rid of them. They're not worth anything, the charity shops are all shut and it's freezing here, so I've been burning them."
"When I left school I got a job in McDonald's, I used to short change everyone 20p and keep track of how much I was up, at the end of the day I'd take it out the till. I used to make about £30 a day."
I started using weed for the first time two years ago. Now I do it every day. I'm 63 years old so people just think I'm ancient and have lost my mind. Actually I'm just incredibly high and frankly I get away with murder in pubs and supermarkets.
"I'm a 27-year-old guy. I share a flat with two girls. No sexy stuff at all for two years with either. Now in lockdown. One girl stuck abroad so just me and the other. We started fucking after week two and haven't stopped. Thank you, Covid-19."
"After a shit, I wipe my arse like everybody else but I also use cotton buds to get right in there and sort it out. There was a kid in my school nicknamed Skidmark and I live in fear of ever getting a similar nickname. I don't think anybody else does this do they?"
"As a 14 year old boy, appearing on a regional TV quiz show, I listened in to a conversation Liz Kershaw was having, in makeup, about how she preferred men in boxer shorts to briefs, as she didn't like sweaty bollocks. Never worn briefs since."
My 5 year old is a massive Alvin and the Chipmunks fan. He was upset one day so to cheer him up his Mam told him he could have the chipmunks cd on in the car when I took him out for the day. I put Scooters greatest hits on and told him it was their new album.
In lockdown I keep inventing things I need then just walk around and tell the missus the shops sold out and the queue at the shop was really long. Went for a peaceful 4 mile stroll today.
"When I make tea for people I always do milk then water then teabag, regardless of their specific preferences. No one has ever complained and those that have commented have said it was a lovely cup. Sometimes I admit my deception and they struggle to believe what they are hearing"
"Sometimes I have an argument with my wife because I quite like sleeping on the sofa. For men, it's a bit like camping"
I've told my friends I am allergic to the ingredients used in Korma but the truth is I've had to give it up due to an addiction to it. Korma is my favourite curry.
I can't wait for the 2 smack heads who share a flat across the road to finally overdose and die. It would make my day.

"Every night when tidying away my kids toys in our front room, I tell each and every one of them that they are an annoying cunt.. especially the spontaneous singing ones - fucking cunts"
We did an experiment at school of growing bacteria. We placed bread in a jar with a cotton wool plugged hole in the lid. My friend and I farted in our jar and it grew a rainbow of colours which baffled my science teacher.
Whenever I see a popular tweet I steal it and tweet it as my own. I've got over 60k followers from doing this
My girlfriend works as a cleaner for a famous comedian. She thinks he's her friend but she hates him and steals something every time she cleans there
"With my right-on friends I virtue-signal like crazy but the reality is I use Amazon,Uber and Sports Direct all the time and honestly don't care about workers rights. I want cheap stuff but can't possibly tell my friends although I suspect they're doing the same a lot of the time."
"In '07 I worked in the call centre for BT. One day a customer screamed UNREAL obscenities at me. Not unusual...but this guy was really nuts. So, instead of processing his broadband fault, I put his mobile number on a gay contacts website. Never know, he might have enjoyed it."
"Whenever I set up a public WiFi for a client, I always block The Sn and Ml Online websites. Just a way of helping the community be a little nicer."
My grandma had just bought and moved into Les Dawson's old house. 9-year-old me was playing on the road outside when a weird old man asked me if Les had left any shoes behind? To this day I have no idea what he meant by this. If anybody can shed some light I'd be grateful.

Even fucking 'Jerkmate' adverts are encouraging us to stay at home. A pornographic website is more responsible than our fucking government
"Whenever I'm in London, I always make time to have a poo in the toilets at Fortnum and Mason. Best free toilet in London imho. I always buy some tea on the way out so I don't feel as guilty."
The real reason I bought that WiFi booster is that porn wasn't streaming too well in the bathroom
I once had a wee next to David Beckham. I can confirm that Victoria is just after the money.

Was having a bad day and decided to treat myself to one of my neighbours amazon parcels that I was sure contained a PS4 game. It was vegan multivitamins.
When zoom calls with my friends go on too long I pretend I'm glitching by staying very still and silent then turning off the video then eventually hanging up. I'll message 5 mins later WiFi broke sorry! when really all I wanted was some peace and a cuppa

During lockdown I've been wallpapering and painting several rooms. Before I start I write a 'haunting' message on the wall in red paint. I've also hid a creepy doll in a box in the attic. Wish I could see the future owners faces.
I've been working throughout the lockdown but I do wear my mask and gloves when traveling. I stick my tongue out at almost everybody I walk past and they will never know.
My boss is really vain. So when he lost his company ID and asked me to print a new one I slightly changed the proportion of his nose and eyebrows on his picture. Enough to make him stare at it for a long time but not enough to make it too obvious.
I avoid the living room when hubby is at work then pretend I can't smell the cat litter tray when he gets in so I don't have to change it
I went to school with Duncan from Blue. A couple of years ago I got in contact with him and he didn't remember me. It really pisses me off.
"Back in the day when E's were nice & strong, I was coming up in the middle of a club & felt sick. Not wanting to waste my drugs, I threw up into my mouth, took a deep breath through my nose, swallowed it all back down and carried on regardless. Club got raided later. Good times."
I've been working from home since lockdown started. I'm working maybe 2 hours a day and spending the rest on reddit or playing Animal Crossing. Still on full wages - I earn more per month for doing less in a week than key workers do in a day
I often use a dummy account on ebay to bid on items I'm selling to either push other bids up or save items from being sold too cheaply. I sometimes use it just to piss off pushy buyers who look like they will be arseholes post auction.
I once tried to wank my way through my entire female Facebook friends list in alphabetical order but gave up around D
"I've never cared about another human being as much as I care about my horse in Red Dead Redemption 2. I pressed the wrong button once, accidentally punched him and cried about it for ten minutes."

My wife insists on buying me socks that she likes but I detest . I keep telling her I hate them but she keeps on buying them . I wear them because I'm scared to start an argument. I'm 61
"When my niece was a few months old I was babysitting her.I laid her on the bed,left the room for a second and she rolled off the bed onto the hard floor. She's 19 now,perfectly fine but I'm still wracked with guilt everytime I think about it. I honestly thought I'd killed her."
My wife found a cookie recipe in an old cookbook and assumed the handwriting was my mother's. So she baked them and posted a touching IG picture about them on Mother's Day. I didn't have the heart to tell her the recipe was from an ex-girlfriend.

I work as a reasonably senior civil servant for DHSC and have been utterly broken by the directives handed down to us during the C-19 pandemic and the fact that losses of this scale were expected but completely overlooked by our leaders.
I'm a master of making myself look busy in the office and spacing out 2 hours work into a day. Now i'm working from home I get everything done by 11am and put my feet up until 5pm. Just had a promotion and pay rise too because i use my initiative .
"Bloke at work used to say simples at the end of nearly every sentence, even when it made no sense to add it. He got sacked for lying to get time off but it was quite a minor offence and we all know it was really because of the simples"
I anonymously sent my friend a copy of a book by his favourite author he'd been trying to get hold of for ages and I tippexed out the last two pages.
"I pored a can of oil under my boss's new car every lunchtime to make him think he had a leak. After three months he sold the car. I hated him, it was worth it."
I'm so British that I occasionally say thank you to my Glade sense and spray air freshener when it goes off.
"I have had at least 2 wanks a day since I started working from home in lockdown, now I know why we are all stockpiling toilet paper"
A colleague and I both married fell hard for each other but let it go because we worked together. About 30 mins after I got offered a new job elsewhere we fucked in the disabled toilet. #bothmarried
Every morning I bring my wife coffee and a banana whilst she is in bed. I regularly hide the banana in my pants so she has to dig for it. Been doing it for years and it still makes me giggle like a 14 year old boy. I am a 56 year old man.
"I was walking my dog and stumbled upon a man in a mental health crisis , he was drinking vodka straight and crying, I didn't know what to do so I sat down with him and got wasted with him , we are now really good friends and his life is back on track."
I've been wanking so much in this lockdown that the faintest whiff of my moisturiser gives me a semi

"I used my Casio TV remote control watch to interact with the VCR during English lessons. The teacher was convinced he was emitting magnetic fields, causing BBC's Twelfth Night to pause and rewind by a wave of his hand."
I noted the number of the payphone across from my old flat. One night came my chance for some fun. Empty street apart from old drunk. I called the phone and he answered. I bellowed into the phone that I am God and you better mend your ways. You should have seen his face.
It wasn't really coffee on the duvet.
I love drinking soy sauce in tiny sips out of the bottle but I've recently been on a health kick so I am very grateful for low sodium soy sauce.

Came across one of my kid's teachers on twitter who is actually a right fucking cunt who shouldn't be anywhere near a school. Am screenshotting some of her more cunty tweets just in case I need them at some point.
When my wife performs oral sex on me I sometimes sing quietly to myself the McDonalds song 'I'm lovin it'. Occasionally I change the words to 'she's sucking it'. Either way a blow job is fucking brilliant no matter what song you sing.
"Used to work in a Greggs in Kent. If I ever had to deal with a rude customer, as I handed their food over to them in the paper bags, I'd squeeze it hard while wishing them a good day; leaving a huge thumb and finger gouge... enjoy your steak bake."
Got nicked for Coke a few years ago and did a year in jail. Was targeted by one aggressive individual who didn't like the look of me. Started a rumour that he was a grass and he got shifted to the nonce wing. Problem solved.
I voted Tory once when I was younger and didn't have much of an interest or understanding of politics. I'm genuinely disgusted with myself.
I worked in a factory that had an old clocking in machine that 'couldn't be tricked'. It printed times and notched the corner of the card. Within half an hour I had a complicated system of masking tape and extra cards and claimed hours of overtime each week- was there for 3 yrs.
"I'm happy for new parents and their life-changing event but let's not pretend that parenthood doesn't make you boring as fuck. I mean, it's fine but you are not the same person."

Unbeknownst to everyone I have a tremendous talent for imitating cat noises and I often like to fool people into thinking there's a cat nearby. I once caused a huge kerfuffle in the office cos people thought a cat was stuck in the attic.

My parents-in-law always give me cash for my birthday and xmas. I dont really want anything these days so for the last two years I have spent the cash on prostitutes. I always write them a thank you card
My wife has two horses and I can't fucking stand them. They take all of our disposable income and her time. I wish they would hurry up and die so we can afford to do stuff and have the time to do it.
I would like to have full penetrative sex with The Mandolorian and I would prefer it if he kept his helmet on the entire time. I reckon he'd be utter filth.
Most nights I volunteer to do all the dishes just to be nice. Really my wife is crap at them but it gets me massive points with her.
The singer from the 1975 was a dick to my pal many moons ago. So I stole his glasses while they played their set. I loved watching him storm around in rage when he found out they'd gone.

My friend's father passed away a short while ago. I bought him a bottle of nice whisky so that he could raise a toast to his memory. I drank it all myself and bought a considerably worse bottle from the off licence down the road to give to him instead. I feel quite bad about it.

My ex was a lot taller than me so I used to call him my giraffe as a cute pet name only he got really into it and bought himself a giraffe mask to wear in bed. Not exactly the role play I was after.

"After lockdown my flatmate moved her boyfriend in without checking with me and they spent last night doing loud BDSM until 2 in the morning. I got drunk and, in my rage, stole their stuff from the fridge. I only know this because there's an egg next to me in bed."
"I used to work for Weetabix, we trialled a sugar frosted version , but was deemed too unhealthy, it's a shame because they tasted amazing"

"I once emailed the BBC to correct a mistake by the Cricket statistician Bill Frindall. I was a bit of an arsehole in the way I went about it. I have no idea if it was read, but he died not long after and I still feel bad."
"I don't recycle... Plastic, food waste, cardboard it all goes in a black sack and into the communal bins at my apartment complex. It's not like I hate the earth or anything, and I believe in global warming I just could not be arsed sorting it..."
"My Aunty who was like a second mum to me has died. I'm so sad but also relieved that, because of COVID19, I won't be able to attend her funeral. I know my family would judge me for being so overweight."

"At uni, I used to write plot spoilers on post it notes then leave them halfway through all the library books I'd read thus spoiling the endings for others. I still think it's funny."
"A week after moving in to my new house i found out the person who lived in the house across the street had died and left everything to me. Well, the 'kind hearted man at number 12'. They had dementia and had forgotten the name of the former owner. I made 200 grand."
"Listening to my dog's heart beat is relaxing, I love her so much."
I cut pizza with scissors.
My previous flat never had planning permission for the loft bedroom. I went to the council and stole the original microfiche with the planning details so my buyers solicitors query could never be solved.

"Aged 12, I desperately needed a shit, but my brother was in the bath. I ran outside, crouched behind the car and curled one out. It was winter and freezing cold. The next morning I woke to the sound of my Dad frantically hacking away at the frozen turd stuck to the driveway."

I'm secretly glad of the visiting restrictions in place at the moment as it gives me a justifiable reason not to see my mum. Slightly dreading restrictions being lifted as I won't have an excuse.

A close friend does hourly face to camera stories on Instagram. Each one is complete drivel about the most pointless crap imaginable. I've typed out 2/3 messages asking her to stop but chickened out & have instead muted her. Why does she think people want to listen to her crap?

"I'm ashamed of my dad for marrying my mum and thinking she was good enough to have his children. She is not good enough and should never have been a parent. It's made me resolute to never have children. Don't stick your dick in crazy, and if you do, wear a condom."
Some neighbours preteen kids kept using my bins to climb onto the council garage roof so I pulled the bin back onto my drive while the kids were up there

"I have information which could destroy Boris Johnson's political career, but I can't say anything as it may inadvertently destroy a good friend's career at the same time"

"Once in a difficult month as a student, I agreed to have sex with an older gay gent, who would pay me €100 for 1 hour of my time. We did the deed, but he only paid €70. The desperation and worry about my next meal and the shame that followed has never quite left me."
I've been on chemotherapy and my mum has kindly been dropping shopping off for me since lockdown started. I transfer £100 into her account every time she does it. The shopping is nowhere near that amount. She doesn't know.

Have been enjoying retro wanking over pictures instead of videos.
When I watch porn on my phone I delete my browser history. Even though it's my phone and no one else would see it.
"I took in a ripped train ticket for a refund. The inspector checked the missing parts suspiciously. 'I know you're up to something but I can't work out what,' he said. I stayed quiet. Truth was, I'd used a future ticket for roach materials while wasted."
"I'm 27 years old, privately educated & work for a investment bank but can't say the alphabet in order, time my laces like everyone else or ride a bike. I feel like I'm just muddling through life somehow"
"Because Twitter makes you chose a location so it can feed you whatever overhyped shit is 'Trending', I pretend I live in places like Panama or Malaysia where you're less likely to have to read the latest hysteria about arseholes like Trump and Johnson."
When I was a kid I wanted to be accepted by this group of older rougher kids so I dropped a breeze block onto a small frog. They were horrified
"Late 90s, I worked in an off licence. There was an instant win game under labels on Budweiser. If I left chilled bottles at room temp, the resulting condensation meant I could peel off & find winning labels and put the duds back on. I claimed dozens of prizes & gave them to mates"
I eat a kiwi fruit skin and all. I don't leave anything apart from a tiny hard bit the size of a button at the end. And occasionally I've eaten that too

"Amazon leave parcels in my shed when I'm at work, occasionally I say they aren't there and get a refund. I'd stop if they paid their taxes."
I've never once used a sift when a recipe calls for it.
For years I have visited escorts a couple of times a month. I thought I would miss it in lockdown but actually I'm just enjoying wanking more and saving loads of money.
"I managed a chain of charity shops, we had a donation of collectable cards, the staff priced them up for £10 so I bought them, took them to a specialist who gave me £5k for them, not one penny went into the till, I'd already paid for them in my eyes"
Found out on Facebook that an ex-colleague had recently passed away from a heart condition. Felt sorry until I saw their profile pic with a 'We got Brexit done' banner.
"At university in the 90s, I thought it was the height of romance to leave the handwritten lyrics to Invisible Touch by Genesis in another student's pigeon hole. I didn't even know her. I still cringe when I hear that song."
"When I was a kid I sometimes went in graveyards and stole handfuls of those white or green marble-effect chips from graves because I thought they were quite valuable gemstones. I hid them in my room. I know it doesn't really matter, but I still feel awful now."
I haven't clapped for the NHS even once. I show my support by paying my taxes and not voting tory.
"I'm a student living in a shared house, we often have parties. I'm usually all in for it and a pisshead myself, but there was one occasion where someone was pissing me off so much, but I couldn't figure out how to make them leave, so i called the police on my own party."
"My friends, colleagues and family constantly send me videos, memes and assorted other stupid shit online, I usually just say 'oh cool' or 'lol' or some shit. In reality I have never watched a single one. Not one."

"Pilgrimage to Lourdes: smuggled two acid tabs in a prayer book down the side of the wheelchair of the disabled kid I was looking after. Took them with a mate on the last night and ended up giving a drunk Scouse midget a piggyback. Thought it was the drugs, but he was fucking real"
"At a wedding reception in a country hotel, I drunkenly ordered 10 rounds of pricey sandwiches for the late night revellers. I put them on a random room number. As I left the next morning, I passed a distressed couple on a romantic weekend being asked to pay £150 for sandwiches."
Early on in a relationship I did a number two at my boyfriends house. It was too big to go down so I used the handle of his toothbrush to break it up.I cleaned it as best I could and put it back. I felt guilty as hell but he dumped me a week later so I consider it early revenge.
I used to work at a Spoons in Norwich. When Tim visited I poured his pint from the spill tray. Fuck that guy.
"I advise people on their money and get paid a lot of money to do it. The thing is, I don't really understand the markets but I am a good communicator so I get away with it. I would much prefer to work in admin but the money is crap"
Until the age of 15 I thought that a lady's wee came out of her bottom because she sat down when on the toilet.
"I have the email password of the man that bullied me at my last company. I often cancel his flight, restaurant, and hotel bookings on the days he travels. I heard from others still there it's sending him mental."
"A colleague told me they were thinking of going freelance, outlining their plans to make enough money to get by. I thought it was a terrible idea but told them to go for it because I found them irritating. They quit."
"A band guy who I had a MASSIVE crush on when I was a teen, recently slipped into my DMs. "
"We've had facetime dates, he wants to meet up for sex after lockdown."
"He's got a wife and kids, and I don't even find him that hot anymore but I'm still tempted to fulfil my teenage fantasy"
"I work in a hospital, I've just had two weeks off sick, pretending I have Corona virus. I don't feel the slightest bit guilty, as I'll never get the chance to take two weeks fully paid no questions asked off sick ever again."
"Bus driver working through COVID-19. While everyone is worried about their lives being disrupted, mine's fine. I'm still working full time, and rarely went out anyway. Bonus, next to no passengers. I always said we could run an on time service without them, and we have now!"
"I once shoved a banana up my arse when I was about 13 to see what it felt like. The banana went all the way in. I had to shit it out, and I panicked when it wouldn't flush, so I did the only logical thing. I washed it off and put it back in the family fruit bowl."
"Used to work in a music wholesalers and often did the ordering. I'd always sneakily add on some extra LPs that I'd like myself. If they sold, great, extra sales. If they didnt sell, months later I got to write them down as Aged Stock and quietly buy them myself mega cheap"
I'm considering faking mild Covid so my lazy stepchildren will have to stay at their dumbass Mum's house for 14 days.

The old lady that lives next door to me stands in her garden gossiping loudly to her other neighbour while I'm trying to sleep after a night shift. One day I drenched her with a bucket of water out of the window and claimed I was after a cat.
"On a train going to London to bid for a contract, I realised the guy behind me talking on a phone was pitching for the same contract. He agreed a bid price with his boss on the phone, I undercut by £20K and we got the deal."
"When I was 13, my brother picked me up from the school bus in the tractor. On the drive home, we were fighting and he crashed into a ditch. We told our father that the steering broke. He sued the tractor company and won. The tractor company could not pay and went out of business."
I had a paper round when I was 14. One of the customers used to also order 'Nude Readers Wives' every month that I delivered with his paper. I say delivered but I actually used to steal it and cut out the pictures & sell them for £1 each at school. He never complained. Sorry ...
I have Senior managerial position at a leading UK university. I spend every lunchtime huffing aerosol deodorants. I go through about 10 a week. My afternoons aren't very productive...
"I used to hire video games from the local shop. When I hired Metal Gear Solid, I loved it so much I kept it. We incurred fines, I told my dad they made a mistake, he fought it & we never paid. Soon the shop closed down. I wonder how many kids like me contributed to its downfall."
"Came home blind drunk after a night out, spotted the old couple across the road had done up their garden with nice flowers and bushes. I remembered when the old bastard put a knife through my football many years before, so decided to rip every single plant out."
"I once took a guy home and when we got down to it, discovered that his penis was so small it almost wasn't there. I was so shocked I asked him to leave and now I worry about lasting damage I could have caused his ego."
"After taking a load of MDMA and ketamine once, I genuinely thought that the band The Shamen somehow knew all the secrets of the universe, life, the afterlife and the soul. Like they'd genuinely been informed by a higher power or something and the messages were in their music."
"I once, accidentally, ate another kids lunch in Primary School because we had the same lunchbox - a silver 'Monster Inc.' one. It was a great lunch, and from then on I started accidentally mixing up our lunchboxes every day. I really appreciated the extra sandwiches."
"When I was unemployed in the 90s I used to get up at the same time as Euro Quiz Going for Gold hosted by Henry Kelly was on tv. I used to knock one out thinking about some of the more attractive contestants, at the same time trying not to think about Henry Kelly"
I need some advice - my housemate leaves shit marks all over the toilet. And I'm too nice to say anything. How difficult is it for someone to use a toilet brush. What would you do/ say?
I stole someone else's hose connector down the allotments because I thought someone had stolen mine. The next day I found mine in my watering can. Now I have two hose connectors as I want his as a spare in case someone steals mine.
"I once broke up with a girlfriend, because she had untidy handwriting. I thought this must mean that she was a messy person and probably unhygienic. I'm writing this having not showered for 3 days and can smell my balls without bending down."
I enjoy popping spots so much that I actually put grains of sand in my pores to make them come up. Sooooo satisfying when you get the pus out all in one lump...
"When we get a takeaway I often sneak on some extra sides, starters etc. I tell my wife they must be 'free gifts' from the restaurant. She hasn't clicked that they're always things she doesn't like but I do."
"In an old job, I was in charge of a Hotel's food store. One of the regular stock items was always a catering pack of 48 four finger Kit-Kats. I really wanted a bar one day but it was easier to 'disappear 'the entire box than to explain why one bar was missing from the pack."

I gave an amazon review for an exercise/yoga mate I haven't yet used and probably never will. I'm overweight
"When I have to produce reports for work, I will spend a couple of hours before publication increasing the font size of some letters to spell out swear words, in the hope that people will subconsciously pick up on them."
I work on a tech support phone line. I know nothing about tech or computers I google all their questions and read out the answers word for word.
When listening to music I like to imagine I'm in the band playing to an audience containing people I know. They no longer make jokes about me but cheer. In reality I'm in my 40s and I've never played a musical instrument in my life.
"As a grad student in the 90s, found 100g pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine in the chemicals cupboard, leftover from a behavioural exp. Split three ways, cut with glucose, partied the decade away as only needed 30mg for a high. Tenured position in a university now"
"Me and my girl had an argument and I couldn't leave and go home because it was late, so I slept in her living room. I'm not into guys, but I was drunk and horny. I downloaded Grindr and fucked a stranger upstairs neighbour on her sofa after she fell asleep. We made up in th..."
Fucked a guy outside a nightclub once. Went back in and he left. I pulled another guy so went back to his place and fucked him. The next morning I tried to leave without anyone knowing. His dad caught me sneaking out. He turned out to be the guy I fucked outside.
I signed up to my own Netflix account so my family won't know I'm watching 50 shades of grey.
Walking home from the pub I cross a motorway flyover. If there's no-one around I sometimes pee over the edge and try to hit a car.
"My wife buys comfort conditioner for our clothes washing, I hate it, the smell gives me a headache. I pour it down the sink instead of using it when I put a wash on."
I used to work at a listings magazine. There was a monthly Greek folk night featuring a bouzouki performance. And every month I'd say it would actually feature a selection of traditional tunes played on a bazooka. No one noticed and it went to print every time.
Went out drinking with a pal and got so fucked I have no idea what happened. Pretty sure we fell out because of my actions and none of my pals have contacted me since so I'm assuming its bad. Too anxious to contact anyone and find out what I did.
"Before dropping of a hire car, I always tune the car radio presets to the same station."
I hate vegetables. The only way to get my five a day in is by 'hiding' veg in my meals like a toddler. I purée cabbage into curry or tomato soup for example. I am 36.
I regularly take more annual leave than I am allowed by simply putting days off in people's calendars rather than by submitting a request. Last year I took 45 days off and have an allowance of 25 days. I'm already on track to beat it this year.
I'm so fed up with my partner's obsession with his phone. It feels like his phone is 'the other woman'.
I've not played SimCity for a week. I think the residents might all be dead.

"In my last year of school, the new IT teacher said I was ugly in front of the whole class, so I stole his car keys and chucked them in the stream on the way home. It was Friday and he couldn't get home and had to have all the locks changed on his rented house. Still feel bad."
I used to tell my children that old alarm censors in our rooms were CCTV cameras and I could replay footage to make sure they'd been behaving themselves when I was out of the room. Was three years before they twigged.
A coke dealers funeral rapidly turned into coke/mdma madness. I ended up having sex with his grieving girlfriend and in bed with her for 3 days straight. I don't feel that bad about it really. He was a very cool guy but I always wanted to fuck his girlfriend and he was dead so...
My partner doesn't make me cum. And has just stopped trying to. It's making me love him less.
I was in the background during the filming in London of a popular 90s detective series. No idea if I ended up on camera but paranoid to this day that my parents will see me in it - as I was smoking a fag and they didn't know
My last dog was a poo eater. She'd just had a mouthful when a fellow dog walker came to say hello. Dog jumped up and nosed him. Left a piece of shit on his cheek. I didn't tell him.
I fart into my hand and throw it into my cat's face. He always looks so betrayed
"Sometimes I put clean cutlery back in the dishwasher rather than putting it away, just because it's easier."
I'm sick of the NHS worship. We just went for a family cycle and my daughter asked what the rainbow pictures were and could we do one for the front of our house. I said it was for when someone inside had died of the virus.
I'm a late 40s married man. I regularly scour the internet and social media for my ex from 30 years ago. I can't find her I think she may have passed away and it makes me sad.
When I've finished cutting my toenails I save myself 1 of the cut offs for a little chew on.
I don't fully understand how Venetian blinds work.
Whenever I use the strimmer I pretend I'm Vasquez from Aliens and do a few smartgun moves before getting to work. When my wife caught me doing it I explained that it's a special warm-up routine landscapers use.
Got blocked by one of my favourite people on Twitter - DaftLimmy - a while back for saying he smells of eggy farts.
I once had to finish off two baby birds the neighbours' vile devil-cat had pulled out of the nest. I drowned one and brained the other with a hammer; the pair of them just sat passively waiting to die. It was fucking horrible and I still cry about it now.
"My cats love nothing more than to sit on the washbasket in the bathroom, which is right next to me as I go to the toilet. It's rare this doesn't happen. Sometimes I make them little scarves out of loo roll."
I always favour visually unattractive job applicants over good looking ones to ensure I could never possibly fancy them down the line. Keeps things professional.

I'm not religious but got into habit of praying to God for safety of my family when my son was born 2 yrs ago. Prayer has got longer and I don't want to do it but it's become a superstition & am worried bad things will happen if I stop. What can I do?
I work in a car repair shop and if we get customers who talks to us like shit. We get some maggots of the lad who's a fisherman and put them in their car for them to hatch in flies.
"Mind numbingly drunk, I once mistook a friend's washing machine door for the toilet and took a shit. The following morning I told his girlfriend it was him as he had been in a dreadful state. So hazy was his memory, he admitted it must have been him."
"On the way home after a heavy Saturday night drinking session we grabbed a stack of Sunday newspapers off the local shops doorstep. The following week we did the same, replacing them with the previous weeks editions"
I have a secret folder on my phone filled with pictures of tractors
Seeing all these ladies walking around in latex gloves at the minute is highly arousing. Whenever I come back from shopping I'm so fired up that my wife and I are having the best sex of our marriage. Every cloud has a silver lining...
"I grew up on a fairly rough estate that had a beautiful boating lake at one end. One summer, the miniature boating club had a summer bbq and on display was a huge ornate, wooden American steam boat. We all waited till it passed us at the bottom end and bricked it till it sunk."
I've had the pleasure of living on my own for a number of years now. I experience a wonderful sense of freedom every time I shit with the bathroom door open. It really is the small things in life.
My upstairs neighbour has started angrily banging on the floor when I practice my violin. Now when I leave the flat I put on a solo violin playlist just to keep him entertained.
When I worked on Doctor Who they had rented a pub for a week as a filming location and John Barrowman showed me the secret room they had found where the pub landlord kept his extensive collection of Nazi memorabilia.
I continue to purchase a lot of items from Amazon even though I know they treat their staff terribly. It makes my life easy and the rest does not bother me.
My other half has no idea I've had a procession of dark web deliveries during isolation and have a cheeky microdose here and there when she's being unbearable
"Since i was young, all of my friends always looked up to me as the 'tough one' of the group. Reputation spread and i became a local hardman. I have never been in a fight, just big and scary looking despite being a softie."
"All of my friends think i have a very large member. Dont know where the rumour come from, I'm distinctly average."
"Lost my virginity in my mothers Vauxhall Tigra. Im 6ft 2, and the girl was a big lass. Still the best sex I've had to this day."
"I reported a bus stop sign that was installed parallel to the street, instead of perpendicular as they usually are. It was rotated as a result, but I now realise that it was put in the wrong way around for a reason. It now blocks a traffic camera being accessed for maintenance."
i experienced one of those porn like situations and genuinely had sex with my step mum. My dad disowned me and removed me from his will

I refuse to own a toaster. I always toast bread under the oven grill. My kids hate me.
"I recruit for a sales company. We aren't exactly legit. We have a high staff turnover. You have to be a bit thick and gullible to work on the floor. I check potential recruits twitter. If they're pro-brexit, pro-boris or pro-trump, that's a good sign they're right sort of dumb."
"After uni, my mate and his gf split up. She begged me to arrange a reconciliation. He wanted it too. I liked him better single and ignored. He has been married twice, her once. Both unhappy. 20 years on, I still think about the kids they might have had and happiness I denied."
Some friends of mine have live in a big house and have people clean for them and employ nannies. They also palm their kids off on grandparents most weekends. During lockdown they are suddenly having to everything themselves and look after their kids. I find this highly amusing.
"As a 6 yo in primary school, I wrote the word shit on the playground in large letters in some chalk left by builders, to show the other children I could spell it- I had to spend the afternoon washing it off but I'm still proud of myself this day"
I once tried on a finger trap whilst in a novelty gift store and couldn't get it off. I was too embarrassed to tell a member of staff so elected to steal it by discretely walking out with it still on my fingers.
I'm secretly ruining a pan my mum brought by immediately running it under the cold tap when it's red hot.
"I hate it, it's a terrible pan & I'm resentful as she didn't buy the one I recommend."
I justified to my parents that watching the late night French Films on TV when I was young helped my French studies. I think they believed me
"Whenever I visit the beach for the day and need a poo, I will simply go for a swim and shit it out. Even if there are toilets nearby. It's also quite convenient to clean my bum."
Back in the early eighties I had a wank driving an empty coach along the M4.
"Installed and administered an email system in the mid 90's for a publishing company. There was no security on the mailboxes so I regularly had a look at their content. Never realised but a bunch of misbehaving, unfaithful deviants I was working with."
"Whenever people ask me to take a photo of them, I change to front camera and take a selfie before doing one shot as requested."
"I keep dreaming this detailed scenario whereby I have a business meeting where it all comes out as a scandal that they invented red pepper houmous first, then they removed the red pepper and discovered plain houmous. Why?"
"At Uni I lived in halls with a payphone, one digit different from CoOp dairy. All early calls were unhappy customers. We'd say CoOp Dairy & get my milk's wrong. We'd ask the address & say sorry, your wife is too fat or your house is a slum: fck off. Hours of fun!"
"In 2005, a journalist pal game me Chris Waddle's mobile number. I used to ring him, pissed, on the way home from nights out and shout Diamond Lights you cunt. Dunno if it ever connected or just went to voicemail."
I once paid for a fish supper for a diabetic girl on twitter that had lost her benefits. Felt sorry for her. Turns out the girl ended up being a 50 something fat bloke that was just hungry.
I once answered the phone to a wrong number. A very irate man asked me what I was doing in his house. I said I was shagging his wife and was there a problem? I always wondered what happened when he got home.

I once lived next door to feuding neighbours. For 4 years I had anonymous notes sent to each of them to escalate their feud. Both used to tell me what the other was doing to them and how it was driving them crazy. Always wondered it they twigged as it all stopped when I moved.
"I enjoy pressing the button at zebra crossings when their are no cars about, crossing. Then look back in delight when a pile of cars have to stop at a red light."
"Once dogsat where the dog died. Owners were out of country, told me to get it cremated. Put the poor bastard in a sports bag and jumped on the tube. Took my eye off it and someone nicked the bag and jumped off at next stop. Never told the owners what actually happened."
"At my interview with PWL in 1989, I was sent to wait in the Missile Room, which contained an Exocet Missile, and Kylie Minogue, who was waiting to record. I smoked at least three cigarettes before going in and getting the job. Did I give her cancer? Hope not."
"Self-isolating with parents, little sister and 2 cats. Family rule is anyone who finds cat vomit, clean it up. I may have left a juicy pile festering for 3 days because it was next to my sister's chair and I knew she would be the, ahem, first, to spot it. She was."
In Secondary School my form tutor used to start over again whilst taking the register if anyone spoke or made noise. I used to wait for him to nearly get to the end then shout Start Again! I still think I'm hilarious for it to this day.
If we shared a house at university it was me that stole some cheese. Me.
When I first met my partner via online dating I lied and said I was 10 years younger than I am. 4 years down the line they still think I am and I don't know how to dig myself out of this hole.
My partner thinks I drink too much. To appease her I drink Heineken 0.0 during the week. I secretly add a shot of vodka to each glass and it tastes almost like normal Heineken.
"When I wee, I like to see how many laps of the bowl I can do without splashing the water."
"Until about a year ago, I thought the Dalai Lama was some kind of spiritual animal. Turns out it's not."
Had a video call with my team at work. My fully nude 2 year old daughter kept coming in and was clearly visible. Not sure if I've broken any laws
Just found an Easter egg in the garden that the kids didn't find. Nearly 2 weeks in the weather. Tasted fine.
I dream of quitting my job just so I can delete the people I work with from my social media as they annoy the fuck out of me.
Anytime my girlfriend doesn't hear me properly and asks me to repeat myself it annoys me so I repeat it slightly quieter in order to make her listen harder. Now I've seen it written down I think I'll stop doing that.
The customer is never right. Years spent in customer support and pricks still try and goad us with Law so-and-so says my rights are X. You really think the Terms and Conditions set out by a big corp would slip up on simple laws? You make my job a misery.
I started a new job today. Some people were asking about one of my eyes that's bloodshot and red. I said I didn't know what it was but in actual fact I accidentally jizzed in my eye while having a wank last night.

"I was walking behind Telly Savalas on the Kings Road in the 80s when I noticed him drop a full pack of Marlboro from his pocket. I picked them up, kept them and smoked the lot like the teenage skank i was"
"I haven't spoken to my dad in a decade. He's toxic. But sometimes I drive the 30-odd miles to his house and sit in the car, hoping to catch a glimpse of him."
"I've realined my 5 minute weekly wank to 7:55 Thursday evening. My ejaculation, coinciding with the NHS applause, considerably amplifies my crescendo."
"I continue to blow on the inside of the game cartridges, even though, the black bold print warns me not to"
At 4 weeks into the lockdown & at no point has my supply of narcotics been interrupted. Drug dealers should be involved in planning for future crises.
"I used to work at Buckingham Palace. One day after work, on the way back from the pub I popped into the Palace to roll a spliff, as it was the most convenient place to do so."
When we built our house the land we marked out for the garden was twice what we bought from the company that owned it. They never noticed and that was 18 years ago.
18 months since passing my driving test and I still have no freakin' idea what to do at crossroads.
"If I won the lottery I'd disappear. I wouldn't tell anyone and just leave all my family behind, including my child and dickhead dog"
Since the Covid-19 lockdown I have spent an unhealthy amount of time writing highly charged and increasingly depraved homoerotic slash fiction featuring former Premier League manager Alan Pardew. I am not gay nor do I support any of the teams he has previously managed.
Since lockdown and working from home I have glass of wine with lunch. Not sure I will be able to face my job sober when we are back in the office.
"I engaged the services of a witch doctor to put a revenge spell on my abusive, cheating ex and paid £100 for the privilege. I still don't consider it a waste of money."
When I change the batteries on a remote control I pretend I'm loadng a shotgun
I love leaving a spot until it matures and squeezing the almost dry puss out of it like silly string.
"Planned a weekend of debauchery in London over the festive period. Invited 2 different guys round on consecutive nights, not together, I'm not an animal. Got down there, got flu, became too ill to travel home so instead spent Christmas in a Travelodge like Alan Partridge."
Asked my girlfriend not to wear heels when we're out together because it makes her slightly taller than me. The reality is I couldn't give a fuck but she can't walk in them and it's embarrassing having to constantly catch her when she trips over.

"On my stag do last year we bumped into a hen party in the same hotel & then saw them out that night. I got talking to the bride as we had something in common. We had sex that night & it was pretty good, the lads still talk about how fit she was & I can't even brag about it."
A hooker once asked me if was cold outside after seeing my dick. After that I couldn't get a boner. Mortified. Since then I try fluff it up a bit before anyone sees it.
I'm living with my ex whilst our house is being sold. He cheated on me constantly for 4 years and made me feel like shit. I have started getting my own back. Yesterday I stuck my finger up my bum after taking a shit and rubbed it all over his dinner before serving it.
"I used to hate my roommate so much that I took a dump, then baked it to dry it out, I then grated it into his jar of ground coffee. I spent the next 2 weeks watching him drink my shit!"
I find it weird looking at chimpanzees .. can't help just think it's a person in a costume - I also have a degree in animal behaviour

I buy my brother-in-law a birthday and Xmas present every year he doesn't get me anything. Really angry about it. Would look too odd if I just stopped.

"For about 4 years I would regularly stay up all night smoking crack, go straight into my senior, well paid office job the next morning and do fuck all - no one knew. My life is now in ruins of course."

"Boyfriend asked me to cut his shoulder length hair as cannot go to barber. Overconfidently, I accidentally gave him a bob and now he looks like a middle aged woman. I feel so bad for him but laugh every time I look at him. I'm too scared to cut it shorter in case I make it worse"

About 6 years ago I met a girl on Tinder. After having sex I came inside her and ghosted her shortly after. About 6 weeks later she messaged me again and I ignored it. Everyday I wonder if she was messaging to tell me she was pregnant and I now have a 5 y/o kid I don't know about

"When shopping, I enjoy slipping small items like mini chocolate bars, or small toys with barcodes on them, into people's pockets— hoping they'll set off the alarm when they checkout; and get shamed by shoppers and shop staff... Less schadenfreude, more shoppinfreude."
I have realised during the lockdown that I'm even more of a loner than I previously realised. I'd be quite happy not to have to see/speak to anyone bar my wife & kids for months.
I'm bored of my life. If it wasn't for my kids I would have fucked off years ago. My mates wife is desperate to fuck me and even though I don't fancy her I might do it just to blow it all up.
"Like most of the UK, I've recently realised that if it wasn't for the drive to work and breathing on work colleagues we'd get absolutely hammered every day. Pray for my liver"
I skip straight to the LATER YEARS AND DEATH section of just about every person's Wikipedia entry I look up

"I ordered an expensive turntable from Amazon. When it arrived, the box looked the wrong shape. Turns out they delivered two. Sent one back for a full refund."

I block people who tweet nice things
Everytime my housemate makes toast he butters it on the sideboard; not even a plate or a breadboard. I collect the crumbs and throw them in his bedroom. He's such a messy idiot he never notices. I wish he'd die.

I don't like my husband. I regularly imagine that he has died and that I'm a widow. I then mentally play out the conversations I would have at the funeral in my mind and think of how sorry everyone would feel for me.
Almost every time I go out drinking with my boyfriend I shit myself on purpose. I'm not incontinent I just want to put him off anal sex by making him think he's over-stretched my arsehole. So far it's worked every time. I'll dump him soon I expect.
"My wife thinks I've started running every day to take my government-mandated exercise, but really it's so I'm in better shape to start dating again when we get our inevitable divorce once lockdown is over."

"To ensure I used the right number of characters I typed out a fesshole confession as a tweet, then forgot & just tweeted it. Only realising my error when it started getting likes. That's the story of how I told the world about the time I shat watery shit up my own back in p..."
I was once minding my nephew while my missus & his mam went shopping. I had a massive hangover & I could smell he needed a nappy change. When I opened it the smell was horrific & I threw up on his head. He was going crazy but got him cleaned up before they got home & never told
"I once saw Terry Waite's penis and it's enormous. Wholly innocent scenario - adjacent urinals, Waterloo Station gents, 2001-ish. But given anything more than a semi he'd have someone's eye out with it. Like a tin of Pledge with an apple on top ... still think of it sometimes."

"I can't afford anything in it but always buy every issue of What Hi-Fi and Stuff magazine just so I can entertain myself for macabre lolz reading the descriptions of its £3000 iPhones, £25K stereos etc because they sound like the monologues Patrick Bateman makes before a murder"
"When 17 y.o. I was offered a threesome at a party with two very fit girls, both older than me. I had a girlfriend then, & even tho I had been planning on breaking up with her for weeks, I declined their offer. I know it was the good thing to do, but holy christ I regret it now"
"When I was a young kid I tried some sexual stuff w/ another kid. Nothing proper, just sort of rubbing. We grew up & that was it, end of. But to this day the thought haunts me. I feel like a monster, yet I did nothing wrong. We were both young & clueless, so why do i feel so awful"
"A lad I work with got a job that I unsuccessfully applied for. I wasn't happy, so I got in touch with Northern Rail as he was bragging about having a fake train pass. They pulled him, found the fake ticket and fined him £3,500. I don't feel bad at all."

I only clap for the NHS at 8pm on a Thursday because I don't want my neighbours to think I'm a total cunt.
Whenever I pop a pimple in front of the mirror I always check the glass after for any pus spray. There's some good marks on there and I find it very satisfying.
"I line my cat's litter tray with the local newspaper's sports page facing upwards showing my rival team's players or manager whenever possible. A pathetic, small-minded act of non-revenge but it gives me inner satisfaction to see the soiled end-product."

I used to go on netmums and post things like is it ok to give my 1 year old Coca-Cola?/fruit shoots?/whisky in their bedtime bottle? Just for shits n giggles. It was like throwing a hand grenade into a cesspool.

As part of my job I'm on a rota to clean down a DNA-exam room once a week. We have to take swabs at regular intervals to prove the room is DNA clean. I've never once cleaned it. I use the time to have a break and then just sign the paperwork. It's never failed it's swab test.
I use to sell my piss for £10 a sample to heroin users. They gave me their methadone meds to take so that they can pass the test. Lucky I never got addicted. I can't have Night Nurse in green liquid form anymore because of how similar it looks to the methadone.
"When I was a teenager, my girlfriend used to give me sneaky handjobs under the cushions when we were watching TV. My dad made a comment recently that made me realise we weren't as subtle as we thought. I am filled with horror and a deep sense of regret."
"My parents are right wing casual racists who blame minorities for everything. I'm very much the opposite, and spent my formative years arguing. However, now when we chat, because they're so highly strung and depressed, I just agree with them, and sometimes even prod them along."
Sometimes I pluck the hair from my asshole and I'm afraid one day I'll pluck the wrong hair and it'll be attached to my spinal chord and I'll be paralysed from the waist down.
I once saw guy doing coke in my local’s toilets so grassed him up and got him kicked out even though I was doing it myself at the time. I just didn't like the prick.

New girlfriends kids are total assholes. Spoiled entitled wasteful pricks the lot of them. But I'm stuck paying for the bastards and picking up their shit daily.
I've spent the past 3 or 4 weeks shitfaced. I dare not have a day without drinking at least half a bottle of brandy or whisky. I fear the binmen are going to report me for having parties but it really is just me. I go out for food so I can buy drink.
I look away when an expensive sports car passes me because I don't want to give the driver the satisfaction.
"Phone rang, she wanted to speak to Jerry. I know no Jerry, she must have dialed the wrong number. I said You just missed him, his fiancee came by and they went out to celebrate their anniversary. She snarled I'm his fiancee and hung up. I wonder what became of them."
"Almost every day, I report Donald Trump's tweets on twitter. Pointless and futile, I know."
I shit blood now and again for the last 25 years. Recent tests say that my liver is fine though I am a heavy drinker. Worried but then I have a drink.
"Whenever we sit down watch the TV my other half takes it as a cue to do literally anything else, coming back an hour or so later suggesting that we start it over so they can 'catch up'. The sheer contempt for my time is driving me insane."
"I get a small amount of satisfaction knowing most of the slim, beautiful girls who would never date me thirty years ago are now frumpy, fat and middle aged just like me."
I've never watched any of the daily coronavirus press briefings and never will. There are some things a man just can't stomach.

I'm already missing quarantine. Socially distancing meant that my mental health was the best it'd been in years.

Me and my girlfriend play a game every day where we guess the amount of deaths from coronavirus in the UK in the last 24 hours before the press release and see who comes closest. It's the most fun we've ever had in lockdown
I once got ready for a night out at a friend's house. He was 30 and still lived with his mum. When I went to the bathroom for some reason I took a peak in the second bedroom and found that there was no spare bed... He was sharing a bed with his mum. We haven't spoken since.
"Lockdown has screwed up my towel washing schedule. Usually I get a nice clean towel every week in Travelodge, take it home, use it for the week and exchange next time I'm there. Now I've had to wash my own towels. Bloody Covid19!"
When in lockdown I shave my head I pretend to be a spy on the run changing my appearance. Or an out of shape Demi Moore in G.I. Jane. Whichever. I'm 40.
I have become so bored during lockdown that I inspected my pubic hair closely enough to notice that one of them hadn't got the memo about only growing so far. It's twice as long as the rest.
As a teenager I had the attic room with eaves storage. Could never be bothered to go downstairs to pee. When we moved the new owners must have found the 100 or so bottles of old piss that I'd stashed in the eaves. But they never mentioned it

I work for a local housing office and get a large number of people who come in clearly told what to say to get priority. So when I hear You have a duty of care... I change their details so that their application gets lost.
I was on the YTS in the 80s. Used to get shitfaced and use my office key to gain access to the petty cash for a curry on the way home. Fuck 'em and their £38.50 a week.
I'm starting to get really pissed off with my missus. Whenever we're watching TV if she's browsing social media and clicks on a video she always plays the video full blast. She never turns it down and it's really starting to piss me off.
"One Friday night in a packed O'Neills pub, some mates & I did a team-steal on 4 large wall-mounted Guinness toucan heads. Snuck them out under our coats. 7 or so years later I sold them all on eBay to a Japanese Guinness collector for over £800."

"In 1995 I spent time in Boston, USA on a number of occasions I was taken to authentic Irish bars, where I felt pressured into donating for the IRA collections."
When the Boston bombing happened my first thought was they got a tiny taste of what they'd be funding all these years
"I find people talking about what box sets they're watching painfully dull. Very few people are able to elaborate on something beyond Oh, it's really good! and it bores the tits off me. I'm at the point where I pretend not to watch TV at all to avoid the conversation."
When I was at high school I used to steal pens out of people's blazers in my class. When they needed a pen I'd sell it back to them for 50p.
My wife reminds me of Mrs Lucas from the Adrian Mole books.
"When I was a 6th former we had to do duties I was assigned lost property. In a dingy cellar I redistributed the wealth, giving branded trainers, uniform & sportswear to the poor kids who'd lost their pumps. Fuck those rich ungrateful twats who didn't even know they'd lost stuff."
10 years ago I edited Roy Hodgson's Wikipedia page to falsely say that he speaks four languages and reads Martin Amis. It got picked up by the media when he became England manager and he evidently hasn't since felt the need to deny it.
"Age 10 on holiday with my parents, driving from Algarve to Lisbon. Five hour drive. I got bored and pulled my ballsack out the side of my shorts and stretched it down my leg. After five minutes of this I looked up to see my dad shaking his head at me in the rear view mirror."
My wife likes 3 sweeteners in her tea. If we've not had sex for a while I only give her 2. She doesn't notice but I win my own little victory
I once made a cup of tea for David Cameron and I didn't wipe my cock around the rim. To this day I regret this. Sorry.
Until last week I thought 1991 novelty hit single I'll Be Back by Arnee and the Terminators was actually the official Terminator soundtrack by action movie legend Arnold Schwarzenegger himself and not a project done for laughs by various BBC Radio DJs
Me and my wife are the same age. I'm ageing like Richard Madeley whereas she went full Judy Finnegan years ago. It's like being married to my gran.
"I jet washed my driveway today, It gave me equal amounts of satisfaction and shame. Satisfaction of a job well done; Shame that I'd been reduced to taking pride in the trappings of such bourgeois suburbanism."
My ex was REALLY into Pokémon and asked me to dress up as Misty for him. I eventually I agreed but didn't realise that he'd be dressed as a Charizard. Weirdest fuck EVER.

"I have spent the majority of my life believing the toilet seat was for girls. Despite my latest partner clueing me into the truth two years ago, it's all I've known. so I still don't put the seat down when I go for a poo, even now."
Every Easter I have this weird habit of going into stores and secretly snapping the necks of chocolate Easter bunnies. I do it to every one I see and then leave them sat on their shelves. I'm an Easter Bunny serial killer.
"Over the last week of my old job I secretly stuffed seventy frozen hamburgers, three-hundred rashers of frozen bacon and fifty frozen chicken burgers from the freezer into my work bag. I celebrated starting my new job with the biggest BBQ ever!"
I modded The Guardian's Comment is Free for 4 years. It was easy to find out who anon people were if they registered with work emails. A few employers received untraceable emails if I thought their employee's comment was dodgy. One junior academic lost their contract. No regrets.
"I the skin off brie and bin it. I love the cheese, but can't stomach the idea of eating mould."
Been drinking way too much during lockdown and went for a run and needed an alco poo and had to drop my shorts and go on the side of a main road. Luckily there were no cars but I have to run past it every run now
"When someone posts a social media message about a friend or relative that's died or critically ill and they've made a spelling or grammatical error, I have an overwhelming urge to correct them."
When I was a kid my dad used that powder toothpaste and I used to spit huge greenies in it and roll them around into little balls

I'm a 33 year old man and I cry when I watch the original Lion King with my 2 year old son. It really gets me when Simba talks to mustafa in the clouds..
"I lead a team of IT nerds. One of them I just did not like. I kept telling him to move on and up to better things. I used to send him job ads. Eventually, I got a ref check and he got a much better job. He gave me a $120 bottle of wine and called me his mentor. Fuck."
"Our 1 yr old is currently terrorising everything in our house. Although I've strapped the TV down to stop it falling, I've made sure she can push it backwards to destroy it so I can justify getting a new and better tv"
I just found a dead rat in my garden. The guy who's garden backs onto ours is a miserable sod who hates wildlife so I got it on a shovel and flicked it over his fence.
I've stopped saying I don't want kids and started saying we can't have kids and it's amazing how much less of a complete arsehole everyone is about it
I can't piss unless I pull out my smartphone and get on Twitter. It feels unnatural not to now.

"When someone CCs someone senior into an email in the hope of speeding up a response I always ignore it for 24 hours to prove I can. If they follow that up with another mail chasing, I wait until the following week, and in that reply I will deliberately misspell their name."
"I work in a office that's is built around an atrium, I often look at the balconies and think I could easily jump that I then Imagine how everyone would react to me falling down down down to the floors below."
I have no wish to kill myself I just feel the call of the void.
"I'm vegan but every now and then I buy a bag of Tesco grated mozzarella and eat it like a bag of crisps. I don't even know why; it's not especially nice, and mozzarella's one of the few cheeses there's decent plant-based analogues of."
Set up a chargeable after-school club with a mate but instead of renting a sports hall he spent all the cash on paying off Britannia Video Club debts. After parent complaints we were ordered to see our head of year but he had a stroke over the weekend and no-one followed up.
My partner's son claims his cat is really large and it's not. It's a normal sized cat and it's getting to me.
I have a complex about my small boobs so I joined an online group that fetishised them as a way of making myself feel better. I ended up sleeping with six members of the group because they were so enthusiastic about my lack of big tits.
"When I was 8, me and my younger brother bought a fake dog turd from the joke shop, put it on the kitchen floor, my dad found it and kicked fuck outta the dog, I still feel bad to this day, 32 years later!"
"Once lived with someone who NEVER did any housework. One day of much frustration, I decided to use his toothbrush to clean his shit stains from the toilet. Karma got me back though, as he had diarrhoea after that, and it fucking stank."
Stopped going for shits now I'm not working in the office. Only go when I'm desperate. What's the point? Can't enjoy it
I had to stop dating a girl because her fringe reminded me of Joe Exotic from Tiger King
"I've written a book on veganism, that I regularly use to kills wasps with. Bastards."
"As the quiet queer boy at school, I got called poof etc a lot by one lad and others joined in. School = not fun. Balanced things out by signing him up to a Sunday paper book group. A copy of the 'Joy Of Gay Sex' in his name at his parents' house seemed to stop his cunty nonsense."
I ordered an Apple laptop and scanner. The scanner broke during delivery. I messaged apple to report the problem and they mistakenly sent me another laptop. I pleaded ignorance to their messages and sold the laptop to my brother for his design degree for the price of a scanner

"I text controversial opinions - not always my own - into radio shows, knowing they're more likely to get read. I say I'm Jim from Norwich. I'm not Jim and I've never been to Norwich."
Sometimes in Zoom meetings I stick blue tack on the faces of people I don't like
"I met a girl on Tiinder, when chatting she said she liked to 'experiment with layers of taboo', assuming this meant anal or I'd tie her up I arranged to meet. Turns out she wanted me to pretend I was her dad and had drugged her. Still went through with it though, because I was..."
I am a church Vicar but I no longer belive in God and I just carry on for the money and job security.
"Being the only Dutch guy at my school, naturally all the kids wanted to buy drugs of me. So many asked me I actually bought some weed and mixed it with leaves, oregano and cookie crumbs and sold it as prerolled joints. They contained like 10% weed tops. Bought me my first car."
"I love my rescue hamster so much, I've probably spent over £1000 trying to give him the best possible care. I'm going to be heartbroken when he passes away."
My wife insists on organic fruit and veg and using the local plastic free shop. I buy everything from the value range at our local supermarket and decant it into paper bags and reusable bottles and containers. Saves a fortune and she's none the wiser.
I'm a counsellor. People think I'm compassionate and can be trusted when most of the time I really don't give a fuck about their problems. I've made a good living out of not caring.
"When I was a kid I used to wash my dads brand new car, I regularly put the hosepipe up the exhaust and turned the water on, the car was constantly back in the garage to be fixed. I didn't realise what I had done until a few years ago when it randomly dawned on me."

"Enforced working from home with the wife and kids. Much as I love them, more and more of my daytime coffees are secretly getting a large tot of whisky added."
"The last thing I stole from a supermarket was an ironing board. I was very drunk and discombobulated as I tried to pass the damn thing through the self-service scanner. In the end, through sheer frustration, I just thought Fuck it! and walked out with it. At least I tried."
"I can't help but think less of people on Facebook, who, when something funny has been written and most people are responding with a laughing reaction, do a normal 'like'. Cold bastards."
"As a man, when using a public toilet, I'm always conflicted as to whether to leave the seat up, especially if someone is likely to use the toilet immediately after me: if I do leave it up, I'm inconsiderate; if I don't, it looks like I've just had a shit."
"When I worked in a pub if someone else who worked there came on on their time off they'd order a load of drinks on a round and we'd ring it through as a half of bitter - and vice versa. Had some banging nights for a couple of quid, never got rumbled."
"I would eat chips with every meal if I could. What stops me is the thought that if I did, nobody would want to have sex with me for all the resulting weight gain. Chips tho."

"For several years I worked in bars and clubs and on a busy Saturday, after about midnight when everyone was pissed, I'd give singles but charge for doubles to any dicks and pocket the difference. No guilt, just a silent fuck you"
"I'm paid a six-figure salary but I'm lazy and do barely any work, just surf the web all day. I've got away with this in a series of increasingly senior jobs. Sounds great but really I'm unfulfilled and seriously depressed."
"When I do my weekly grocery shop I regularly steal Lurpak butter because it's expensive but all the other butters are shit, and I always steal tampons. No-one should be paying for those."
I vote labour and supported Jeremy Corbyn but I have named the nappy bin Jeremy Poo Bin

As a young man my elderly neighbour put a knife in my football. In protest I climbed over her fence at night and did a shit on her lawn. As I made my exit her dog came out barking and when I looked around from my garden the dog was eating my poop
I'm enjoying the lockdown so much that I don't want the pandemic to end. My heart jumps when journalists ask the govt about an exit strategy in the 5pm briefings
My ex gave me back a load of clothes of mine that she'd worn/borrowed. I still haven't washed one of them because it smells exactly like her. I miss her.

"My old freeholder was a Despicable man, he made our life hell whilst renewing our lease, it cost us £24k in legal fees. I've held a personal vendetta against him ever since and grassed him up to the revenue, turns out I was right and he subsequently went bust. I'm so happy!"
My partner thinks I'm very good at putting the toilet seat down after peeing. In truth I'm not very good at lifting it up to begin with.

I had my first wet dream in years over Theresa May. I'm 46 and hate the Tories.
"Met up with a beautiful sylph-like woman I got to know via Twitter. In real life she looked like a middleweight boxer and at least 15 years older than her recent but heavily filtered photos. Still had sex of course, but thought of her attractive selfies the entire time."
"21 years old, shagged a student, no 'supplies', used clingfilm out of desperation."

When I first heard Hit the North by The Fall I thought they were shouting HITLER!
I used to rent VHS tapes from my local Blockbuster and copy 3 seconds of hardcore porn onto them at random points before returning them. I remember putting scat porn on Home Alone 2 and an ejaculating penis on Schindler's List. I had to stop when everything changed to DVD.

"When I was 12 & my sister was 15, I accidentally broke an ornament & blamed my sister. Dad was furious, pulled down her pants & spanked her in front of me. After I hid in my room & had a furious wank. I'm more ashamed I got off seeing her smacked than getting her in trouble."
"I'm an adult chat line operator, and this week someone called and played the piano and sang for me - and that was it. He said he hoped I enjoyed the music and wished me goodnight."
I let my 11 year old daughter use my Instagram account for a one-off project. Now loads of her friends have started following me and I feel like a nonce.

"I have 'odd' and 'even' days of the week. Monday's, Wednesday's and Friday's are odd. Tuesdays, Thursday's and Saturday's are even. Fuck knows what to do with Sunday's"
"I worked part time at M&S for years and during my 3rd year, I got my housemate a job there. We used to work in ops and had access to the warehouse including fridges. Waste always had to go in the bin even if edible, so we'd fill bags up every shift and then freeze it. We ate good"
"I've always worked and stayed the right side of the law. Now, in my 40's, I take pleasure in shoplifting. It could be the odd pack of gum in my pocket, a hand tool hidden between bags of compost or a magazine left in the child seat of a trolley.Fuck it."

"When I'm out for a run along the river, I look out for ditched dead bodies, in the hope I get the glory for finding one."
My favourite breakfast is Frosties with cheese. A slice of cheddar on the side after each mouthful. Not grated on top - I'm not an animal.

I quite often ignore or delete emails from people who put their crappy degree title in their email signature. Fuck off John Smith BA Hons Business Management. #Hons

I'm a bartender and I've taught my 11 year old kid how to make cocktails during this quarantine

We wrote our own wedding vows. My wife doesn't know I lifted the chorus of the Shakira song Suerte for mine.
"On a school trip to France, the queue for the toilet was far too long so I peed on a towel and hid it under my bed. The room stank of piss and I blamed it on my roomate, who was relentlessly bullied by the other kids for it."
I've worked from home for 3 years. I manage about 12 people's work. I've spent most of those 3 years playing PC games instead of working. I got a big bonus this year and a promotion for being a good manager. I don't feel guilty at all.
"Bf moving back to Oz living opp. London Fields/Hackney i took my leftover 12 bottles of cheap wine & 3/4 bottle absynth at night to where all the local derros get drunk every day. Next day they were all so smashed, shouting, fighting and falling over. It was quite a spectacle."

All I ever wanted when I was growing up was to work in the videogames industry. I've been in it for a decade now and in the last six years have become trapped on exclusively working on the worst kind of hypermonetized mobile garbage and honestly wish I'd never bothered.
I used to work away in the week so I used to turn one of the batteries in my exes rabbit vibrator the wrong way.
When I came home at the weekend I would check and she'd always turned it back and not said anything
A lot of my married friends are envious of me as I'm single and heavily involved in the swing and bdsm scene. Sex with many is often. But when I see pics of them with their wives and kids I have a cry. I want that more than anything. One person to love me and to have kids with.

"My husband thinks my period lasts 5 days, it only lasts 2, I enjoy the extra days of not being pestered for sex."
I've just started a new job. Told the powers that be I was really passionate about it and this helped me get it. Beat a lad I know who REALLY wanted it. Fact is I couldn't give a shit. I'm using it to get experience and as a stepping stone to what I actually want. Fuck him.

Lovers fiancé presented a live sports show on local radio. We'd listen to his show during sex to calculate how long we had together before he got home.
BTW: We get occasional moans about repeats. We don't repeat stuff. However people sometimes submit the same story multiple times written slightly differently. This can be hard to spot in moderation. Stop submitting the same stories multiple times ok? https://t.co/XBIRMFG4OF

My manager has a habit of making unannounced visits on our team. A couple of us got him drunk at the work night out and then fitted a concealed gps/gsm tracker to his car. The £6/month sim plan is worth it for some peace of mind.
"I was eating a bag of Wotsits, when I found a ping-pong ball sized ball of corn dust and cheese. The taste of pure unrefined cheese powder was so strong and satisfying, I can't stop thinking about it."

As a child I'd wait until I needed a poo so badly it was peeking out. I'd scrape some turd off under my fingernails then go into my little sister's room and smear it on the pages of her Ladybird books.
As I walk along I look through other people's windows. I've not seen anything interesting yet but I remain hopeful
"When I was 11 I was messing about with a lighter and deodorant can. I singed my eyebrows couldn't tell my mum the truth so I lied, said a man jumped out the bushes and burnt me with a deodorant can and lighter. She went crazy rang police/ radio every one was on the man hunt."

"I once gently but firmly urged a toddler in my daughter's nursery to return the chapstick she had taken from daughter. The child was verging on tears, but I insisted she do the right thing because stealing is wrong. I later discovered my daughter's own chapstick at home."
People have been buying me whiskey for birthdays and christmas for years. I can't stand the stuff. I pretend I like it. Wish I had the balls to say something but I literally have thousands of pounds spent on me and don't want to upset anyone.
"I always tell people at parties that I've never seen any James Bond films, so I appear edgy and cool. In reality, I've watched Moonraker, Live and Let Die, and really enjoyed Skyfall."

"Once, when I was stoned, I told the group I was with I put cold beans on toast and put them in the microwave to warm up as I was convinced that was how I did it. It wasn't. It still haunts me when I think about it."
I often visit those old phone boxes that have been repurposed as book swaps. I always take a few books that look interesting and promise myself I'll donate some at a later date. Haven't donated a single one yet. And I've not read many of those I've taken.

I have been topping up the super concentrated fabric softener with water for months and my other half hasn't noticed. In fact no one has noticed any difference to the fluffiness of their clothes
I used to regularly masturbate my grandad's sheepdog. I did it so often it destroyed his sheepdog training and all he did was run up to people and try to get them to wank him off. They eventually had him put down :

I got pissed the night before an A-level exam. Thought it started in afternoon but it was a morning exam. Missed it. My gran had died about 3 weeks before so I phoned college and said it had happened the night before. Got away with it and they used my predicted grade.
"I have large testicles. As a result, jeans only last me a couple of months before the friction from my gonads wears two holes clear through the crotch. Every time. It is a curse."

I'm a responsible recycler but when I'm washing my hands in a rest room with two air dryers I take a manic delight in sticking one hand under each.
Earwax. In any moment of solitude I think about the earwax that might be forming. I'm obsessed. I stick pointy objects in my ears to tease out more wax. If a big chunk comes out I play with it for hours and think about it all the time.
I've a single coarse hair that grows on ridge of my nose. I try to pluck it with finger nails but it is quite resilient. When I do catch hold of it & am able to pull it out it gives me so much joy. It grows back quickly too so I can enjoy the thrill again quite soon afterwards.
Until I had my first child I thought that at birth the midwife tied a knot in the umbilical cord to seal it off. I thought that innies and cuties were a result of how good they were at knot tying.

"Sometimes when I'm having to wait a while for the bathroom to be free, I wee in the bin in the kitchen. I live with my parents and brother and they know I do this, but despite them repeatedly telling me to stop, I haven't."
Every day when my husband goes to work I masturbate to lesbian porn.

My dog is 10 years old. I can't wait for him to die. I hate dogs and I'm never getting another one. The only thing I dislike more is people who love dogs.
I'm 32 and really boring/normal. People don't know this about me but can't figure out how to tie my shoelaces. Try to practice at least twice a year but I just can't figure it out. It's really embarrassing.
I've got 2 dogs. I like 1 of them & tolerate the other. The 1 I like always gets more food/treats. I ignore the other little twat.
My wedding has had to be cancelled due to the Coronavirus. I haven't been this happy in months.
I'm too ashamed to tell people that social isolating is no different to my normal boring and depressing lifestyle so instead I tell them it's a real struggle.
"Covid has saved my ass. My gf is 40 in 3 weeks. She was expecting big party & foreign holls. Never got round to sorting anything, couldn't be arsed really. Made bookings last week,so they got back to me cancelling. I've shown her those, she thinks I'm an angel for arranging!"

"I thought upon reaching manhood, men grew 2 extra testicles so they had 4. I used to worry that mine hadn't grown. I was well into my 20s before I found out this isn't the case."
"I was 13, argued with my dad because I came home late, went upstairs to my room crying and wished him dead. He died suddenly the next morning. 30 years later and I still blame myself. Whenever something bad happens to me, I know it's because of what I did that night."
I have our wedding photos on a USB stick and once a month I look through them. Not because I enjoy it. But because I tell my wife I remember every detail of our day as if it were yesterday and reel off memories my wife may have forgotten. It leads to sex every time.
I once had to speak to Nigel Farage due to work & had access to his personal details. I made a note of them & have since signed him up for every piece of shit marketing campaign that I can.
My first wank was over a picture of Minnie the Minx from the Beano. I'm in my 30s now but have to turn the telly off whenever Nicola Sturgeon comes on as she reminds me of the aforementioned comic book character and I don't want my wife to see my cartoon boner-mortis

I'm in deliveries and when there's no answer I have to write N/L - notice left - and the date on the parcel. Every time I do this I like to pretend I'm a famous person signing an autograph. I don't know why but it gives me a little buzz every time.
"I don't pick up dog shit! When walking my dog I carry a tied poo bag with a golf ball in it, I pretend to pick up in case anyone is watching then carry the weighted bag home. People who pick up dog shit are disgusting!"
"When I was just starting out living on my own I had no money for frivoulous stuff like cutlery. What I used to do was snaffle a knife, fork or spoon each time I was invited out to a cafe or restaurant. Managed to accrue enough for six place settings within a three month period."

I once found porn on my family computer. Started to get a semi then realised it was pictures of my mum and dad
"Brian, you've never made me cum."
Me and few mates where in shitty punk band. Bad with a capital B. Out of sympathy my mum asked if we would play a few 'party' songs at my little sis' 8th birthday. Gave us a few beers for doing it. Played 'I hate children' by adolescents and walked off. Still smile about it
"I tell girls giving me a blowjob that nobody has ever been able to make me cum using their mouth before. The subsequent enthusiasm and determination is fantastic, and when they succeed, the hornyness of a girl that thinks she's now a sex goddess lasts for a long long time."

Chap who lived above my flat would bang his girlfriend hard most nights. She'd screech loudly like in bad porn where the lady is clearly not getting off and putting on a show. So I changed my router name to weallhearyourfakepornscreams. Passive aggressive protests work.
"I banged on a travel agents window somewhat drunk because they didn't show up with my taxi, and subsequently realised that i hadn't changed my clock when crossing from one country to the next and that i was two hours early. It was a very big window. #somewhatdrunk"

I sometimes hope senior royals would hurry up and die just for the day off work.

i once swapped a pair of new shoes from a colleague as I'd ordered the wrong size. I took pleasure in watching him hobble around in these tiny shoes that should have been mine knowing I'd got his new shoes on. We were postmen so having good fitting shoes was imperative. Sorry Lee
People thought I lost weight to be healthy. I actually lost weight so I could suck myself off. It worked.
I'm not gay but I've been meeting men online for sex. I enjoy the rush of meeting a stranger and sucking them off. Been at it for 15 yrs & never told a soul.
"A well know shop sent me two expensive watches ordered one, they sent two. I let them know, they thanked me for my honesty and asked me to drop the extra one into one of their stores. It's been six months, It's currently sitting in my cupboard. Only eve... #orderedonetheysenttwo"

"When myself and my best pal were 12 we had a who can't poo the longest competition. I won, because after 6 days he shit himself in my dad's Volvo on the drive home from my birthday party."
"As a kid, I used to kill frogs with a homemade death machine that was made of two heavy planks of wood with nails sticking through one ending each one and a hinge in between them. Kinda like a stapler but designed only for killing frogs."

There's a taxi driver round the corner from my parents house who always parks his car on the pavement. Each time I walk past I knock his mirror back harder and harder. The eventual aim is to knock it completely off.

"The only reason I bother keeping up with Christmas cards is so I can look up how much friends and family paid for their houses and look at the photos, sometimes I look it up on streetview too."
"When my ex left, it was a couple of months before I left our home. They spent a fuck ton of money on diet powder shakes and I mixed spoonfuls of sugar into the packets and they couldn't work out why they remained lardy."
I hate this whole corona thing because my weed is finished and buying some is hard because a bunch of people are in isolation :
Years ago I jumped on the back of a neighbours car which had a trailer attached. The trailer popped off and rolled down the hill outside our house and crashed into the back of another neighbours car. To this day no one knows what happened.

You know when you sometimes randomly salivate with your mouth open and it comes out like a light spray? I call this the venom spit. I enjoy venom spitting all over the mirror in public toilets and the toilets at work. Sometimes my venom residue is still there days later.

"I'm a 24-year-old London based 'Sugar Baby'. I have four daddies that each pay me £500 a month for two overnight meets. So that's £2k a month for eight shags. They are nice guys, but I think they are crazy to pay so much for such a fleeting experience."

I sleep with mini babybels down my bra so they're all soft and squidgy for breakfast
"I moderate a nerdy guitar Facebook group that almost exclusively attracts men of 65 and above, and always check their other page likes. If it's all 'Hank Marvin brand buttplugs keeping me hard since 1961', fine, but any right wing stuff and they get blocked."
"I am a middle-aged man, but I've recently got into tagging. Spraying a word on things. I think my tag is neat, but I mainly do it to wind people up. Trekking around the city under cover of darkness is exciting, but it really takes it out of me and takes days to recover."

"I can't stop thinking about writing a reboot of 'Allo 'Allo, but instead of Nazi occupied France it would be coalition occupied Iraq during the Hussein regime. Thus it would be called Allah Allah. Reckon the beeb would be up for it."

I interviewed someone about Bond for TV in the noughties in a special Science Museum 007 exhibition. I decided he'd sit on an ice chair prop from a film set - but it collapsed. He was fine but the fibreglass chair wasn't. I kicked the bits under another exhibit and kept schtum.

Neighbours haven't twigged that you can get a quid back for the refillable beer bottles at the local poncy offie. Been making £10-20 a week for about 3 years just by removing them from their recycling when I put mine out. They are stuck up wankers so I feel no shame whatsoever.

When my daughter was 10 months old I needed a cigarette that bad that when she was asleep I nipped out and left her home alone and bought a pack. I was only gone exactly 7 mins. I've regretted it ever since but still smoke

Whenever anyone stops me and asks for directions I send them in a completely wrong direction. I always sign off with a confident you can't miss it at the end too.
"I genuinely regret not knowing more drug dealers, or taking more drugs. I see on Twitter and Facebook people who do LSD or k every week, or can call up weed every night, and it bothers me, because I enjoyed drug taking as a youngster. I feel so old and boring."
Girl I know on Facebook posted a pic and I replied cute selfie but turns out I didnt read the caption and it was actually a pic of a missing girl she was sharing and now I want the earth to swallow me whole

I once posed as a twenty years old woman on twitter. In fact I'm an obese middle aged man but I flirted with saddos and pretended to be in poverty just so I could get dick pics from weirdos and the odd free kebab.
In 1985 I cheated in my Economics A Level by copying all but one answer off the lad next to me in the multiple choice paper. I got 48/50 and got a B in the A Level. My whole life has been built upon this cheat.
My amusing claim to fame i often tell people is that I was the under 10s Scottish Schoolboys Orienteering Champion in 1980. Except I actually came third. Out of 4 entrants.

I sometimes look at songs my ex has been listening to on their Spotify account. I check the lyrics and often wonder if they know I've been looking and are sending me indirect messages. I miss them too.
I am a married woman who works nights with an attractive single woman. I have been carefully setting up situations for her to think the office is haunted for months because it is such a turn on when she thinks I am brave and grabs my hand for comfort.

I have had 2 potentially ruinous confessions posted here in recent months. I've then joined in with the moral outrage brigade in the comments below them with my public account.
"As a kid I had every bike I ever had stolen. I had the absolute longest paper round and when I was having to walk it after my last bike was taken, I pinched some poor kids Grifter. I stashed it in a hedge everyday I had to deliver papers to his house. Felt a twat ever since"
"My Mother in Law is in a vegetative state in the hospital, and all I want to do is pull the plug on her."
"My wife's youngest sister used to work with me. On the Christmas doo, we somehow ended up in the local strip club. Somehow, we had joint lap dance, with us sitting next to each other whilst the dancer did her thing. I often think about this odd - but utterly wonderful - 5 minutes"
"I'm 22 and there is a guy at work in his mid 40s that blatantly fancies me, even though I don't think he's attractive I'm incredibly turned on by the thought of him wanking to me"
Its Valentine day and I'm alone so looking up all my exes on Facebook and seeing which ones have aged badly to make myself feel better
"I cheered when I heard Iris Murdoch had dementia. I felt awful afterwards, but after having to endure The Bell as an A level Eng Lit text I grew to hate that book, and by association, the author."
My cousin and I use to tell eachother what each other's anus looked like as kids. Colour and everything. Just curious kids.
I drop my wife off at work each morning and after waving goodbye to her some days instead of going to work myself I go straight home and binge watch box sets.
I then collect her at the end of the day giving her the impression I've just finished a days hard graft.
"I have a favourite child, I got his name tattooed on me and not his sisters hoping she'll get the hint and fuck off soon"
"I taught my elderly vicar father to use a word processor. He typed in an order of service and I showed him fonts, moving texr, formatting etc. Then I searched for all mentions of CONGREGATION, replacing them with PEASANTS. He pissed himself laughing. I said I'd never tell."
"I often buy two valentines cards, one for my wife and one for my girlfriend. I don't have a girlfriend, I just like the idea that after I leave the shop assistants will gossip about me. Now that I think about it I don't have a wife either. My life is very sad."
Whilst sitting round all saying how we hated our boss and wanted to do the usual pissing in mugs the fun stopped when the creepy new guy described in detail how to remove a radio active isotope from a smoke detector and use it to inflict terminal cancer on said boss.
An A list celeb gave me genital herpes. Being contacted by 'her people' was weird and involved an NDA but at least she told me. Dunno what I was supposed to do though. I'd already unwittingly infected my partner. I blamed it on snogging a teenage girlfriend with a cold sore.
"Late 90's. Found myself in corporate VIP festival area. Get chatting to diminutive antipodean pop princess. Got lucky. Very lucky. Hotel was awesome. Did the right thing, left discreetly in the morning. Do not give a flying dingo if you call liar, I know. She knows. Yes I am smug"
"There's a Twitter user, ordinary person, not a celeb or anything, who is an utter cunt in every way but makes such excellent book recommendations I unblock them whenever I need reading ideas. Still a cunt though."
When I rented a house there was a Hoover under the stairs with a wider than usual hose/nozzle. Yes I stuck my cock in it and it made me ejaculate. It was great and did it a few times but I felt sorry for the next tennant if they went to change the bag

"Two drunk guys came into the bar where i worked and ordered doubles of the fanciest whisky we had at £65 per shot, £260 total. They were too pissed to know the difference, so I gave them bells - worth £12 total - and drank the nice whisky myself. It was fucking gorgeous."
I have been made redundant from a major bank. I have a spreadsheet with every employees salary and bonus on it. Today I emailed to everyone in the company

I'm a Trustee on one of the UK's biggest pension funds. Billions of £ in assets. I haven't got a clue what's going on. In most of the meetings I barely understand half of the words that are said. They pay me a fortune. Not even slightly guilty.
Whilst at school I ran into one of my CDT teachers whilst we were both cruising for gay sex in public toilets. Didnt shag him but I used this knowledge to get him to help make props for the school play when previously he had been unwilling to help.

"I have been driving without insurance for 7 months now! It's so expensive, I'm broke but need my car. I drive very safely and make sure the car is working so the cops won't pull me."
I use the men's toilets instead of the women's at work. There are fewer men so they're a lot cleaner.
I often sneak security tags bought from eBay into my mortal enemy's pocket so now every time they go through the metal detectors in shops they get in trouble for 'stealing' every time they walk in or out
I've just eaten corned beef for the first time in a decade and its made my piss smell like ammonia
"At school I was told that if I kept picking my nose, my nostrils would go enormous. So the last twenty years, I have studiously just picked one nostril, leaving the other as a control. As far as I can tell, no difference"
"At school, aged around 15, a new kid arrived from the US. He was a bit slow, so I helped convince him that we all called one of the school nutters, a slightly overweight lad, Fatman Joe. We didn't, in fact it used to drive him insane with rage. He received quite a beating"
"My flatmate brought a Tinder date back one afternoon. He went to get ready before going out but took an age. She told me to ask him what he was doing. I couldn't quite hear what he said, so when I came back I lied and told her he was washing his feet. She left shortly after that."
"Instead of smearing my bum with toilet paper, I love using the bath sponge soaked in warm water and soap for a thorough clean. It's amazing what comes off. I do my best to clean the sponge afterwards... My wife has no idea."

Every time I have a shave I like to lick the hairs off of the razor at least onceHave to physically restrain myself from doing it every time now
"A while ago I wrote the word 'poo' on the wall of a pub toilet. I felt so ashamed that I went back the next day to try and scrub it out. The pub was closed, so I've been living with my guilt ever since."
"Every time I see a horribly deformed pet that will be on meds and treatments all its life and will never live a natural life because of do-gooder 'animal lovers', it makes me furious. Let the poor thing go, and stop posting pics of it all over social media."
Once I took a female friend to a sauna/swingers club and had sex with her alongside 4 other guys. I think about it constantly and am sad I'll never have an experience that intense again.

Popped out for grocery and pinched someone else's empty supermarket trolley and pocketed the pound. I feel alive!
Colleagues thought I was a gifted 'animal whisperer' when a co-workers husband visited our office with their dog. Dog was incredibly obedient and affectionate towards me. Been having an affair with his wife for months. I'd met the dog 50 times before.
The affair I am just finishing up with a work colleague has been a historically lovely and positive chapter in my life. Unbelievably sweet and hot and intense. Can't recommend an affair highly enough. Five stars.
"At least twice a week, I steal coffee beans from the machine in work, sneaking them out inside my travel mug, to use at home. I see it as my employer paying for my first brew of the day, ensuring I arrive in work already bright and alert."
"I was kind, generous and attentive towards my girlfriend. She broke up with me via a cruel text message saying among other things that I was fat and didn't make enough money.I grassed her up for tax evasion. No regrets."
We ordered about £120 worth of Protein powder online. Yodel decided putting the box in the middle of our drive was a safe place to leave it when we weren't in. We claimed it didn't arrive... got the whole order re-sent.
While working at a bar I mistakenly connected a Helium gas bottle to a beer pump instead of CO2. Interestingly none of the regulars had squeaky voices but for the next week some complained that they'd had the shits.

"I often buy my wife a Valentine's Day card and also buy a fiancé and Girlfriend one as well. I don't have a girlfriend or a fiancé, I do this to make the people at the card shop think I am a cheat."
"A creme egg wouldn't scan at the self checkout because of the way the foil was wrapped, so I just stole it. A week later I picked up 2 creme eggs and put them in a glass bowl I was buying. The checkout lady only scanned the bowl, so I got the eggs for free!"

"I'm right handed but have been steadily getting more ambidextrous every year, impressing friends and family. I tell them it's because I practice stuff with my left hand but really it's because i switched wanking hand 7 years ago. Surprising how it can help."
"The main reasons that I work out, chat to other parents and dress well is to be the flirty hot dad on the school run. If I didn't have that to do I would stop the gym, avoid speaking, wear the same jeans constantly and live in a beanie."

"My dog died on August 2019. Although being very sad at the time, I also felt extremely relieved as she was 16 years old and needed some medical care here and there. Never told anyone how I actually felt about it. She was the best dog we've ever had."

I am a teacher and it's only a matter of time before I tell a 9 year old to fuck the fuck off.

"I have been paying for a gym membership I can't afford for the last year, because to cancel it they insist you go in and fill out a form - they won't post the form out and won't take cancellation any other way. I thought going to the gym would help with my anxiety - it hasn't.."

I like to buy blocks of jelly to eat raw.
"I did an unscheduled drugs-induced alfresco shit in Endcliffe Park, Sheffield, wiped my arse on my boxers and discarded them. Next morning when walking through the same park, I saw a little old lady in a frantic tug-o-war with her Jack Russell. The 'rope' was my shitted pants."

When I'm daydreaming and thinking about sex I often think about shooting a load of cum all over a woman. When this happens I often say the word sperm out loud. I guess I must really like the word.
"I've realised, after 10 years, that my partner is a bit thick and incredibly shallow. I've looked continually for hidden depths & talents but have to accept now there just aren't any. I'm so unhappy but can't leave her, as we're tied in financially. We don't have kids."
I'm trying to get our company to stop using a freelancer with all sorts of business-talk reasons but the truth is it's because he plays his music out loud but quietly through a Bluetooth speaker and it always sounds like you've left music playing on your phone #butquietly
"I was shocked to find out at 47 years old I have Aspergers. Everyone says it must be a relief to finally know why I've always been different, and I nod. Thing is, I didn't know I was different, I was happy and successful, now I'm lost. I wish no one told me I was different."
Every single time a person in a workplace or position of authority says a password out loud or types in into something unguarded I memorise it or take note. Passwords = power.
Bored at home the other day and had sex with the Hoover. Feel guilty as it did a better job than the wife.
I think my husband's BO smells divine. I love it. But after 15 years together it's occurred to me that he must be the office stinker that no one knows how to tell. I won't buy him products that could get rid of his delicious smell.
I piss in sinks at home. Mainly because I enjoy the sound of piss going straight down the plug hole and the vast space provided. Quick rinse with hot water and some dettol spray for a clean up. Done.

"Mother in law was staying over, wife got me to run her a bath after a long journey. Used the dog's flea shampoo instead of bubble bath."
I've just installed a smart plug to my son's playstation hidden under the tv unit. It's the only way I can see getting him off playing fortnite long enough to tidy up his shit tip of a bedroom. Modern problems require modern solutions.
I wanked off my dog when I was a kid. I got in his hut and tugged it off till he jizzed. I panicked that I would get caught because it's weird shaped dick wouldn't retract so I had to keep it in the hut for ages so it didn't run round with a boner. Happy dog though
"Last night's left over curry, eaten at lunch, gave me a second wave of tremendous pleasure this afternoon as my farts jet powered my cycle home from work. I felt like a Mario kart character."

"Me and my sons mother are separated. To be an arsehole, I always gave my son chocolate mini eggs before he went back to her house. Now the doctor has diagnosed him with ADHD. I confessed but she doesn't believe me. He's on Ritalin now."
"Llifeguard at the local pool thought I was being helpful scooping a leaf out of the pool and putting it on the side. However, it was a massive turd so the pool was evacuated. Not as bad as it sounds as it was my massive turd I'd accidentally curled out."

"Had to cut off friendship with an alcoholic mate after years of trying to help him. His behaviour became hateful, violent and destructive. Just matter of time before he carks it, and part of me won't be sorry. I'll get pissed at his funeral."
"When my father's drunk on his ass, I sometimes wish he would die of alcohol poisoning so I can marry my boyfriend without guilt. We've been dating long distance for almost 4 years."
I'm a 53 year-old surgeon but I still feel incredibly proud of myself if I do a shit and part of it remains above the water line when I've finished. It can be either a massive log or a pile of softer material - my puerile delight remains the same.
"I used to work in a microfilming department at a large bank. Couldn't be bothered filming the thousands of documents one by one so just chucked piles of them in the bin, voiding thousands of credit agreements."
"I got drunk at a house party and passed out in a bedroom. I pukes in between the two pillows, not knowing what to do I covered it up with a dressing gown and went back to the party. Later we heard a scream. A couple had gone up to use the empty bedroom. The girl was covered"
"When we said OMG – the last one we meant read the final one in the list, it’ll make you go gosh. Not that we’re closing down. FFS. Language is hard."

"I shame people to donate, yet never put a penny in myself."
I dislike my job so much that I lie about meetings in my diary to get out the office. I go for a walk for an hour and then come back. My colleagues have never questioned it.
"I sometimes stare at the sun when it's part behind a cloud or at sunset, I know it's wrong and it takes a while to see properly again"
When in school I made up a story about stepping in dog shit. I blamed the caretaker as he walked his dog in the grounds. This resulted in the care taker being fired for letting the dog shit in school grounds. In fact I had shat myself and it had run down my leg into my shoes.
I'm 27 and have never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl. I think my family thinks I'm gay but it's just my crippling social anxiety. I'm very lonely and nobody knows.
"Whenever i see a missing persons alert for a child in Twitter, i think one of four things Heroin, Crack, kidnapped or dead."
"I used to occasionally drop in for a roll and bacon at a shop on the way to work. One morning, as I left, the woman behind the counter called See you next Thursday."
I now only go on a Tuesday or Thursday in the hope she repeats the comedy moment.
I never really understood empathy so I read some books on it and have been simulating it successfully for the last 20 years based on that. People tell me I'm an awesome listener and such an empathic human being.
I frequently click on online adverts I think are shit just to waste the company's ad revenue
Weekly shopping: I play a game to avoid getting bored. She gets the sensible stuff but I grab mangoes and see how many I can sneak into strangers' trolleys. Bonus points if someone accidentally pays for one.
"Noticed a really hot girl across a crowded room and dropped my eyes to check if she was wearing a wedding ring. But at exactly that moment she glanced up and caught my eye. Thing was, her hand was badly deformed. She covered it and gave me a withering look. I felt a total shit"
I was down near the front at a Pogues concert in Glasgow. Had had a few beers and was bursting for a slash. Couldn't be bothered fighting my way out and back in so I just pissed myself and carried on having a good night. I think Shane would approve.

My wife thinks I take ages to shower and get dressed in the morning. In fact I'm really quick at both but while she's downstairs getting the kids dressed I jump back into bed for 5-10 more minutes' napping before I do anything
"On student campus I'd get wasted & knock the doors of random student flats & say I'm Dave's mate. Once in, I'd help myself to food. Once I was so hammered I left some frozen food in the microwave. Later that night the 6 storey building was evacuated & surrounded by fire engines."
I'm still listening to and enjoying Christmas CDs alone in the car. I'm a 50 y/o man. Just heard Little Donkey. Marvellous.
I work as an independent software contractor and for the last two years have worked for three companies at the same time. None of them know about the other two and all three think I am working full time for them.
"I once took a shit so potent, that it set off the fire alarm. My proudest achievement in 34 years and no one can tell me otherwise"
I used to have a job where I'd travel around Australia. Every crappy motel had a bible from the Gideons in it. I'd jerk off onto Genesis pages about Onan. Seemed the best place to do it.
"At a merchant bank in London I trained users to use pre-internet email. I was shit at it. I also did the tech support. I often got calls about the crap training. I asked for the trainer's details and said we take complaints very seriously, action will be taken. N... #preinternet"
I used to work at a museum. When we worked behind the information desk me and a colleague used to compete to see who could give the most confusing directions to foreign tourists.

"Staffed the PCW Show stand for a big UK home computer company in the 80s. Me+pal made tapes/disks of Pigman, a 2 frame animation of a farmer fucking a pig. Ran these on as many competitor stands as poss, watching to see how long b4 stand staff noticed. Acorn won with 30 mins."
"I'm trans. I've known this for years, and due to my circumstances, I can't come out publicly. It's eating me up inside, so I had to share somewhere. Thanks for listening."
I like to switch the cardboard sleeves on ready meals in M&S to spice up an unsuspecting tikka masala eater's evening.
"I have a crush on my lovely dentist. Each appointment is a joy, I enjoy lying with my head cradled between her breasts as she pokes around in my mouth."

"My boss crashed his car whilst drunk and being sucked off by his then secretary. He called 3 of us to move his car for him and had a surgeon sew up his wound for his missing finger. His wife never found out, nor did the authorities and have kept the secret for the last 30 years"
I sometimes play the 'Kevin Says' game. Using a burner phone I txt random numbers. My favourite is 'Kevin says an extra 2 inches are in order' Hours of entertainment.

"I had a kind, but soft English teacher and no one ever read the books he set. He also managed the library at lunch. I once picked outThe Canterbury Tales and left it on a table to cheer him up that at least someone, somewhere in the school cared about reading. Made him smile."
"I once dressed as Hitler to a costume party. Tiny moustache, swastika, salute - the lot. I'm mortified. Not only is it offensive, but the pictures could do real damage to my career and my reputation. I'm terrified they'll resurface one day."
"I live in a small town in the Scottish Borders. Not much happens so I keep myself entertained by running 12+ twitter accounts, often arguing with myself for weeks and months."
I swipe right to every woman on tinder and bumble. I regularly meet fat ugly women telling myself it is a 'practice date' for when a hot one comes along. I have sex with them all and then never call them again.
"When I worked at McDonald's around 20 years ago, I used to pick my nose with the coffee stirrers and put them back in the box ready to be given to customers"
Last week in a supermarket I leant into a big box full of potatoes in bags while my nose was running. It dripped everywhere. I hope people wash their spuds before eating them. Sorry.

I consciously use a different cubicle each time I use the toilet at work. It gives my bleak life some variety.

I gave a random guy a blow job in the gym changing room whilst my wife was finishing her spinning class
"Someone bought our son a Union Jack mug. When we have company, I hide it away in case people think we are racists."

There are very few of my mates' wives that I wouldn't shag. Even the ones I'm not that keen on.
"I became a sort of amateur prostitute at university. It started by just asking to borrow the taxi fare home in the morning from boys I'd pulled, to asking for it before sex, and then just asking for £30 for sex it was the early 90... #itwastheearly90sandthatseemedlikeafairprice"

"I lost my Sony Ericsson Walkman in secondary school during a PE trip, I went home and told my mum I was robbed and then had to drive around the park in a CID car looking for the imaginary thieves."
Whenever I have sex with my wife I put the lights off and I wear a strapon. The reason is because my penis is really small.
I'm straight but drunkenly slept with a man. I spent all the next day crying and eating McDonalds.
I'm in my thirties but I still have an irrational fear of leaving my feet outside of the bed covers incase monsters or robbers grab them.
"I'm addicted to the website Adultwork and I'm about halfway through my list of sex workers I'd like to bang. It's a very expensive hobby, but I'm putting money into the cash economy."
I grew up in Shetland and I once accidentally chased a sheep over a cliff while trying to terrorise my little sister. The crofter worked out that I was the guilty party and made me do errands for him for years in exchange for him not telling my mum.
My wife thinks I go to the gym. Truth is I have one of those muscle toners. I use it at work for 20 mins and it is making just enough difference. When she thinks I'm at the gym I'm sat in Tesco car park playing poker.
"When cutting up turkey dinosaurs for my son, I always cut the heads off first so they don't suffer."
I pretended to be vegetarian to help get this girl into bed. We've been married 8 years now and the lie persists. Sometimes I drive 30 miles to a drive through MacDonald's so I can be sure not to get found out.
"I found out one of my work colleagues was pretending to be a war veteran online. I outed him to one of the Walter Mitty fb groups and he ended up getting sacked after the local paper got wind of it. No regrets, he was a prick #hewasaprick"
"I've been working on youth projects for the past 5 years. I have to display an aura of positivity and leadership to them, but the truth is the work has demoralised me, made me grow to utterly despise young people and fear for the future of our species."
I got fired by an absolute arsehole last year... so I informed the Ethiopian government of some of the company's shadier dealings there. They had to cancel the build of a new factory there in the end.
"I won a home cinema system in a competition. It hadn't turned up after a month so I emailed them. They sent another one, then the original one turned up. I had no need for either so sold them both on eBay."
"I don't work and my husband praises me on how beautifully I keep the house, I have a cleaner who he has no idea about, she irons his shirts too."

"A mate, a serious cyclist, bought an expensive new magnesium bike frame. He was very disappointed that his times weren't better."
Every time he parked it at the rugby club we'd take the saddle off & put fishing weights in the frame
I hate everyone I went to school with. I'm in my 50s now and follow them on Facebook just so I get to hear when one of the dies. I generally celebrate with a small scotch but I never gloat.

I recently started weighing myself pre and post shit. In order to set new PRs I now hang on as long as possible between dumps. 1.9 kg is my current record. 2.0 in sight but it's going to hurt.
"Age 10 playing with my action man and tried to burn him with a magnifying glass. I missed and set some grass cuttings on fire. Burned down garden hut, 3 trees and side of the house. Took 5 fire engines to control. Blamed the kid next door. Never told M&D. now dead.Soz."
"Six years ago, a drunk driver crashed into my house and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage. He lives locally, and ever since I regularly post envelopes full of my cat's poop through his letterbox."
"There is an old lady next door who is very private, doesn't like visits but doesn't have any family. I often cup my ear to the walls to check up on her. As soon as I hear her cough or make any noise I happily go about my business knowing she is alive."
"Since my wife declined to have sex anymore, over 6 years ago, whenever we watch sex scenes on TV you can cut the tension with a knife. I feel like a teen watching 007 getting it on with a Bond girl in front of my parents again."
A friend of my parents' walked in on me attempting autofellatio. It was over 20 years ago and I still wince daily at the memory.
"came Back from a night out, I needed a mega piss so Aldi car park came into play. However as I was releasing gods seasoning, I saw a pile of leaves on the floor. So I resumed. It was a homeless man and I shit you not he grumbled have you got some change sir. Bolted."

When I was 9 in Majorca I mistakenly threw this huge flat stone and hit a girl right on the head who collapsed on the sea & was dragged out by her two male friends. I never told anyone. To this day I'm not sure if I killed her.
Found an old engraving kit whilst having a clear out. Keeping it with the intention of defacing any Brexit 50ps that I get.

"My girlfriend found out I logged our last shag into my FitBit as 20mins sexual activity- vigorous,active and now she hardly touches me and makes me take it off when she does"
When I can't climax I think about my school friend's mum in 1981 mincing round in her blue carpet slippers and it literally floods out. Infact I need to crack off now.
"I'm really disgusted by the concept of toilet brushes, I've never used one in my life. I'd sooner pour 15 litres of bleach down to blast the worst of it off than use a brush to do it."
I have really bad adhd and sometimes I consider just becoming a heroin addict so that the drug problem will draw my family's attention away from how much of a mess I already am

When my mother in law pisses me off I put dead batteries in the TV remote just before I go away for a few days. It gives me petty satisfaction to know that she will be jabbing the buttons and swearing at the remote. I helpfully install new batteries on my return.
"My upstairs neighbour annoyed me so much I put a desiccated dead rat on her stairs, which she stepped on, barefoot. She screamed the place down. I can no longer remember what she did to annoy me."
"When my wife gets a new catalogue I head straight for the lingerie section like a 13 year old, I'm 47"
My first two boyfriends had very large penises and I had no idea at the time because I had nothing to compare them to and now I'm disappointed every single time but have to hide my disappointment. Also I feel I really wasted those large penises.
It's Sunday morning and I'm giving my house a good top to bottom clean. Feeling fresh. Just found a gram of coke down the back of my couch. Which ive now decided to sniff because.... why not
"If I get really, really annoyed at work I'll go to the toilet and have a wee but use the full flush button because - that'll teach them! Then I realise 'they' won't know or care; and then I feel guilty about wasting water....."
I used to run a money club in work. Over 10 weeks 10 people gave £10 and at one point everyone got £100. I was allways the first person and used the interest free money to pay my car insurance.
I'm a Labour member atm but I think I might be a Tory? Absolutely terrified to make the switch while at uni.
Sometimes I regret having my son. The no sleep is a killer and I look haggered and pale 24/7. I often fantasise about driving away in the middle of the night and finding somewhere quiet to sleep where I can't be disturbed.
My wife and I got married in a beautiful romantic setting in a tiny chapel in a wood. As we left I turned and gazed into her eyes then said your my wife now in the style of papa lazarou. I'm not terribly mature. I was 36
After 19 years I actually can't stand my husband. He thinks I'm still head over heels in love. Sex is the only thing I look forward to. He is amazing in bed. This is all we have left!

I get turned on by my own tits. They're really great

Whenever I get new work gloves I always ask for a larger pair than I need so they won't think I have a small penis.
The Guy who bullied me at school was blown up in Afghanistan. He lost a foot and lives with his mum suffering from crippling PTSD. He made my life hell as a kid and I wish I could donate to the Taliban to thank them for giving me such joy.
"Its frowned upon to have a favourite child but the same can't be said of pets. I adore my dog, I love her like a 3rd child. The cat however is just a scratchy arsehole."
I've been self-employed for 10 yrs and not paid a penny in tax. I was anxious about the process when I first started up so I just didn't bother and assumed HMRC would write to me and there would be clear instructions and deadlines etc. They never did.
I have a very serious job in the private sector. I recently discovered I can stream music through my phone headset without my colleagues knowing. Yesterday I listened to Boney M's greatest hits while pretending to be on a conference call to a supplier

"I got made redundant and starting selling coke as a way to make ends meet. I've since got a full time, well paid job, but I haven't stopped selling. It's too easy to make alot of money."

I have had three miscarriages in a row and I hate every single person on the planet who has a baby or is pregnant.
"When I'm in lecture, I wear big jumpers so I can take my boob out my bra and play with my nipples under my jumper. I don't know why it's just fun"
"I earn a decent wage, enough to buy my own meat at the supermarket. I don't though. Every time I go I steal my meat by weighing fresh fruit or veg I have in my basket along with the meat, then bag it. I've been doing this for over 10 years now"
I rage irrationally when someone says I'm happy after eating or drinking something nice. I decided against hiring someone solely because she said it when our coffee arrived at the start of the interview.

I have been micro dosing magic mushrooms for 6 weeks. I feel genuinely great and I have stopped caring about all the nonsense in my life. Downside? Can't be bothered to wank anymore. Confusing.
My three year old has a six-lane Hot Wheels race ramp. Several times when I've been home alone I've done full-on tourneys of all his toy cars to find a champion.
"Went to silence girlfriends phone after it woke me & saw dick pic message on screen. I clicked to find she'd sent a underwear pic & he wanted more. I pushed my shoulders together to make a bust & sent it. After his reply to say he 'enjoyed it', I dumped her without mentioning it."
"Moving out of my ex's house after being dumped, I took one sock from each of a few pairs I knew he particularly liked. I put them in the neighbour's bin and feigned ignorance when he contacted me weeks later to ask if I had accidentally taken some of his socks with me."
"In the early days of online flight booking, I accidentally clicked, hearing impaired. I couldn't understand why I was receiving so much attention until I noticed my boarding pass said, DEAF. I was too embarrassed to correct it, and spent the rest of the flight pretending."
"I can't tell the difference between Russian troll accounts and say, some prick of a bricklayer who thinks making 70k a year and cooking the books a bit makes him Crawley's answer to Jeff Bezos."

I voted Labour in the last election but am secretly glad the Tories won

I watch PornHub daily. Especially the taxi stuff....if I get in a black cab and the driver doesn't tell me I've fantastic knockers I'll be really disappointed.

I was thinking of things to put on Fesshole... I thought what about saying 'I've wanked in every room of the house'? I haven't actually done it. But now I've thought of it I really want to and I am going to do it.
Most weeks the recycling wheelie bin is full to the brim a couple of days before it's collected. I chuck any excess recycling straight in the normal bin.
"As a kid, I came home to a distraught mother and a couple of police officers. There were splits in the downstairs windows where someone had tried to force the window open from the outside. Mum couldn't sleep and dad had home security installed. I had locked myself out. It was me."
I have told many people that I used to see Mark E Smith from The Fall down the pub in Prestwich all the time.
I never saw him once. In fact I hardly ever go there and don't like The Fall that much anyway.
Am 45yr old father of boys. Never seen Frozen. Every time 'Let it Go' comes on in the car I hold back the tears. I can't even jovially sing along as emotion makes my throat constrict. If I sing I will bawl. That singer Means. Every. Single. Word. Fuck man - it's amazing.

"I live above a Cats Protection charity shop and we share a doorway. I fuckin' hate cats. People often leave bags of donated tat in the doorway after the shop's closed. A couple of times, I've taken the bags down the road to the Dogs Trust shop - but usually it goes in my bin."

When I was 5 I ate a whole box of After Eights from my mum's sideboard where she kept the good china. It was for guests. I couldn't stop once I'd started. I tried to cover my tracks by putting the packaging in the fire but it didn't burn through so I told mum it was my dad.

"Years ago, I met TV presenter Johnny Vaughan in a bar in Manchester. We had a nice chat and, as I turned to go, he put his hand out to shake mine. However, he timed it about a quarter of a second too late, and I walked off. I often think about that, with surprisingly deep shame."

The only paper in my work is Talk to Frank leaflets and I've used them all as tubes to snort cocaine

A lad I was speaking to once commented that his much fitter brother would never be interested in me so I proceeded to seduce his brother to prove a point then I discovered a third brother and did the same. No one knows. But I do.

When making the bed I only use every other button. My wife has no idea. Every year I estimate I save 13 minutes. Which I use to treat myself to a wank.

I've stopped going to gay saunas and have started putting the money I would have spent into savings for a motorbike. Effectively swapping one mid-life crisis for another. My wife is unaware of either.
I sometimes wish I was an alcoholic so I could then go into recovery and then brag to my friends that I'm x days clean and get little badges as I go through the stages.
It cost 10p to use the phone in the reception at my secondary school. I used to go in and call phone sex lines whilst laughing to myself while the stern office staff looked on.

"I work in accounts and often I leave on a monitor a trading screen with moving price graphs, with buy and sell, orders etc. I don't understand it and definitely don't need it. I want it to make me look important. Or competent."
"When I was a kid, I was worried about leaving skidmarks in my pants, so I used to ball up some bog roll and put it between my bum cheeks after wiping. I'm 30 now and still regularly do this. Once it fell out, down my trouser leg and onto the street, I don't think anyone saw."
When I worked in a supermarket I would purposefully throw the fancy Easter eggs down the stairs. We couldn't display them so were allowed to take them to the staff to finish them off.

"Years ago, I was seeing a woman and stayed at her house one night, after us both drinking heavily. I awoke to her frantically shouting my name. I looked down and I was pissing into a tealight candle shell near the door. I must have been sleepwalking. I carried on pissing."
"Due to both laziness, a single bathroom on an upper level of the house and an overwhelming guilt about pissing in the sink, I have started to piss in the dishwasher, part of me hopes my missus would understand why."
"He's everything I've ever wanted. Funny, smart and confident. He's married and his wife is lovely yet all I think about is him"

I use a coin flipping app on my phone to make most of the large decisions in my life. Including if I should impregnate my girlfriend or not. I did.
"Anytime a customer is arsey to me in the store, interrupting or whatever, I take immense pleasure in giving them the worst change possible. Ex: Posh cunt with £20 notes uses them for a 50p purchase. Its fucking hilarious seeing their face drop when i give em a fiver and 20 50..."
"I have an ageing family friend who I suspect might leave me something in her will, but I find her really annoying. She's currently travelling the world and that bothers me because if she dies abroad the cost of repatriating her body is likely to reduce my potential windfall."

"My wife and kids want a dog, but I'm dead set against it as just don't like them and they're expensive and needy and I'll probably be the one having to look after it, so I said if they get a dog then I'm going to move out, and I've a feeling they're going to call my bluff..."
I've had to mute the family WhatsApp group because my brothers naughty elf posts are that annoying I nearly deleted the app last year. It does my head in
"Last year my partner, sister in law and dad visited a really nice, chain, Indian restaurant. We each had a couple of dishes and alcoholic drinks. When the bill arrived it was for £20, likely a quarter of the real bill. I paid it and we swiftly left."

Never done it since although I do look at Henry longingly with a wicked smile sometimes.
After getting a bollocking at primary school I stuffed the tv/video combi player full of blu-tac. The next time it was wheeled into our class the teacher destroyed a Science for Schools cassette and the whole thing had to be binned and replaced at great expense.

"Where I grew up there was this dude hitting on my then girlfriend. Someone vandalized his car by putting sugar in the petrol tank, he blamed me and my mate, we honestly didn't do it, but seeing as the guy wasn't well liked, we took the glory anyway!"
"I don't think my mum will ever be proud of what I do. I earn £4k a month with voiceover work, but I still think she'd only be happy if I was unhappy and doing a minimum wage 9-5 office job."
I once opened a gas bill that wasn't addressed to me and was so convinced I'd be arrested for it that I tore it into thousands of tiny bits and mixed it with layers of wax until it was hidden inside a candle

"Sometimes I get so angry about nothing in particular, when I'm driving I hope that people cut me up or do something equally as irritating just so I can explode in a ball of fiery, sweary rage. I haven't deliberately encouraged it. Yet."

"I sent my DNA to an ancestry website because I suspect my relative is a serial killer, but I'm too much of a chicken shit to call the cops. Hopefully they will catch him now."
I joined the Labour Party to vote for Corbyn in 2015. I now tell everyone I voted for Andy Burnham
"As a kid, I found a bee buzzing in the corner of an outside window. I grabbed it by its head, called my little brother over; poked him in the arm with the stinger. He finked to our parents. I said, How could I do that? I'd be the one stung?; he was in deep sht!"
I've worked as a sysadmin for 10 years. My only real duty is turning on the printer because nobody else knows how to. I make 6 figures for sitting at my desk reading ebooks.

When I was 14 I sold out of date raffle tickets to elderly people in the neighborhood and spent the money on alcopops and cigarettes

"My vegan neighbours have a dog, which they've also decided is vegan. Well, he's not when I walk him. Must've fed him half a cow by now. I'm worried the dog will give the game away though. That guy is not subtle."
Pissed in Squarepusher's champagne bucket at Ministry of Sound some time in the late 90s
I run the company business twitter account and block Tories without hesitation
At school and uni I was always clever enough to do well in tests and exams without really trying or studying. Essays winged at the last minute. I know it sounds conceited but it's really been a curse as I never learnt the discipline to apply myself to anything.
I'm obsessed with 90s drama This Life. I drink wine watching it and imagine I'm living it and they're my friends. I've been doing this for 20 years. I have no friends.

I sometimes accidentally say 'thank you' to electric doors when they open for me.
I cheated on my GCSE's by writing notes on my upper thigh. I asked to go to the loo during most exams and checked key information.

"@tallsam It takes a lot of time to read the submissions and select the ones to post. (There's nearly 10,000 now)"

I have been known to drink the hotdog brine straight out of the can.

"He does nothing to help my disabled mother, hasn't for years but is still treated like the golden child when he shows the least interest."

"I love winter when it gets dark super early. I love leaving work when it's cold and dark, and I just adore getting home when it's cold and dark. I've considered moving to Canada or Scandinavia or somewhere, so it can be cold and dark more of the time."
"I lost my job, so wife got me karate lessons. I didn't go,as i was having an affair and that gave me cover to carry on seeing her.had to pretend to know moves, but 1 night wife got into a row and shouted ,my husband does karate . Bloke she rowed with beat the shit outta me!"

I found a maggot infested body in a ditch in Somerset about 10 years ago and took a selfie with it before I called the police. I was getting night terrors every night until I deleted it from my phone.
"I used to work at a car wash early 90s. I was to give out tokens for every top wash. When someone collected 10 tokens they got a free top wash. I didnt give out the tokens , instead I saved them myself and pocketed the 4.50. I then spent that money on ecstasy at raves."
I regularly put bottles of Prosecco through the self service checkouts at Sainsbury's as bananas. As long as there are some actual bananas in the bag the staff don't seem to care

In a twist on 'knock door ginger' as kids we'd knock ask if Scott Herpes was in. When asked 'Who's Scott Herpes?' We'd yell 'Not me!' and leg it.
I give so few fucks about my work now I couldn't be less effective if I tried. Somehow people still think I'm a top performer when I have a half hour burst of productivity and do something I could have done weeks ago.
"Sometimes I drink at home alone just to get out of driving to the station to pick up my wife. I love my wife, but I'm really lazy. And there's a bus."
I once had a wank in bed with a laptop on my stomach. The trans porn got me so worked up I massively jizzed all over the laptop lid; the gobbets of spunk dribbled down into the power socket and USB ports shorting the motherboard so the laptop never worked again. What a way to go.
"Npower erroneously cancelled our contract after the downstairs flat changed supplier. I phoned NPower, they said nothing they can do about it. Free gas for nearly 3 years, heating on all the time. Saved me over £1000"
"In Year 10 English we had to do an essay on a superstition and its origin - all the easy ones were taken, so I made one up called 'Don't hang glide on a Friday' and created an Urban Dictionary definition to back it up. She took my word that UD was like Wikipedia."
"I got into the habit of eating my cum after wanking just because it's a practical way to clean up. It's not a fetish, I find the taste unremarkable. After coming over a lady I have to fight the instinct to wipe it off them with my fingers and lick them. They think it's weird."
I go on IMDB every single day to look at the birthdays and choose which one movie star I'd sleep with from that day. I'm 38.
"Saw my cat on the side of the road, obviously upset, stopped the car he was dead so put him in my boot. Went home and up the drive walks my cat! Great, someone else's dead cat in my boot. Can't put a dead cat back on the road so buried him and never told..."
Every so often I'll go to my local supermarket and grab all the Sun and Daily Mail papers and hide them somewhere out of reach in the shop

"Gave my ex the old 'it's not you it's me' speech... It was me, I fucked his sisters Fiancé, couldn't fess up to that. Still going to the wedding though. #freebar"
I'm so close to quitting my job. I play out scenarios in my head of launching my laptop across the room and flipping over tables shouting 'fuck offfff' and then walking out. I cried all the way to work this morning. I'm a nurse. I'd get struck off if I did that!
I use a hand signal to cars out at junctions to let them out ahead of me just so I can do a Jedi mind-trick air-swipe and say you can pass
Sometimes when I'm looking in the mirror my face changes to something weird and it's like I'm looking at my evil twin and I find it scary. Help?

I hired a brand new car last week which was exactly the same as my 4yr old model. I spent all weekend stripping every possible part from it and swapping onto mine. My car breezed through its MOT
My wife was away & I had a beer and listened to music. Reminded of how upset I've been about a friend's suicide. Had a cry. Sobbed on & off & screamed for 1/2 hour thinking I was getting release at last. Woke with a gruff throat and feeling no better. Told wife I have a cold.
I blocked the work bog once with a massive shit and had to unblock it with the office watering can. My poo blocked the spout and I had to watch our confused receptionist unblock it with her pen and then start retching at the stench the next day.
My young daughter loves meat but won't eat lamb because they're cute. We've been telling her that the half lamb we bought from the butchers is beef.
Anytime I buy something nice in the shop Ill eat it in my car outside the house so I dont have to share it with my wife and kids

When I was 17 I worked in a large supermarket. I used to regularly swap over the cardboard sleeves on the microwave ready meals. They had the barcodes on so someone skint would get a posh lasagna for 80p and someone else would pay £6 for a pile of shite.
When I was at school I picked up a stone and threw it up in the air as high as I could. It plummeted to Earth and hit a small girl smack on the top of her head. She was off for a week with concussion. I don't think anyone ever worked out what happened.
"My friends think I'm flaky but really I'm avoiding meeting up with anyone because I've put on about four stone in the last year. I'm ashamed and I don't want them to see me like this, but can't seem to get my arse in gear to do something about it."
At work we have an unencrypted database of customer credit card info. I've bought family holidays and Christmas presents on this for years with no repercussions whatsoever.
I still live in the same house with my ex 20 years after we split up. She thinks I don't know she tampers with my food... the things I do to her toothbrush and hairbrush aren't worth mentioning.
I have recently found out my very much loved partner wishes to change gender. I am now desperately trying for him to get me pregnant before he goes down the change route. I have never wanted children previously.
When our kids were small the only way my wife and I could have sex was by distracting them with Peppa Pig videos. To this day when I hear the theme tune I get very aroused
"In art class in high school, this girl was making fun of me, calling me all the names under the sun. I was sat opposite her, our school bags were on some shelves behind her, I could see one was going to fall on her head. I didn't say anything. It fell on her head."
"I was once so hungry I ate a piece of chicken left on the sideboard. Turned out it was raw, I contracted salmonella and shat my guts out for 10 days."
I regularly jizz directly onto the carpet went wanking. Have done so for years and you can tell where the most popular places are by the state of the carpet there.

I sometimes pretend to sign relatives birthday cards from my 3 year old by simply scribbling in the card in a child like manner with my left hand. They think it's adorable she's signed them herself.
I clean my arse with my hand in the sink when we run out of toilet roll. Always the left hand tho
Me and my pal once found a load of porn mags just laying in the street. I was only about 7 so I took one page home and hid it under my bed. Returned home from school one day to find it scrunched up in the fireplace. It was never spoken of.

"Sometimes I say my kid is sick just to get a day off. The get up, eat, work, eat again, take care of my kid, clean, etc. routine is killing me."
I once hacked into my boss's personal email account only to find he had been having a 16 year affair with the general manager. I then printed off the evidence and posted it to his Wife. To this day he has no idea it was me.
"My ex wife was violent towards me and eventually bottled me. I watched her the next morning get into her car and I called the police from my works mobile and she was still over the limit when they pulled her over, totally fucked her career, and I hate myself for it."
After my wife and daughters complained about me leaving the toilet seat up now I always piss in the sink. They've congratulated me more than once for now pissing and putting the seat down after
"A bluebottle once flew into my throat, so I ate it."
"I hate it when ignorant bastard drivers park on grass verges. When I'm walking my dog I take great delight in leaving massive bags of dogshit on their car bonnet, sometimes with the bag ripped."
Every year I do the vegan roast potatoes in goose fat. They're nicer.
"I'm a 30 year old man, have had around ten sexual partners and have never orgasmed with any of them or during a sex act other than masturbation by myself. It is frustrating and embarrassing."
"medics are sometimes expected to do CPR for upto 30mins on hours long dead, nobody talks about how traumatic CPR is for both crew and patient, even if a pulse returns and the patient gets to hospital, the survival rate is abysmal. Anyway sleep well"
It seemed hilarious when we were drunk at the party to piss on my flatmate's calendar of cute puppies' faces. It was less funny when she thought it had just got some beer spilt on it and continued to hang it up in the kitchen for the rest of the year.
"Years ago, my estranged boyfriend took a friend of mine to a hotel. I didn't care about him but I contacted the girls work and told them she'd been boasting about stealing from them. She lost her job."

My boyfriend is getting married. Do I send his wife to be the screenshots and videos by email or through the post?
"I always empty the kettle in work. Even if it is more or less full after making a cuppa, the rest goes down the sink. Fuck 'em, they can fill the bastard themselves."
"When I was around 13, together with a couple of friends we bought some raffle tickets and went door to door selling them for fictional prizes and a made up cause, Better than a crappy Saturday job"
"My ex sis-in-law fancied a home birth so got a paddling pool from Argos. Used it, cleaned it, took it back."

Lady at work always labels her coke/tango/lemonade cans in the fridge. I remove the labels every time I go in there and move the can to the other side of the shelf.
I knew my bosses email login. My boss was also a monumental cunt. I made some absolutely filthy suggestions and sent dick pics from his account to his PA. He 'left to pursue other avenues' shortly after

My neighbour hated my cats. He turned the hose on them if they went in his garden. Then one got shot with an air rifle. He smirked he 'knew nothing' When he went on holiday I fed his fucking hose through his letterbox and turned it on. His wife later told me they weren't insured
"The reason I don't want kids is because I can't - literally - stand the sound of babies crying. If I hear one, I turn my earphones up to a sometimes painful volume to drown it out, if on TV I change channel. I otherwise think I might be an ok mother but I guess we'll never know"
"I once had a big poo off the top of the multi story carpark in town, overlooking an old supermarket, it splattered about a metre circle"

A work colleague always talks about a deceased mutual friend as if they were best buddies. I once shared an office with the late lamented and he never stopped slagging him off. If I told him he'd be devastated.

"I once walked 5 miles home after a night out. Halfway down, I needed a shit but no toilets were about. I found a skip and perched on the corner and dropped a monster log. Thankfully, & I shit you not, there was an unopened pack of kitchen roll in there for me to use. No regrets."
In the 1980s our local computer store let you try games before you buy. I had a walkman with a record facility in the inside pocket and a mic cable running down the sleeve. As the game loaded from the visible tape deck it was pirated to the hidden deck. Did this for years.

"As a teen I used to wank in the bath. But the cum would go floating around in the bath water and get stuck to me as I got out. So to avoid that I used to eat it Once I brought 2 slices of bread with me and came into that intending to eat it as a sandwich, but I was too disgusted."
"I used to take my Labrador everywhere with me, shops, supermarkets etc, hated leaving him, so when challenged by members of staff that there were no dogs allowed, I'd tell them he was my blind dads guide dog and it was the dogs day off."
"It never failed, plus, my dad wasn't blind."

Every time i get in a work van i delete the same person's paired phone from the stereo. Drives him mental

"I used to hate my job. Every day, I'd go into the kitchen and pour two pints of milk down the joint between the wall and kitchen units. Within weeks, the stench of stale milk was so bad they had to rip the units out and refit the kitchen. I then set to work on the new units..."

I work in the public sector dealing with things people pay for. If you're a Tory or act like a cunt I'll make sure you pay the maximum amount possible. If you're nice I'll go out my way to make the services free.

When I started wanking I used to do it into my sock & then throw them in the wash basket. After a month or so my mum casually asked me at the dinner table to stop 'blowing my nose' into my socks. The way she said blowing your nose made it clear she knew it was not snot #notsnot
I quite like the new Coldplay song.
I always take as many complimentary sachets of condiments as possible from the food to go section when shopping in Morrisons. Current record: 11 in a single visit.

"I won £350k, I haven't told my wife and just make our lives much more comfortable on the sly."
"I used to work in IT support, and would break people's computers to have an excuse to talk to them. I knew people's deadlines, so just delete a DLL or break a printer and I could swoop in and save the day. Such a hero I actually got laid as a result of this more than once."
One night I was off my tits and went to a mates flat. He wasn't in so I booted the door in with the intention of waiting inside. Sat in his front room for ten minutes before realising I'd gotten the wrong house and legged it. The girl whose flat it was moved a week later.

When I worked in procurement for a well known frozen pizza brand I took huge bribes for letting a supplier massively understate the potato starch content of pre-grate mozzarella. Paid off half my mortgage.

My ex used to accuse me of loving the cat more than her. I denied it but it's true. I love that cat more than I love any human being.
"I resent my wife for talking me into having a child, we used to travel and dine out all the time but now I'm responsible for a screaming, scratching, vomitting, pissing, shitting humanoid with no survival instincts...and she's talking about having another one. Great."
I was jealous of a kid at school with a Sega game gear. So I stole it and gave it to a kid from another school on the way home

I once voted Tory. I thought I was the middle England they were defending so what little money I earn wasn't taken away for benefits to the lazy. I read the Daily Mail and believed their propaganda. I'm sorry.

"I once wrote a glowing false reference for a hideously incompetent guy who I had sacked, to avoid getting sued. He ended up getting a senior role at one of our rivals, who then went bust. I've never felt more powerful."

My wife and I have clear euphemisms when addressing our young children. We tell them they're 'twits' and 'characters' but we know we mean they're twats and cunts. The flipping twits and characters.
It's really clear that the youngest of my brother's three kids isn't his - he looks nothing like his dad while the other two do. It's bugging me so much I worry one day I'm just going to blurt it out.

Whenever my twitter mutuals piss me off I go through years worth of their tweets via advanced search specifically reporting tweets I know is gonna their get their accounts temporarily suspended. I feel no guilt over it
"When I'm at gigs and I see people filming I sing/shout along as loudly as possible, but deliberately get the words slightly wrong to spoil it for them."
"I wear headphones everywhere outdoors no matter what. They are not attached to anything, it's just so I can ignore anything going on at street that I don't fancy. Bowing the head and walking straight on nonchalantly whilst a mugging takes place does not embolden one's pride."
I once did a shite in a new girlfriends house that was so large that it wouldn't flush. I used her hair brush to poke it into more flushable chunks.
I often rip the wing mirrors off of cars that are parked on the pavement and force me to walk in the road. It really boils my piss.

"Been seeing a dude for few years, been on holidays etc. Never been official, just chill and fun. Referred to me as his gf yesterday and now I want to end it. Feel terrible but scared of commitment :"
I worked at a public school and hated my boss. I'd like to pretend I pissed in his water bottle like the other idiots on here but the worst thing I did to him was sign him up to several anarchist newsletters at a Chumbawamba gig
"In the '80s a friend & I created a poster saying a then-famous boy band were appearing at a local record shop. Photocopied several hundred copies and put them up around town. About 100 girls turned up, some of whom were in tears when they discovered it was a hoax."

"Tripping my tits off in a friend's student house I needed a piss, so went to find the toilet. All doors looked the same & I couldn't find it; couldn't find my way back to the living room either. Tried all 3 floors."
"Eventually pissed in the hallway, found the front door, and left."
I never taste it but I absolutely can't get enough of the smell of my ear wax. Reminds me of that damp feet bouncy castle smell.
Every week I take a bunch of bin liners from work. Not bought them in a shop for over 15 years.
I got that pissed once I started speaking to a subway sign thinking it was a real bloke- got a little confused why he wasn't responding after 5 minutes

"Hire car scraped the wall pretty badly in an underground car park in Antibes. A few days later, finally, it rained and I found the muddiest puddle in the Alpes-Maritimes and smeared mud all over both sides of the car, hiding all the scratches. Surprisingly, got away with it."

"My friends ask why I'm not bored at work despite having the same crap job for 20 years, no promotions. Truth is, I won a fat wodge on the lottery and quit ages ago. I now spend most of my days playing xbox. I don't want them to know else they'll start scrounging money off of me"
"When I make a cup of tea for my 90 year old Father, I always pour his from the pot first."
He is of the generation that isn't bothered about getting the scummy bits. He is just happy that someone is doing something for him. I don't like the scummy bits.
"I once dropped a friend's copy of WCW vs NWO on the Nintendo64 in toilet whilst having a piss. When I gave the game back, the piss leaked out of the cartridge and broke their console."
I've been in love with my wife's best friend for 20 years and am fairly sure she feels the same. Neither of us could ever hurt my wife by admitting this or taking it any further but is getting harder to ignore since she got divorced a few years back.
Out of curiosity I just rubbed Deep Heat cream all over my bell end. I won't be repeating this experiment.
"I once had a play fight with a mate that went wrong. I ended up with strangle bruises all around my neck and made up a story that I'd been attacked by a tramp. My workmates made me go give a police report, which was total fiction, and had a whip round the whole office for me"

Sometimes I get a rotisserie chicken at Sainsburys and tell the self-serve till that it's a bag of onions.

When I was a teenager in the 80s I collected pictures of Princess Diana. My mum thought I was a royalist but really they were wank fodder.
"When someone thanks me for a piece of work I say Jizz! so it sounds like Cheers! said quickly. I've done this for 10+ years & no-one has ever picked me up on it, as they will probably never say Sorry, did you say Jizz? & I will say No, I said Cheers, why would I say Jizz?"

I used civil service equipment and resources to run the admin of a village cricket club for years. Sorry taxpayers
As a teenager I would wank 4-5 times per day. I deposited my load in tissue & ditched it under my bed. I came home one day to my brother and father emptying out the growing collection from under my bed. Apparently I was the pervert...pair of wank handling weirdos.
"Every day I regret having a third child, the family would be so much better if she'd never been born"

At my gym you need to pay a pound for a towel then put it in the towel bin after using it but I've always just took them home. I've got about 15 in the cupboard
"My wife and I had a ding dong sexy session in the kitchen, A cucumber was used and it was a jolly good time. What wasn't a good time was seven o'clock in the morning when our six year old woke us up while eating it. She's 19 now and I will never tell her."
Few weeks before moving out of uni I knocked flatmate's harddrive on floor. Was home alone so out it back. Turns out was broken & had only copy of photos of when their divorced parents were together. Denied all knowledge when me & other 3 flatmates were confronted while crying.
Couple of years ago at Christmas I was skint. So every time I went to Morrison's I'd nick one of the large toys they have on the way out - I even had one of those massive 50 quid toblerones. Just popped it in the trolley and strolled out. My son thought Xmas was awesome
I don't know how to pronounce my friend's name. We've known each other for years so I can't ask her now.

"When I started my current job 5 years ago, I was too shy to use the kitchen. Told everyone I don't eat lunch. I am starving everyday whilst everyone cooks food around me."
The team next to ours at work rang a bell when they made a sale. I get in an hour before everyone else and sabotage their bell. Every time they get a new one. They have stopped getting new ones. I feel no guilt.
I put up a passive aggressive note at work about people stealing milk but I only did it so I can carry on and I'm not a suspect

I was once too scared to walk up the dark stairs in my house to go to the toilet that I opened the front door and shat on the doorstep. My parents assumed it was a dog but I have the feeling my dad always knew it was human shit.
Once had a wank whilst watching Porn on my phone in my room. Little did I know my phone was still connected to the wireless bose speaker downstairs in the kitchen where my girlfriend was sat having dinner with her friends.
Years ago I borrowed a porn video and I decided to watch it at my nans while she was out shopping. Unfortunately the video got jammed in the player so I had to leave it. When she got it repaired the repairman played the video to show it was working - nearly killed her with shock!

I'm liking every post ... but secretly I'm hoping that the whole bloody ceiling collapses onto the kitchen island unit with its integral mood lighting and built-in Nespresso machine.
"My wife insisted that I go to the gym. She couldn't understand why I was putting more weight on. It may have been due to the fact I didn't go, preferring instead to eat a large donner kebab in the car and wet my hair/face with the kebab juice to look like sweat to fool her."
"When my gran died she left me 10k to help with my education. I spent the lot on rare Magic The Gathering cards, and later became a university dropout. Don't regret it much, to be honest."

I once did work experience at a local newspaper and hated it so I used to fix the in-house contests so my mates won.
We had twins a year ago. When they were about 3 months old I gave them both a bath without making sure who was who. My daughter might now actually be her sister.
"I stole a kid's gameboy advance at a daycare and swapped it with mine since the battery was low and I didn't have a charger. The screen broke literally the next day and he got a free, gameboy replacement in the form of mine. I am now a firm believer in karma."
As a joke I called the 'How is my Driving' number on my mates van with a farcical tale of terrible driving. He was fired later that week.
"When I was 17 and learning to drive, I backed out without looking and ran over my neighbour's cat. Told my dad in tears. He scraped up the remains, we got in the car, and he drove 100 miles to be on the safe side before we buried it in a wood. They never found out. Thanks Dad."
I took chemistry at university because I thought I'd become a narcotics kingpin and make millions like Breaking Bad. But I'm shit at chemistry so instead now I work a deadend job in a bank

My nephew had a square head when he came out. I couldn't complement them on their child because I didn't want to lie

"In 1976, at a pizzeria in Boston, Massachusetts, I took my stained, greasy paper napkin, refolded it neatly, put it back in the middle of the table's napkin dispenser and walked out."
A competitor of the tech company I work for gives away branded socks at trade shows. I have many pairs and wear them often. My boss would sack me if he knew...
Some bloke sat opposite me on the train was being a selfish prick with his massive laptop. No number of nudges would get him to concede any of the 70% of table depth he monopolised. So I ate my banana and smeared it all over the back of his laptop.
"One of the taps in the toilets on the business park I work is quite high pressured, each time I go for a piss I tighten the tap so hard that when the next person uses it they inevitably undo it too quick and get piss wet through, it helps me get through the day"
When I first got a mobile phone in the mid 90s I programmed in the numbers of a row of phone boxes in the middle of the town centre.
I'd sit on a nearby bench eating my lunch whilst watching confused shoppers desperately trying to answer the ringing phones.
I am a 36 year old man and am genuinely gutted that my little girl will grow out of Disney movies soon. To the point while watching the bit in frozen when the parents died I had a lump in my throat.
"After watching Frozen, all I could think was If you had sex with Elsa, would she freeze your nob?"
"It's my first day at school, and I'm standing on the railings looking at the road outside. Suddenly, a strange boy pulls me off and I fall to the ground. I hope he dies, I think to myself. The next day the entire school is gathered to be informed that he was killed by a car."

"My grandad ran a shop and when he died I found nearly a hundred grand in twenties under his bed he'd hidden from the taxman. Been spending it ever since, but they're changing to a new design next year and I'm not even halfway through."
I was in charge of restructuring at a major company and had to pick between two offices which one would be closed down. I pretended to agonise over the decision but actually I just picked the one that was in a town that voted for Brexit. Took me 5 minutes tops.
I work at a suit rental company and once found approx £300 in the jacket pocket. Either a high-roller or drug money...but without hesitation I kept it to pa ymy rent.
Customer never called in for it so I'm guessing he had too much money anyway.
"In my younger years the guy I hated most at work once asked me for a rollie. I said sure, faced away and quickly nipped out a long pube to roll up with the tobacco. He seemed to enjoy the rollie, but it was Drum so I doubt he noticed much"
For years and years I made plans to get revenge on the guy that bullied me at school. Elaborate fantasies of torture and humiliation. Then one day I dared to google him and found he died of an overdose when he was 21. All that time wasted.
"My mother is getting more and more frail, and I'm the only child of hers to actually spend any time looking after her. My siblings haven't raised a finger. So, I've manipulated her into giving me everything in her will. I cannot wait to see the looks on their faces."
I made coffee for my workmate twice a day and each week I upped the amount of coffee by half a teaspoon. He was on 13½ teaspoons of coffee per cup when I finally told him.

Years ago my uncle revealed as a child he was repeatedly molested by the priest who ran his school. So one night I broke into the cemetery where he was buried armed with a sledgehammer and smashed the fucker's gravestone to pieces. It's still smashed to this day. No regrets.
"I dislike a work colleague so much that whenever he goes on holiday I set Spotify on his work computer to play Lostprophets on loop all week, so he gets the blame/credit for them getting extra royalties."
I don't have any social media profiles. I tell people it's because I'm worried about privacy and Big Brother but actually I slept with a girl when backpacking 5 years ago and knocked her up. I deleted them all so she couldn't come after me for the child support.
I used to work at a Zoo when I was a teenager. At £1.80 an hour and with no stockchecks I justified stealing £100 cash & about 8 magnums a shift
"I am the Chief Technology Officer of a major household name company, responsible for cybersecurity on multiple critical systems. All my passwords for everything are Password123"
I always piss in the sink of Virgin trains. Mainly because it's exactly the right height for my cock and it prevents any risk of shoe pissing. But also because of the hateful recorded voice.
I monitor the state of my marriage by the number of exes I would happily sleep with. Things are quite good at the moment and I'm down to just two.
I got my brother drunk to get him to post a confession on here. His confession was shit and I apologise for its shitness
When I was a kid we went on holidays to centerparcs. I made friends with anothr kid there but by the end of the week I realised he was a prick. So just before we left I gave his Gameboy a bath in a pond. I'd say sorry now but I realise I totally have forgotten his name

"Second week as a postman & I had no idea where some mail should be delivered. Scared, I took them home and buried them in the garden."

"I hate Marmite. My then girlfriend loves it and I told her I love it too. Now I'm married to her, so have to tell her I just dont fancy it right now. Been married 17 years!"

In the mid 90s I acquired the chequebook of our arsehole deputy head. I wrote several very generous cheques on his behalf to various local charities. He was in the Rotary Club so received constant thanks. He was also homophobic so I made sure the last one was £200 to Stonewall.

When the barriers are all open at the train station I derive slightly more amusement than I should from going through the barrier with the X on rather than the one with the arrow.
I used to work at an antivirus software company in Dublin which for some dodgy revenue-related reason ran a cashback scheme. Anyone whose name and address went into a particular database got sent a cheque for £25. Me and my friends made a fucking fortune. #symantec

"Worked Sundays in Millets. Volunteered to sort the stock room to avoid actual work. Regularly invited my mate in under the premise I was showing him tents. Instead we threw coat hangers across the room to see if they'd land on a rail. Never sold a tent, shop closed. Wasn't arsed."
I used to swap all the price stickers around as I perused the HMV sale so every album I wanted to buy was £2.99. So it's probably my fault it went bust.

One of my flatmates labels everything she owns as hers and it pisses me off so I go out my way to use her stuff. I eat all her food and drink her juice more than I do my own and she'll never know it's me.
I didn't have money for the Dartford crossing years ago. So as I approached the barrier I put my foot down and drove straight through. The barrier bounced off my bonnet. I wish I could have seen the cashiers face. I still laugh about it now

"Ever since the fesshole tweet about the woman who is going to have an affair unless her husband starts doing housework by Xmas, I've been doing a fuck load more housework."

"A woman rudely pushed in front of me to get to the cash machine, but it wouldn't spit her money out. She stormed into the bank and as soon as she was out of sight £250 appeared. I took it, walked away and had a blinding weekend."
We used to play 'the central line game' which is where you hold a fart until the doors open at the station. Then you release a cloud of abuse between the pole and the glass onto an unknown passenger of the train. Walk out and view their face as they realise. Sorry.
"My meeting on another floor was cancelled, so I just sat in the loo for an hour and played Call of Duty on my phone."
A workmate became tiresomely obsessed with the gym and littered the kitchen with huge buckets of protein powder. So we started topping it up with sugar-rich Cadbury's drinking chocolate. He couldn't understand why he wasn't getting results.

"Whilst working on the Trisha Show I once walked in on Danny from Hear'Say in his pants in his dressing room. No bad behaviour here, but the whole sentence feels like it needed to be confessed."

My earliest sexual memory was a crush on Mrs Spoon from Button Moon. Even 40 years later I still find myself aroused by her.
I am stoned on most school runs.
When wearing headphones I think that cos I can't hear others they can't hear me. I've taken to farting loudly in public places. It happens so often that I have developed a special vacant look for my face so that people don't tell me off

I really dislike the tongue waggle part of my son breastfeeding. It's put me off any kind of nipple foreplay for life.

"I stole about £10 worth of pick and mix at the cinema. The queue was too long and I couldn't be arsed. It was so easy, I'll probably do it again."
When I was a kid I used to think it was funny to fart in the faces of celebrities when they appeared on the TV. Once I farted in Terry Wogan's face and shat all over the TV screen. It looked like melted Toblerone.

Had to buy travel Sudocream today. 30g @ £1.75!! 175g @ £3.00. Ridiculous price for the travel one. So I stole it. Yes I can afford it. But that's just taking the Pee-wee Herman.

"I met a lovely guy on Grindr who didn't want anything more than a quick shag. He was handsome, shy and gentle, but I only saw him once. A while later, I met him again when he baptised my Roman Catholic friends' son. I think he recognised me, too. I've never told anyone till now."
"While working for a tech company a few years back, I needed the loo so I shat in a laptop that was about to be shipped."
"I buy normal, cheap loo roll for my family, and coconut oil flushable toilet wipes for myself which I cleverly hide behind a pack of sanitary towels. Don't even feel slightly guilty for hogging the bum comfort."
"Following divorce I had to take in lodgers, a northern couple of limited charm. Whenever I heard one of them taking a shower I'd run the hot water in the kitchen so their shower ran cold. The shrieks always made me feel better."

"When I was 8, I needed a shit whilst at a friends house. He had no toilet paper, so I begrudgingly used a towel and blamed his other mate. They didn't speak much afterwards."
Despite not really liking her as a person I am far too sexually attracted to my wife's best friend. I flirt with her by text and worry what I might say next.
I went to a big house party and did an drugs poo in the girl's parents' ensuite. I didn't realise the toilet was not connected to the water mains until I heard a thud not a splash. I finished and left without telling anyone.
"I had an affair with a work colleague and had sex with her up until she gave birth to her husband's child. They say sex may help the onset of giving birth, I may have helped it on the way.. I'm not proud at all and the whole thing haunts me still.."
"When my ex and I got together, he went down on me while I was on my period. He must've known, but I'm not sure. When he'd finished I noticed that he had a blob of blood on his lower lip, so I kissed him and ate it so he wouldn't know and freak out."
"When I was about 8 my parents asked me if I wanted an ice cream or a donut, while standing next to an ice cream stand. I chose the donut, the ice cream man looked a bit upset, and later that night I cried myself to sleep over it."

"Years ago I worked in an office and told everyone I didn't like cheese. One day I was alone and hungry, so raided the fridge and stole the boss's cheese. When she got back she was really angry, and had a massive go at everyone - except me, because she knew I didn't like cheese"

"I'm a gay man who likes getting done by older, unremarkable, 'straight' married men. There's loads out there who are up for it, as their menopausal wives are no longer interested in sex. I like the public service/philanthropy aspect of it and the sex is mostly great too."
I quite fancy Katie Hopkins and I hate myself for it.
I pretend to be my wife on a well known swinging site to get hit on by men

"I'm a journalist for a big national outlet and I'm often tasked with tracking people down after horrible shit happened to them, terror victims etc. 90% of the time I pretend they said no because I feel too guilty about contacting them"
"I checked a book out from the school library, then I fell ill for about a month. When I recovered I was scared of returning the book late, so I hid the book in my room and avoided the library for the rest of the year. 8 years later the book is still where I hid it."
I was shaving my foof and couldn't find a mirror to see if I'd done ok so I took a picture with the iPad. The iPad which is linked to my son's iPod. I think he's seen my muff in all its shaven glory.
"My wife snores so much that if she falls asleep before me, I'll often brew a big fart and let it off, right in her face. She doesn't wake up and it makes me laugh myself to sleep!"
Drank wine with wife last night and forgot to ask the tooth fairy to visit our daughter
"I refuse to buy a poppy because all the WWI and almost all the WWII veterans are dead so my money would be going to people who joined the forces to murder people in other counties. However, my boss is ex forces and not wearing a poppy would be career limiting, so I stole mine."
My dad was a train driver for British Rail and when I was 8 he sneaked me on a train full of passengers and let me drive it we had to swap over at stations #wehadtoswapoveratstations

When I was 16 and living at home with my parents I was with a girl who was a squirter. It was so much that we used to pull out a duvet that was under my bed and put it down before sex. When my mate would sleep over I'd give him that duvet to sleep

"At my 1st office job, I was in charge of office supplies and the post room. When I was skint I used to sell stolen toner cartridges on ebay. I didn't even have to pay for packaging or postage. I got away with it for a year until I found a better paying job."

"One drunken night outside a bar, a friend and I happened upon a girl who was selling earrings and piercings. We paid her fee to pierce the ear of a guy who was passed out against the wall of the bar. She did it. Still feel bad about that."
I have quite a few relatives whose names I'm not completely sure about and I'm in my 30s now so I think it's too late to ask
"I volunteered to distribute forms for the 1981 census, then sat on a beach and filled in about one hundred of them myself."
I got home one day to find a copy of my cunt of a neighbour's screewfix catalogue wrongly delivered. Along with some old boxes I labelled up with his address and fake ripped up letters I tucked them into a pile of someones flytipped crap. I think he ended up paying the £1000 ...
Last Christmas I was staying over at my sister's house. I drunkenly ate all of my niece's advent calendar and blamed it on her 5-year-old brother. He got a huge bollocking.

"Back in the days before digital, I would patrol Trafalgar Sq in my lunch hour, offering to take pictures for tourists with their own cameras. I would always take 3 or 4 for them, encouraging different poses, and deliberately cut their heads off in each one."
"After a two week drinking binge I shat my pants. So I walked to the beach, washed my arse in the sea and tried to throw my pants in, but they blew out of my hand and got stuck on the pier. I tried to walk away quickly, but shat my jeans, so I just walked home in shitty jeans."

I named my son Edward after Edward Elizabeth Hitler from Bottom.
I once dreamt that my next door neighbour made my dog suck him off. I now can't help but not really trust him. I mean... no smoke without fire?

It was really only sheer luck that it didn't kill her.
"In my 20s I got drunk and shat myself when walking home. A senior manager from work lived near so I asked to use his bog. I tried to flush my pants down the bog and caused a block and a flood. Whilst he dealt with this, I nicked a porn VHS out his stash, went home and had a wank."
"The only thing that stopped me from hanging myself 5 weeks ago was while buying rope at B&Q, their antiquated systems couldn't take contactless/Apple Pay and I'd left my wallet at home. I forced myself to see the funny side and drove home. I'm still here, so that's something."

"Partner started smoking again - when we met they vaped exclusively and I didn't think it was a big deal. The smoking does my head in. Ugly, stinky, unhealthy. Want to be supportive, but as a non-smoker am pretty sure I'm being a preachy cunt."

I don't want to go to bed so I can stay up drinking. Help me.

I once ate a four finger KitKat out of the work kitchen fridge that wasn't mine. At the time I was of the mind that four finger KitKats are for rich bitches and so it was an act of chocolately wealth distribution. I now have doubts hence the confession.
"I walk from the train station to my office everyday with headphones in my ears, but not listening to anything, not even plugged in to amything. It's all so I can pretend I don't hear the homeless people asking for spare change or food."
Going through a carwash puts me in warm and fuzzy stoned-like trance and I never want it to end.

I like to do roly polys down the aisles of busy libraries when no one is looking!
I was the person who sabotaged your clothes spinner that - despite your protestations - didn't do anything other than make your clothes dizzy. And a lot of noise. So much noise. Laughed my ass off too when the engineer you were shagging couldn't fix it - I'd only cut one wire.

I've been with my husband for fifteen years. He was my first everything but he had a more promiscuous past. I said I was fine with that but I'm not. I feel like I missed out. He said something about what other women like in bed and I worry he compares me to his exes. I hate it.
I put my mum's engagement ring down the toilet when I was about five or six. I've no idea why I did it and to this day she doesn't know what happened to it.

I'm 34 and married but to this day I still buy the same brand of chewing gum that the girl I lost my virginity to at 16 used to chew because it reminds me of her. I always get a pang of excitement when I offer one to my wife.

I emigrated 'for a job' in the hope the wife and kids wouldn't follow. They did. My new job is shit. Karma is a cunt.

I opened a plastic portion container of honey and put it carefully in the bottom of a work colleague's laptop bag. He was a cunt but it was still a cuntish thing to do.

"On more than one occasion, I've turned around and accidentally caught an annoying, hyperactive child upside the head with the corner of my laptop bag. It's extra satisfying if the parent then reprimands the now crying child for being a nuisance and getting in my way."
"One Christmas when I had a Saturday job in the Argos stockroom, I drew increasingly graphic cocks on all the Magna Doodles then sealed them back in the boxes. My only regret is not witnessing the absolute scenes on Christmas morning."

"A close friend's wife sucked me off whilst he and my wife were downstairs. Nothing had ever happened between us before, or since. It still seems like a dream..."

I've got a bag of sweets in the kitchen that I keep refilling secretly so my wife doesn't know I'm eating too much. She's never questioned why the same bag seems to have lasted 6 months. Or she knows and just accepts it. We will never speak of this.

"I still have feelings for my ex, who broke up with me 5 years ago. It's not even like we had a healthy relationship, but remembering the crappy things he did doesn't make the love go away. Everywhere I go, I hope that I'll run into him. I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone."

I replied it was and confirmed that we could take a look at her painful abscess that afternoon. Good she said as she'd be making the journey on foot. If there was a hell, I'd be going there directly."
"I snitched on a student union president who was bitching online about a teacher. Afraid of the repercussions I submitted the complaint in the name of one of his close friends.  The president was deposed against the rules of the NUS constitution by the college, and this friend was incredulous when said teacher thanked them for reporting the post."

"I accidentally found the hooker profile of a colleague. It really was an accident that I found it, she runs two Twitter profiles and Twitter recommended I follow the second one and I went hang on, that's Chloe from work, I already follow her. Clicked and OMG. Anyway it was rather titillating looking at all the pics but you really need to be more careful."
I have a mutual follow that I fancy so badly I've dreamed about them. They're possibly the most beautiful person I've ever seen and funny too. I'm aching in the groin just typing this. Might just go off to check their instagram to see if they've put a new selfie up.

Still feel bad 32 years later."

I once voted Conservative

When I was a paper boy an old lady asked me to see her out as she backed her car down her drive and on to the road. Waving her on I deliberately let her run her car into her metal gatepost just to see how it would damage her rear wing. To be fair I was only a child. Who in their right mind would ask a child to do that?

I've been seeing a married man for 12 years. It's a hopeless situation because he will never leave her. It's heartbreaking and now it's too late in life for me to meet someone else
"Whenever I feel a bit broke I steal a laptop from work, sell it, and delete it from our asset database. Nobody has a clue, it's been eight years."
When my toddler gives me her bogies I just east them
We're moving offices and I'm sad because every day for the last eighteen years I've pissed in the sink of this one - I'm fairly sure by now i've claimed it as mine
"I'm addicted to having strangers cum in me. I go out all the time to cheat on my partner of 10+ years, arranging hook-ups in every shabby public loo or quiet alley within a few miles of our home. Seriously, it must be into the hundreds of people now. I'm never going to stop. I've had to stop sleeping with my partner as I'm worried about STIs."
My girlfriend has developed an embarrassing medical condition and now I want to leave them
"My partner did a Bad Crime five years ago. Things got a bit rocky, relationship-wise a year ago, and in anger I told them I had evidence of what they did I do and that I'd put it in a safe-deposit box I hadn't. Overnight their attitude changed, now they're much more loving and trying harder to make everything work. We've moved in together now.  I know they're only seeming like they love me now because they're terrified of 15+ years in prison, but I don't care, I need affection."
"I stole money from my grandmother's purse constantly for about five years. Everyone just thought she was forgetful and was spending the money. Turns out she had dementia.I'm really sorry - I kept thinking about how I'd pay her back when I got older, and then she died."
"Saw a group of pished English lads who I thought were probably in town for the Edinburgh festival walk out of a pub. Noticed one of them dropped their wallet as they walked off. I went over, picked the wallet up, dived into the pub, went to the toilet, pocketed the cash – about £60 - and left the wallet/cards on the cubicle cistern. As I was walking out they walked back in - askng bar staff if anyone had handed in a wallet - and I just strolled past and away up the road. I really needed the money at the time - was kipping on a pal's sofa,"
One time I was out of a building that had two doors on the front. They weren't double doors they were separated by like 6 ft. And as I wall out I see a blind guy with a cane and dark shades walking towards me so I stop and hold the door open and he hears that and smiles/nods ...... and walks to the other door that I'm not holding open and feels that it is closed with his cane and I try to think of a way to tell him that he's at the wrong door without sounding like a jerk and when I cant after like 2 seconds I minor panic and just walk away.
"I constantly steal from my friends - clothes, money, food, you name it."
I fingered my best mates girlfriend at a nightclub and then got him to smell my finger and told him it was a from a rando.
I nearly killed a friend while messing around with my dads shotgun as kids. He must never know it was loaded I didn't realiseand I wonder all the time how and why the trigger got stuck. Thank fuck it did. #Ididntrealise
"I once accidentally set fire to a pretty hefty part of a local school. I was 14 and it was summer holidays, hanging around the empty school with a pal, bored and looking for fun.  We found a huge stack of recently delivered gym mats under some tarpaulins. We had a lighter that had no right to go up as quick as they did.   We ran to a local swimming pool and rang the fire brigade. We then sauntered back to watch the mayhem and clean up. For some reason we also decided to walk up to some policemen and told them we saw who did it, a pair of punks with green spiky hair.   My mum cooked us a hero's dinner that night."
I still wake up most nights crying because I've been dreaming about a girl I haven't seen for 12 years. I have to lie to my wife about why I'm upset.
"A boy came back to mine after a date. He went to leave straight after sex. I was scared I wouldn't see him again, so when I noticed he'd left his watch on the bed I pushed it under the duvet, so he'd have to see me again to get it back."
I had a wank in the back seat of my girlfriend's mum's car on a long journey while they were both in the front.
I got my phone repaired for free because EE didn't check where I actually bought my phone.
When me and my mates were 18 or so and had ran out of money on a night out we'd seek out this old gay guy that would pay us a tenner each to put our feet on his face for 10 mins back at his flat. This was the mid 90s and a t... #Thiswasthemid90sandatennerwentfurtherthanitdoesnow
Once had a wank in a bush in the middle of my paper round
"For the last 10 years I have been falsifying records about student final grades at a large, reputable UK university, because I inexplicably have super user rights. I am aware that failing idiots have been employed at some of the finest firms in the world after I gave them firsts. There is no quality assurance."
"I have children with two different women, and I think I love the one I'm not married to more."

I have installed a raspberry pi with a custom antenna in my basement with the sole purpose of stealing the neighbors wifi signal it's optimal there for big downloads. #itsoptimalthere
I've been married for quite a few years and had a two year affair just because I could get away with it. No one even suspects as am so well behaved and 'couldn't possibly do that'

"I blamed the dog's tail for knocking out one if my front teeth, which my family still believe 50 years later. I actually did it sweeping the floor whilst holding the broom in my mouth."
I had a wank and came in my hand and had no where to wipe it so I ate it. Then this got to be a habit until one day I thought what the fuck am I doing? and stopped.
"When I used to walk home drunk from the pub when I lived in Headingly, at some times of the year, it would take me 3x longer, because I'd stop to pick the slugs up off the pavement and put them in people's front gardens, so that they wouldn't get stepped on. When I moved to Birkenshaw, I'd often drunkenly sing to the local livestock if I saw them in the field. They seemed to enjoy it."
I sometimes look forward to when some of my family members die just in case I get anything from them. One of them's a Jehovah's Witness though and is giving all her shit to Kingdom Hall and it pisses me right off.
Genuinely not sure if I fingered my sister once or just dreamt it and I'm too afraid to ask.
One of the perks of having an anxiety disorder is that I can order benzos straight from the doctor. I wait a while to avoid arousing suspicion then I order more so I can spend a couple days fucked on valium and playing minecraft. My confession is that I'm too proud of how well it works.
"If I'm skint when my housemate's at his mum's for the week, I use masking tape to mark all his alcohol bottles, drink them, then fill them back up before he gets back when my benefits come in."
"I discovered masturbation when I sat in front of a jet in a jacuzzi when I was 8. I used to pretend I was looking for interesting patterns in the brickwork while I got a hands-free wank. My dad and sister were always sat right there, and after I started spunking I kept having to go to the loo to clean up. I got sick of having to do that though so I eventually stopped. Then my dad got a bath with jets in it..."
I'm too much of a coward to break up with women so I act like a twat so they'll dump me. Once this wasn't working so I pretended to be overly possessive and not let her go out without me to get her to chuck me.

"After seeing the earlier carrot confession, I remember that I once used a courgette as a dildo and put it back in the fridge. My friend made a meal with it and I didn't tell him. I washed it, though, I'm not a savage."
The restaurant I was working for was going under. I knew I wouldn't get paid so I stole £5000 out of the safe and went to Barbados for 3 months.
"I drunkenly set up an obstacle course from jenga blocks and household items for my housemate's pet hamster. Unfortunately, it couldn't jump the mug of wine hazard, fell in head first, and was never the same again."
"When I'm in the shower and I happen to have the runz, I sometimes just do a shit right there and mash the lumps down the plughole. I take any clogged hair out first, though, I'm not a savage."
"As a supposed vegetarian I was caught eating a 1990's, non vegan sausage roll by my then girlfriend. I told her it was a very convincing vegetarian one, and she wanted a taste. I let her. Never told her. I think she's still a vegetarian 25 years on, but I'm not sure as we ..."
"I had a monster night out and had a massive hang over the next morning. Rather than calling in sick, I told work that someone had tried to mug me and I was a bit shaken up so couldn't come in. I have no idea why I lied."

"In every Twitter poll, I always vote for the one I think will be bottom, just to see if I can guess it right."
"About 25 years ago I wanted to go to a club with a girl but you needed shoes to get in and I didn't have any. I went round to friend's house who had a nice pair I'd borrowed before, to ask if I could borrow them again. There was no one in but I could see all the shoes lined up inside. The back door was open so I went in and took them. I was too embarrassed to give them back afterwards so I chucked them away. I still feel bad about it."
"I have been with my wife for 11 years. We have two children. In a conversation early in our relationship we agreed that peeing while in the shower is disgusting. I guess I believed it at the time, but now probably piss in 75% of showers I take."
"My wife and I don't have children and we never will.  We got a kitten and it was the best thing that ever happened to us.   One day a neighbour knocked on the door, saying she thought our cat had been hit by a car. He was already dead. She was sobbing throughout.   Our neighbours on both sides were heartbroken and this has brought us closer, but I have never known pain like it. I put on a brave face for my wife because I love her and I don't want her to feel pain, but every day I miss him so much that it tears me in two. He was my best friend"
I got curious and stuck a carrot up my arse. Then panicked and thought my parents would notice the missing carrot so returned it to the cupboard. We ate it for dinner that night.

"My Mum thought she was losing her marbles while adding up the cash from the church stall she used to run, coming up well short of her calculations most weeks. That's because I found where she hid it, and nicked £20-£30 every Friday to go and get shitfaced in town. As it happens she has dementia now, so I basically just gave her a preview about 23 years ahead of time."
I have been living a double life with two partners for over a year and am finally getting up the courage to be with the one I really want to be with. I'm also worried that my desire for and pursuit of more and more wild sexual encounters is putting my entire life off track.

"I have a massive foot fetish. I can't get my mind off women's soles. I can't help it, all my life I've just wanted to look at them and it turns me on. I don't know why."

"My name is Frank. I'm a 27-year-old Englishman, with all the negative connotations you'd imagine that carries. Yes, even that one.  I have few friends. Most of them are women. I don't know why this is - my family is very female dominated, maybe that's it. Anyhow.  Most of my friends are women. Interesting, intelligent, competent, attractive women. And, with maybe two exceptions, I fancy all of them.  I don't have ugly friends. I'm worried, in my heart of hearts, that I'm only friends with the ones that I find fuckable. That's my confession"

"As soon as our son goes to bed my wife drops any pretence of still wanting to be in a relationship with me. I want to leave but know she would use it against me in divorce proceedings and as an excuse to stop me from seeing the kid. I suspect she doesn't leave for the same reasons.
