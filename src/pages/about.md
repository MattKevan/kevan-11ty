Throughout my career I've focused on building and growing high-performing creative teams, developing processes and ways of working that deliver real value while also providing a creative and supportive environment.

I'm also interested in the crossover between art, design and technology, always on the lookout for new tools and technologies that can be used as part of the creative process. 

As part of this, I've been working with machine learning and generative AI since 2018

 new technologies and tools, looking at how they can be used creatively as part of the the design and artistic process. 
Since 2021 I've been working with generative adversarial networks (GANs), combining human and machine creativity to create something new and unexpected.
