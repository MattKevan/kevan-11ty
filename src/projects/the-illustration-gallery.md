## Background

Founded in 2007 by Oliver Jelf, The Illustration Gallery was one of the only galleries in the UK to focus on contemporary illustration. Over the next four years it exhibited the work of some of the world's leading illustrators, including Tom Gauld, Rob Ryan, Yuko Shimizu, eBoy and Sam Weber.
 
## Branding and identity

The brief was to create a striking, instantly recognisable brand, with the same quality and feel as a national contemporary art gallery, such as the Barbican and Tate Modern. It needed to be As the gallery was to be a showcase for contemporary illustration, the brand needed to work well with any style of artwork, without overshadowing or clashing with it.

<p>After working through a whole range of ideas, I opted for a logo that sat at the top-right corner of the page, either by itself or on top of artwork, to act rather like a quality mark. 

I deliberately kept the identity minimal, to act as a neutral container for the artwork and not favour a particular artist or style.

## Publications

As well as the branding, I also designed exhibitiion flyers, posters, brochures and the signage outside the gallery. As before, the goal was to keep the design as simple as possible to ensure the focus remains on the artwork.
