A simple plugin to create manage and manage tabs on WooCommerce product pages. I decided to write my own plugin after I realised such basic functionality wasn't included in Woocommerce and a third-party plugin would be yet another annual licencing fee.

The plugin adds a new post type – each custom tab is a post and therefore fully supports the block editor, though some blocks may not be relevant. There's also a UI to manage the order and set visibility. This works on both default and custom tabs, though currently changes are applied to every product.

 I'm planning to support tab groups by category or specific products, as well as a bunch of other improvements and features.
